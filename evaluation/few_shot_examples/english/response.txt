This is a question about choosing the explanation in bold that best fits the writer’s position expressed in the main clause.

First, let’s understand what the main clause says.

Original sentence:

(2) In most scientific studies it is difficult to determine how much people are eating, because appetite regulation is a field of staggering complexity.

We need to choose the best bolded text that explains why “it is difficult to determine how much people are eating” in scientific studies.

Option A: as it is now (i.e., leave it as is: “because appetite regulation is a field of staggering complexity.”)

Option B: researchers seldom ask the right questions

Option C: different foods have varying impacts on the digestive system

Option D: people generally submit their own data and this isn’t seen as reliable

Option E: psychological factors determine why certain foods are more popular than others

Our task is to pick the best option that explains why it’s difficult to determine how much people are eating in scientific studies.

Let’s analyze each option.

Option A: “because appetite regulation is a field of staggering complexity.”

Is that a good explanation? Hmm.

Option B: “because researchers seldom ask the right questions.”

Does this make sense with the main clause?

Main clause: “In most scientific studies it is difficult to determine how much people are eating, because researchers seldom ask the right questions.”

Is the writer saying that? Does the context in the passage suggest that?

Option C: “because different foods have varying impacts on the digestive system.”

Does that explain why it’s difficult to determine how much people are eating?

Hmm… Probably not directly.

Option D: “because people generally submit their own data and this isn’t seen as reliable.”

Is that relevant? Does that explain why it’s difficult to determine how much people are eating in scientific studies?

Yes, that seems plausible: if people generally submit their own data (e.g., self-reporting their consumption), and this isn’t reliable, it’s difficult to determine how much people are eating.

Option E: “because psychological factors determine why certain foods are more popular than others.”

Is that explaining why it’s difficult to determine how much people are eating?

Probably not directly.

Given that the following sentence is:

(3) (Have you ever had to tell your doctor whether you drink beer or binge out on chips or ice cream?)

This suggests that people have to self-report, and perhaps they may not be accurate.

Therefore, Option D seems to fit.

Also, in the previous paragraph, the writer seems to point out that in certain controlled environments (like prisons) where sneaking in unreported chocolate bars is unlikely, interesting insights can be gained.

This implies that in studies outside controlled environments, people might be consuming unreported calories, or not reporting accurately.

Therefore, Option D seems to be the best.

So, the answer is Option D.

To determine the best replacement for the bolded text, we need to find the option that best explains why it is difficult to determine how much people are eating in most scientific studies.

Option D states: “people generally submit their own data and this isn’t seen as reliable.” This directly addresses the challenge researchers face: reliance on self-reported data, which can be inaccurate due to forgetfulness, underreporting, or intentional misreporting. This unreliability makes it difficult to determine actual food intake.

This explanation aligns with the context provided in the subsequent sentence, which mentions the difficulty people might have in accurately reporting their consumption of items like beer, chips, or ice cream to their doctor.

Answer: \boxed{D}
