We are told that for all integer values of \( k \), satisfying \( 1 \leq |k| \leq n \), \( p\left(\frac{1}{k}\right) = k^2 \).  

Our problem is: Given that \( p \) is monic of degree \( 2n \), and that \( p\left(\frac{1}{k}\right) = k^2 \) for \( k = \pm1, \pm2, \ldots, \pm n \), find all other real numbers \( x \) such that \( p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = x^2 \).  

In other words, we are to find all real numbers \( x \) such that \( p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = x^2 \).  

Firstly, note that:  

- The monic polynomial \( p(x) \) is of degree \( 2n \).  

- We have \( 2n \) data points: for \( k = \pm1 \) to \( \pm n \), \( p\left(\frac{1}{k}\right) = k^2 \).  

But there are \( 2n \) distinct values of \( \frac{1}{k} \) (since \( k \) ranges over integers \( \pm1 \) to \( \pm n \), and they are distinct).  

Thus, we have \( 2n \) points \((x, y)\) of the form \(\left(\frac{1}{k}, k^2\right)\).  

Thus, \( p \) is a polynomial of degree \( 2n \) that satisfies \( p\left(\frac{1}{k}\right) = k^2 \) for \( 2n \) values of \( \frac{1}{k} \).  

Wait, but \( p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) - x^2 = 0 \).  

Our equation is \( p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) - x^2 = 0 \).  

Let me define \( q(x) = p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) - x^2 \).  

Our task is to find all real numbers \( x \) such that \( q(x) = 0 \).  

Given the data from the problem, let’s consider that \( q(k) = p\left(\frac{1}{k}\right) - k^2 = 0 \) for \( k = \pm1, \pm2, \ldots, \pm n \).  

Thus, \( q(k) = 0 \) for \( k = \pm1, \ldots, \pm n \).  

Moreover, since \( p \) is a polynomial of degree \( 2n \), then \( p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \) is a rational function of \( x \) of degree \( 2n \) when considered as a function of \( x \).  

But we can consider \( q(x) = p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) - x^2 \).  

Alternatively, let’s consider \( s(x) = x^{2n} p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) - x^{2n+2} \).  

Let me explain:  

We can consider that \( p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = x^{-2n} + a_{2n-1} x^{-2n+1} + \ldots + a_0 \).  

Then multiplying by \( x^{2n} \) gives:  

\( x^{2n} p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = 1 + a_{2n-1} x + a_{2n-2} x^2 + \ldots + a_0 x^{2n} \).  

Similarly, \( x^{2n+2} = x^{2n+2} \).  

Thus, define the polynomial \( s(x) = x^{2n} p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) - x^{2n+2} \).  

But wait, perhaps it’s better to rearrange.  

Let me consider that \( s(x) = x^{2n} \left[p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) - x^2\right] = x^{2n} q(x) \).  

So \( s(x) = x^{2n} q(x) \).  

Since \( q(k) = 0 \) for \( k = \pm1, \ldots, \pm n \), we have \( q(k) = 0 \).  

Thus, \( s(k) = k^{2n} q(k) = 0 \).

s(k) = k²  

q(k) = 0.  

Thus, s(k) = 0.  

s(k) = 0 at x = ±1, ±2, …, ±n.  

x = ±1, ±2, …, ±n.  

Thus, s(x) is a polynomial (not a rational function),  

since x²ⁿq(x) is a polynomial.  

Moreover, s(x) = x²ⁿ[p(1/x) − x²] = x²ⁿp(1/x) − x²ⁿ⁺².  

But x²ⁿp(1/x) = [x²ⁿ][p(1/x)] = p*(x).  

Wait, but x²ⁿp(1/x) is the “reciprocal polynomial” of p(x), evaluated at x.  

But since p(x) is monic of degree 2n, its reciprocal polynomial is monic of degree 2n as well.  

Thus, set t(x) = x²ⁿp(1/x).  

Let me write t(x) = x²ⁿp(1/x) = P*(x).  

P*(x) is the reverse polynomial of p(x).  

p(x) = x²ⁿ + a₂ₙ₋₁x²ⁿ⁻¹ + … + a₀.  

Then t(x) = x²ⁿp(1/x) = x²ⁿ[(1/x)²ⁿ + a₂ₙ₋₁(1/x)²ⁿ⁻¹ + … + a₀] = 1 + a₂ₙ₋₁x + a₂ₙ₋₂x² + … + a₀x²ⁿ.  

So t(x) = p*(x), the reciprocal polynomial of p.  

Thus, s(x) = t(x) − x²ⁿ⁺² = [1 + a₂ₙ₋₁x + a₂ₙ₋₂x² + … + a₀x²ⁿ] − x²ⁿ⁺².  

But x²ⁿ⁺² = x²ⁿ⁺².  

Therefore, s(x) = p*(x) − x²ⁿ⁺².  

We can now write s(x) = p*(x) − x²ⁿ⁺².  

Alternatively, p*(x) − x²ⁿ⁺² = s(x).  

But t(x) = p*(x),  

and s(x) = t(x) − x²ⁿ⁺².  

But our key is that s(x) = x²ⁿq(x).  

Recall that q(k) = 0 for k = ±1, ±2, …, ±n.  

Therefore, s(k) = 0 at x = ±1, …, ±n.  

x = \pm1, …, \pm n  

x = ±1, …, ±n.  

Therefore, s(x) s(x) s(x) is a polynomial that vanishes at x = ±1, ±2, …, ±n.  

x = \pm1, \pm2, …, \pm n  

x = ±1, ±2, …, ±n.  

s(x) s(x) s(x) has roots at x = ±1, …, ±n.  

x = \pm1, …, \pm n  

x = ±1, …, ±n.  

Thus, s(x) s(x) s(x) must be divisible by the monic polynomial whose roots are ±1, ±2, …, ±n.  

\pm1, \pm2, …, \pm n  

±1, ±2, …, ±n.  

Thus, s(x) = m(x) h(x)  

s(x) = m(x) h(x).  

Where m(x) = (x − (−n)) (x − (−n+1)) … (x − (−1)) (x − (1)) … (x − n).  

m(x) = \prod_{k=1}^n (x - k)(x + k) = \prod_{k=1}^n (x^2 - k^2)  

m(x) = ∏k=1ⁿ(x − k)(x + k) = ∏k=1ⁿ(x² − k²).  

Therefore, m(x) = ∏k=1ⁿ(x² − k²) = ∏k=1ⁿ(x² − k²).  

Thus, m(x) m(x) m(x) is a monic polynomial of degree 2n.  

Similarly, since s(x) s(x) s(x) is of degree…  

Let me compute the degree of s(x) s(x) s(x):  

Since s(x) = x²ⁿ p(1/x) − x²ⁿ⁺²,  

Compute t(x) = x²ⁿ p(1/x).  

We have p(x) = x²ⁿ + a₂ₙ₋₁x²ⁿ⁻¹ + ⋯ + a₀.  

Then t(x) = x²ⁿ p(1/x) = x²ⁿ [(1/x)²ⁿ + a₂ₙ₋₁(1/x)²ⁿ⁻¹ + ⋯ + a₀] = 1 + a₂ₙ₋₁x + a₂ₙ₋₂x² + ⋯ + a₀x²ⁿ.  

So t(x) t(x) t(x) is a polynomial of degree 2n.  

What about x²ⁿ⁺²?  

So s(x) = t(x) − x²ⁿ⁺².  

Therefore, s(x) s(x) s(x) is a polynomial of degree max(degree of t(x), degree of x²ⁿ⁺²) = degree(x²ⁿ⁺²).  

So s(x) s(x) s(x) is of degree 2n+2.  

But t(x) t(x) t(x) has degree 2n.  

So s(x) = [degree 2n polynomial] − degree (2n+2) monomial = −x²ⁿ⁺² + [degree ≤ 2n polynomial].  

So the leading term of s(x) s(x) s(x) is −x²ⁿ⁺².  

Thus, s(x) s(x) s(x) is a polynomial of degree 2n+2 with leading coefficient −1.  

So s(x) = −x²ⁿ⁺² + lower degree terms.  

Similarly,  

\( m(x) = \prod_{k=1}^n (x^2 - k^2) \), which is a monic polynomial of degree \( 2n \).  

Therefore, if we factor \( s(x) = m(x) h(x) \),  

and since \( s(x) \) is degree \( 2n+2 \) and \( m(x) \) is degree \( 2n \),  

it follows that \( h(x) \) must be a quadratic polynomial.  

Our plan is to write \( s(x) = m(x) h(x) \).  

Given that \( s(x) \) is degree \( 2n+2 \) with leading coefficient \(-1\),  

and \( m(x) \) is a degree \( 2n \) monic polynomial,  

it follows that \( h(x) \) must be a degree 2 polynomial with leading coefficient \(-1\).  

Thus, \( h(x) = -x^2 + bx + c \).  

Alternatively, since \( s(x) = m(x) h(x) \),  

we can express \( s(x) = (-1) x^{2n+2} + \text{[lower degree terms]} \).  

Also, \( m(x) = x^{2n} + \text{[lower degree terms]} \) (since it is monic of degree \( 2n \)).  

Similarly, \( h(x) = -x^2 + bx + c \).  

Then, \( s(x) = m(x) h(x) = [x^{2n} + \cdots](-x^2 + bx + c) = -x^{2n+2} + \text{[lower degree terms]} \).  

Therefore, the leading term of \( s(x) \) is \(-x^{2n+2}\), which matches.  

Thus, our assertion that \( h(x) \) is degree 2 with leading coefficient \(-1\) is consistent.  

Hence, \( h(x) = -x^2 + bx + c \).  

To find \( b \) and \( c \), we consider:  

\( s(x) = m(x) h(x) = \left[\prod_{k=1}^n (x^2 - k^2)\right](-x^2 + bx + c) \).  

We also know \( s(x) = x^{2n} p(1/x) - x^{2n+2} \).  

Equating these expressions for \( s(x) \):  

Let \( t(x) = x^{2n} p(1/x) = p^*(x) \),  

then \( s(x) = t(x) - x^{2n+2} = p^*(x) - x^{2n+2} \).  

From this,  

\( p^*(x) - x^{2n+2} = m(x) h(x) \).  

Since \( p^*(x) \) is degree \( \leq 2n \), and \( x^{2n+2} \) is degree \( 2n+2 \),  

their difference is degree \( 2n+2 \).  

Writing \( s(x) = -x^{2n+2} + \text{[lower degree terms]} \),  

and \( m(x) h(x) = x^{2n}(-x^2 + bx + c) + \text{[lower degree terms]} \),  

we compute:  

\( m(x) h(x) = (x^{2n} + \text{[lower degree terms]})(-x^2 + bx + c) \).  

The product of \( x^{2n} \) and \(-x^2\) gives \(-x^{2n+2}\).  

Similarly, \( x^{2n} \cdot bx = bx^{2n+1} \),  

and \( x^{2n} \cdot c = cx^{2n} \).  

Thus,  

\( s(x) = m(x) h(x) = -x^{2n+2} + bx^{2n+1} + c x^{2n} + \text{[lower degree terms]}

s(x) = m(x)

h(x) = [x^{2n} + \cdots] \cdot (-x^2 + bx + c) = -x^{2n+2} + b x^{2n+1} + c x^{2n} + [lower degree terms].

So from the above, the coefficient of x^{2n+1} in s(x) is b.

But according to s(x) = -x^{2n+2} + [degree ≤ 2n], the x^{2n+1} term is absent (since p^*(x) has degree ≤ 2n).

Therefore, s(x) has no x^{2n+1} term.

Thus, the coefficient of x^{2n+1} in s(x) is zero.

Therefore, b = 0.

Similarly, let’s now compare the coefficient of x^{2n} in s(x), which is c.

From s(x) = -x^{2n+2} + s_{2n} x^{2n} + [lower degree terms],

the coefficient of x^{2n} in s(x) is s_{2n} = c.

But s(x) = p^*(x) - x^{2n+2}.

So s(x) = [p^*(x)] - x^{2n+2}.

But p^*(x) has degree ≤ 2n.

Therefore, the x^{2n} term in s(x) is given by the x^{2n} term in p^*(x), which is a_0 x^{2n}.

So s(x) = (-x^{2n+2}) + a_0 x^{2n} + [lower degree terms].

Therefore, comparing coefficients, the coefficient of x^{2n} in s(x) is a_0.

Thus, c = a_0.

So c = a_0.

So we have h(x) = -x^2 + c.

But we already have b = 0.

Thus, h(x) = -x^2 + c.

We can now write:  

s(x) = m(x) [-x^2 + c] = [∏_{k=1}^n (x^2 - k^2)] (-x^2 + c).

Similarly, s(x) = -x^{2n+2} + a_0 x^{2n} + [lower degree terms].

We may be able to compute the expression m(x) [-x^2 + c] and match the coefficient of x^{2n}.

Let me first consider m(x) = x^{2n} + [lower degree terms].

Similarly, m(x) ⋅ (-x^2 + c) = -x^{2n+2} + c x^{2n} + [lower degree terms].

Therefore, s(x) = -x^{2n+2} + c x^{2n} + [lower degree terms].

But s(x) = -x^{2n+2} + a_0 x^{2n} + [lower degree terms].

Therefore, c x^{2n} = a_0 x^{2n}.

Thus, c = a_0.

But what about the next term? Let’s consider matching the next coefficient.

Compute m(x) ⋅ (-x^2 + c) = -x^{2n+2} + c x^{2n} + [lower degree terms].

The term of degree x^{2n-2} in s(x) is due to the products:

- The x^{2n-2} term from m(x) multiplied by -x^2.

- The x^{2n-2} term from m(x) multiplied by c.

Let me write m(x) = x^{2n} + m_{2n-2} x^{2n-2} + [lower terms].

Similarly, m(x) ⋅ (-x^2) = (-x^{2n+2} + m_{2n-2} x^{2n} + [lower terms]).

Wait, actually, this may not help us directly without specific terms.

An alternative is to consider the known polynomials.

So m(x) = ∏_{k=1}^n (x^2 - k^2).

Similarly, s(x) = m(x) [-x^2 + c].

Now, consider that s(x) = [-x^{2n+2}] + c x^{2n} + [lower degree terms].

Similarly, expand m(x) [-x^2] and m(x) ⋅ c separately.

Let me compute m(x) ⋅ (-x^2).

Since m(x) is a monic degree 2n polynomial, its highest degree term is x^{2n}.

Therefore, m(x) ⋅ (-x^2) = -x^{2n+2} + [lower degree terms].

Similarly, m(x) ⋅ c = c x^{2n} + [lower degree terms].

Therefore, s(x) = [-x^{2n+2}] + c x^{2n} + [lower degree terms].

Similarly, from the definition of s(x),  

s(x) = [-x^{2n+2}] + s_{2n} x^{2n} + s_{2n-1} x^{2n-1} + ⋯.

But from s(x) = p^*(x) - x^{2n+2},

p^*(x) = 1 + a_{2n-1} x + a_{2n-2} x^2 + ⋯ + a_0 x^{2n}.

Thus,  

s(x) = [1 + a_{2n-1} x + a_{2n-2} x^2 + ⋯ + a_0 x^{2n}] - x^{2n+2}.

But this seems to contradict our prior assertion that  

s(x) = -x^{2n+2} + a_0 x^{2n} + ⋯.

Wait, perhaps we need to be careful here.

Let me try to rewrite s(x).

Given that t(x) = p^*(x) = x^{2n} p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = 1 + a_{2n-1} x + ⋯ + a_0 x^{2n},

Therefore, \( s(x) = t(x) - x^{2n+2} = [1 + a_{2n-1} x + \cdots + a_0 x^{2n}] - x^{2n+2} \).  

\( s(x) = - x^{2n+2} + a_0 x^{2n} + [\text{lower degree terms}] \).  

So the constant term of \( s(x) \) is \( s(0) = p^{(0)} - 0 = p^{(0)} = 1 \).  

Similarly, \( m(x) \cdot h(x) \), when evaluated at \( x = 0 \), becomes  

\( m(0) \cdot h(0) = \left[ \prod_{k=1}^n (-k^2) \right] [-0 + c] = \left[ (-1)^n k_1^2 k_2^2 \cdots k_n^2 \right] c \).  

But since \( \prod_{k=1}^n k^2 = (n!)^2 \),  

\( m(0) = (-1)^n (n!)^2 \).  

Therefore, \( m(0) h(0) = (-1)^n (n!)^2 (0 + c) = (-1)^n (n!)^2 c \).  

Similarly, \( s(0) = 1 \).  

So we have:  

\( s(0) = m(0) h(0) \).  

\( 1 = (-1)^n (n!)^2 c \).  

Thus, \( c = \frac{1}{(-1)^n (n!)^2} = (-1)^n \left[ \frac{1}{(n!)^2} \right] \).  

Wait, but \( c = a_0 \).  

But we previously had \( c = a_0 \).  

Therefore, \( a_0 = (-1)^n \frac{1}{(n!)^2} \).  

Thus, we have determined \( c \).  

Similarly, perhaps we can find more about \( p^*(x) \).  

Alternatively, since \( p^*(x) - x^{2n+2} = s(x) = m(x) h(x) \),  

Given that \( m(x) = \prod_{k=1}^n (x^2 - k^2) = x^{2n} - (\text{sum of squares}) x^{2n-2} + \cdots + (-1)^n (n!)^2 \),  

Similarly, \( t(x) = p^*(x) \).  

Given \( p^*(x) = x^{2n} p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = x^{2n} \left( x^{-2n} + a_{2n-1} x^{-2n+1} + \cdots + a_0 \right) \),  

Therefore, \( p^*(x) = 1 + a_{2n-1} x + a_{2n-2} x^2 + \cdots + a_0 x^{2n} \).  

Thus, \( p^*(x) \) is degree \( 2n \).  

Similarly, \( s(x) = p^*(x) - x^{2n+2} \).  

Now, what if we consider that \( p^*(x) = x^{2n+2} - m(x) h(x) \).  

Alternatively, since \( s(x) = m(x) h(x) = [x^{2n} + \cdots + (-1)^n (n!)^2] (-x^2 + c) \),  

To find \( p^*(x) \), we can write:  

\( p^*(x) = s(x) + x^{2n+2} = [m(x) h(x)] + x^{2n+2} \).  

Thus, \( p^*(x) = [m(x) h(x)] + x^{2n+2} \).  

Then, \( p^*(x) = [m(x)(-x^2 + c)] + x^{2n+2} \).  

But \( x^{2n+2} = x^2 x^{2n} \).  

So \( p^*(x) = -m(x) x^2 + c m(x) + x^2 x^{2n} \).  

Now \( m(x) \) is monic degree \( 2n \):  

\( m(x) = x^{2n} + \cdots + (-1)^n (n!)^2 \).  

So \( x^2 m(x) = x^2 x^{2n} + \text{lower degree terms} \).  

Therefore, \( x^2 m(x) = x^{2n+2} + \text{lower degree terms} \).  

Similarly, \( x^2 x^{2n} = x^{2n+2} \).  

So \( p^*(x) = -x^2 m(x) + c m(x) + x^2 x^{2n} = [-x^2 m(x) + x^2 x^{2n}] + c m(x) \).  

But \( x^2 x^{2n} = x^{2n+2} = x^2 m_0 x^{2n} \)  

(since \( m_0 \) is the leading coefficient of \( m(x) \), which is 1).

You're right! Let me carefully rewrite the content while keeping the formatting as close as possible, adhering to your exact specifications.

Therefore,  

\(-x^2 m(x) + x^2 x^{2n} = -x^2 [m(x) - x^{2n}]\).  

But \(m(x) - x^{2n} = \text{lower degree terms}\).  

\(-x^2 m(x) + x^{2n+2} = -x^2 [m(x) - x^{2n}]\).  

Thus, \(p^*(x) = -x^2 [m(x) - x^{2n}] + c m(x)\).  

Therefore, \(p^*(x) = -x^2 [m(x) - x^{2n}] + c m(x)\).  

But \(m(x) - x^{2n} = \text{lower degree terms}\).  

Similarly, \(p^*(x) = -x^2 [\text{lower degree terms}] + c m(x)\).  

So the term of degree \(2n+1\) in \(p^*(x)\) comes from \(-x^2 [m_{2n-1} x^{2n-1}]\) plus \(c m(x)\).  

But \(p^*(x)\) has degree \(\leq 2n\).  

Therefore, the degree of \(p^*(x)\) is \(\leq 2n\).  

Similarly, the highest degree term in \(p^*(x)\) is \(x^{2n}\).  

But from our prior expression, \(p^*(x) = -x^2 [m(x) - x^{2n}] + c m(x)\).  

After simplification, the leading term is \(c x^{2n}\).  

Wait, I think this is getting too messy.  

Perhaps I should consider the concrete value of \(m(x)\) at \(x=0\).  

We already considered \(s(0) = 1\).  

Similarly, \(m(0) = (-1)^n (n!)^2\).  

Therefore, we established that \(1 = s(0) = m(0) h(0)\).  

But \(h(0) = 0 + c = c\).  

So \(c = \frac{s(0)}{m(0)} = \frac{1}{(-1)^n (n!)^2} = \frac{(-1)^n}{(n!)^2}\).  

Similarly, \(c = a_0\).  

Therefore, \(a_0 = c = \frac{(-1)^n}{(n!)^2}\).  

The constant term in \(p^*(x)\) is \(p^*(0) = 1\).  

Similarly, \(s(0) = p^*(0) - 0 = 1\).  

So consistent.  

But perhaps this is as far as we can go without specific computations.  

Alternatively, the problem is to find all real numbers \(x\) satisfying \(p(1/x) = x^2\).  

Given that \(p(1/k) = k^2\) for \(k = \pm 1, \pm 2, \dots, \pm n\),  

we might conjecture that the only real solutions are \(x = \pm (n+1), \pm (n+2), \dots\).  

But since \(p(1/x) - x^2 = 0\),  

and \(p(1/x)\) is given, perhaps all solutions \(x\) satisfy \(p(1/x) = x^2\).  

We can express \(q(x) = p(1/x) - x^2\).  

\(q(x)\) has roots at \(x = \pm 1, \pm 2, \dots, \pm n\).  

Similarly, the solutions we are looking for are zeros of \(q(x)\).  

Thus, \(q(x) = \frac{s(x)}{x^{2n}}\),  

but \(s(x) = x^{2n} q(x)\).  

Similarly, \(s(x) = m(x) h(x)\), where \(h(x) = -x^2 + c\).  

The zeros of \(q(x)\) are zeros of \(s(x)\), excluding \(x=0\).  

Thus, zeros of \(q(x)\) are \(x = \pm 1, \dots, \pm n\), and zeros of \(h(x)\).  

But \(h(x) = -x^2 + c = 0\).  

That is, \(x^2 = c\).  

Thus, \(x = \pm \sqrt{c}\).  

But \(c = \frac{(-1)^n}{(n!)^2}\).  

Therefore, \(c > 0\) when \(n\) is even, since \((-1)^n = 1\).  

Thus, \(x^2 = c\) has real solutions \(x = \pm \sqrt{c}\).  

Therefore, the other real solutions of \(p(1/x) = x^2\) are \(x = \pm \sqrt{c}\).  

Similarly, when \(n\) is even, \(c > 0\).  

Thus, the other real numbers \(x\) satisfying \(p(1/x) = x^2\) are \(x = \pm \frac{1}{n!}\).  

So in conclusion, the numbers \(x\) satisfying \(p(1/x) = x^2\) are \(x = \pm k\) for \(k = 1\) to \(n\),  

and \(x = \pm \frac{1}{n!}\).  

Thus, the answer is \(x = \pm \frac{1}{n!}\) (along with \(x = \pm k\) for \(k = 1\) to \(n\)).

To solve this problem, we need to find all real numbers \(x\) such that \(p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = x^2\), where \(p\) is a monic real polynomial of degree \(2n\), and it is given that \(p\left(\frac{1}{k}\right) = k^2\) for all integers \(k\) with \(1 \leq |k| \leq n\).

Understanding the Given Information:  

Given Data Points:  

We have \(2n\) data points from \(k = \pm1, \pm2, \dots, \pm n\), which provide the values \(p\left(\frac{1}{k}\right) = k^2\).  

Polynomial Function:  

\(p(x)\) is monic of degree \(2n\), which means its highest-degree coefficient is 1.  

Defining a New Polynomial:  

Let’s define a new function \(q(x) = p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) - x^2\).  

Our goal is to find all real solutions to \(q(x) = 0\).  

Properties of \(q(x)\):  

Since \(p\) is a polynomial of degree \(2n\), \(p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) can be expressed in powers of \(x\).  

The function \(q(x)\) has zeros at \(x = \pm1, \pm2, \dots, \pm n\) because \(q(k) = p\left(\frac{1}{k}\right) - k^2 = 0\).  

Constructing \(s(x)\):  

Consider the polynomial \(s(x) = x^{2n}q(x) = x^{2n}\left(p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) - x^2\right)\).  

Multiplying through by \(x^{2n}\) eliminates denominators, making \(s(x)\) a polynomial.  

Factoring \(s(x)\):  

We know that \(s(x)\) has roots at \(x = \pm1, \pm2, \dots, \pm n\). Therefore, \(s(x)\) can be expressed as:  

\(s(x) = m(x)h(x),\)  

where \(m(x) = \prod_{k=1}^n \left(x^2 - k^2\)\) is a monic polynomial of degree \(2n\) whose roots are \(\pm1, \pm2, \dots, \pm n\), and \(h(x)\) is a quadratic polynomial.  

Determining \(h(x)\):  

We consider \(h(x)\) to be a quadratic polynomial:  

\(h(x) = -x^2 + c,\)  

where \(c\) is a constant to be determined.  

Matching Coefficients:  

The leading term of \(s(x)\) is \(-x^{2n+2}\).  

The leading term of \(m(x)h(x)\) is \((-x^2)(x^{2n}) = -x^{2n+2}\), ensuring the degrees match.  

Comparing the constant term of \(s(x)\) using \(x = 0\):  

\(s(0) = m(0)h(0).\)  

For \(m(0)\), we have \(m(0) = (-1)^n(n!)^2.\)  

For \(h(0)\), we have \(h(0) = c.\)  

Since \(s(0) = 1,\) we find:  

\(1 = (-1)^n(n!)^2c.\)  

This gives \(c = \frac{1}{(-1)^n(n!)^2} = \frac{(-1)^n}{(n!)^2}.\)  

Finding Additional Solutions:  

Solving \(h(x) = 0\):  

\(-x^2 + c = 0 \implies x^2 = c \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{n!},\)  

since \(c = \frac{1}{(n!)^2}.\)  

Conclusion:  

The additional real numbers \(x\) satisfying \(p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = x^2\) are \boxed{\(x = \pm \frac{1}{n!}\)}
