Let \( n \) be an even positive integer.  
Let \( p \) be a monic, real polynomial of degree \( 2n \); that is to say,  

\( p(x) = x^{{2n}} + a_{2n-1}x^{2n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0 \)  

for some real coefficients \( a_0, \dots, a_{2n-1} \).  
Suppose that \( p\left(\frac{1}{k}\right) = k^2 \) for all integers \( k \) such that \( 1 \leq |k| \leq n \).  

Find all other real numbers \( x \) for which \( p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = x^2 \).
