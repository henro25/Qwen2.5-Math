Final assistant thoughts:

Let's start by analyzing the given information.

We are given a monic polynomial $p(x)$ of degree $2n$, and we know that $p\left(\frac{1}{k}\right) = k^2$ for all integers $k$ such that $1 \leq |k| \leq n$.

We want to find all other real numbers $x$ for which $p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = x^2$.

First, let's consider the values of $x$ for which $p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = x^2$.

We can rewrite this equation as $p(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}$.

Since $p(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $2n$, we know that it has at most $2n$ roots.

Let's consider the roots of $p(x) - \frac{1}{x^2}$.

We know that $p(x) - \frac{1}{x^2}$ has at least $2n$ roots, since $p(x) - \frac{1}{x^2}$ has at least $2n$ factors.

Let's consider the factors of $p(x) - \frac{1}{x^2}$.

We know that $p(x) - \frac{1}{x^2}$ has a factor of $(x - k)$ for each integer $k$ such that $1 \leq |k| \leq n$, since $p\left(\frac{1}{k}\right) = k^2$ for all integers $k$ such that $1 \leq |k| \leq n$.

We also know that $p(x) - \frac{1}{x^2}$ has a factor of $(x + k)$ for each integer $k$ such that $1 \leq |k| \leq n$, since $p\left(\frac{1}{-k}\right) = k^2$ for all integers $k$ such that $1 \leq |k| \leq n$.

Therefore, we know that $p(x) - \frac{1}{x^2}$ has at least $2n$ factors, and these factors are $(x - k)$ and $(x + k)$ for each integer $k$ such that $1 \leq |k| \leq n$.

Since $p(x) - \frac{1}{x^2}$ has at least $2n$ factors, we know that it has at least $2n$ roots.
