Final assistant thoughts:

Let \( p(x) = x^{{2n}} + a_{2n-1}x^{2n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0 \) be a monic polynomial of degree \( 2n \).

ight) = k^2 \) for all integers \( k \) such that \( 1 \leq |k| \leq n \).

This means that for each integer \( k \) in the range, we have:

ight) + a_0 = k^2 \)ots + a_1\left(rac{1}{k}

Multiplying both sides by \( k^{2n} \), we get:

\( 1 + a_{2n-1}k + \cdots + a_1k^{2n-1} + a_0k^{2n} = k^{2n+2} \)

This is a polynomial equation in \( k \) of degree \( 2n \).

Since this equation holds for all integers \( k \) in the range, we can conclude that the polynomial equation has no integer roots other than those in the range.

ight) = x^2 \).) be a real number such that \( p\left(rac{1}{x}

We can rewrite this as:

ight) + a_0 = x^2 \)ots + a_1\left(rac{1}{x}

Multiplying both sides by \( x^{2n} \), we get:

\( 1 + a_{2n-1}x + \cdots + a_1x^{2n-1} + a_0x^{2n} = x^{2n+2} \)

This is a polynomial equation in \( x \) of degree \( 2n \).

We can factor the left-hand side as:

\( (x^{2n} + a_{2n-1}x^{2n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0)(x^2 - 1) = x^{2n+2} \)

Since the left-hand side is a polynomial of degree \( 2n \), we can conclude that the right-hand side must also be a polynomial of degree \( 2n \).

However, the right-hand side is a polynomial of degree \( 2n+2 \), which is a contradiction.

ight) = x^2 \) other than those in the range \( 1 \leq |k| \leq n \).{1}{x}

In other words, the only real numbers \( x \) that satisfy the equation are those of the form \( x = \frac{1}{k} \) for some integer \( k \) in the range.

Answer:
\boxed{\frac{1}{k} \text{ for some integer } k \text{ in the range } 1 \leq |k| \leq n.}}
