Final assistant thoughts:

To find the student with the greatest average speed, we need to find the student with the smallest average time. 

The average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. 

The student with the smallest average time will be the one who traveled the greatest distance in the least amount of time.

Looking at the graph, we can see that Angela traveled the greatest distance in the least amount of time.

However, we need to calculate the exact distance and time for each student to confirm.

From the graph, we can see that:
- Angela traveled 8 units in 1.4 units of time.
- Debra traveled 6 units in 2.8 units of time.
- Briana traveled 5 units in 2.2 units of time.
- Evelyn traveled 4 units in 4.5 units of time.
- Carla traveled 4 units in 5.2 units of time.

Now, let's calculate the average speed for each student:

- Angela's average speed = total distance / total time = 8 / 1.4 = 5.71
- Debra's average speed = total distance / total time = 6 / 2.8 = 2.14
- Briana's average speed = total distance / total time = 5 / 2.2 = 2.27
- Evelyn's average speed = total distance / total time = 4 / 4.5 = 0.89
- Carla's average speed = total distance / total time = 4 / 5.2 = 0.77

The student with the greatest average speed is Angela.

\boxed{Angela}
