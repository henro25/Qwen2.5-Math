Final assistant thoughts:

To find the student with the greatest average speed, we need to find the student with the greatest distance divided by the greatest time.

The distance is on the y-axis and the time is on the x-axis.

The points on the graph are:

- Evelyn: (1.25, 4.5)
- Briana: (2.5, 2.2)
- Carla: (4.25, 5.2)
- Debra: (5.6, 2.8)
- Angela: (6.8, 1.4)

The distance for each student is the y-coordinate of the point on the graph.

- Evelyn: 4.5
- Briana: 2.2
- Carla: 5.2
- Debra: 2.8
- Angela: 1.4

The time for each student is the x-coordinate of the point on the graph.

- Evelyn: 1.25
- Briana: 2.5
- Carla: 4.25
- Debra: 5.6
- Angela: 6.8

To find the average speed, we need to divide the distance by the time.

- Evelyn: 4.5 / 1.25 = 3.6
- Briana: 2.2 / 2.5 = 0.88
- Carla: 5.2 / 4.25 = 1.22
- Debra: 2.8 / 5.6 = 0.5
- Angela: 1.4 / 6.8 = 0.2

The student with the greatest average speed is Evelyn, with an average speed of 3.6.

Answer:
\boxed{Evelyn}
