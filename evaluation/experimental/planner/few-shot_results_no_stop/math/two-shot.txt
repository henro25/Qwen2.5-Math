Final assistant thoughts:

To find the student with the greatest average speed, we need to find the student with the greatest distance divided by the greatest time.

The distance is on the y-axis and the time is on the x-axis.

The greatest distance is 6 units, which is achieved by Angela.

The greatest time is 4.5 units, which is achieved by Evelyn.

However, we need to find the student with the greatest average speed, which is the greatest distance divided by the greatest time.

The greatest distance is 6 units, which is achieved by Angela.

The greatest time is 4.5 units, which is achieved by Evelyn.

But we need to find the student with the greatest average speed, which is the greatest distance divided by the greatest time.

However, we can see that Angela has a distance of 6 units and a time of 1.4 units.

We can calculate Angela's average speed as follows:

Average speed = Distance / Time
= 6 / 1.4
= 4.29

We can also calculate the average speed of the other students as follows:

Evelyn: 4.5 / 1.25 = 3.6
Briana: 2.2 / 2.5 = 0.88
Carla: 5.2 / 4.25 = 1.22
Debra: 2.8 / 5.6 = 0.5

The student with the greatest average speed is Angela.

Answer:
\boxed{Angela}
