Let's count the letters.<br><br>Similarly, let's count the letters in \"oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx\"<br><br>Original Ciphertext:<br><br>oyfjdnisdr rtqwainr acxz mynzbhhx<br><br>Plaintext:<br><br>Think step by step<br><br>First, break down the letters:<br><br>Ciphertext letters: o y f j d n i s d r   r t q w a i n r   a c x z   m y n z b h h x<br><br>Total

word: by (2 letters)<br><br>Fourth word: step (4 letters)<br><br>Total letters in plaintext: 5 + 4 + 2 + 4 = 15 letters<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>But actually in the problem it says the example:<br><br>[Ciphertext] -> Think step by step<br><br>So is the decoding process that the ciphertext maps to \"Think step by step\"?<br><br>Our goal is to use the example above to decode:<br><br>\"oyekaijzdf aaptcg suaokybhai ouow aqht mynznvaatzacdfoulxxz\"<br><br>First, the cipher seems connected to the plaintext.<br><br>Given the time constraints, perhaps the easiest way is to try to see patterns.<br><br>Option 1: Try to find mapping from letters to letters.<br><br>Do any letters match?<br><br>First, let's write down the ciphertext and plaintext letters on top of each other.<br><br>Ciphertext:  o y f j d n i s d r   r t q w a i n r   a c x z   m y n z b h h x<br><br>Plaintext:   T h i n k   s t e p   b y   s t e p<br><br>Wait a minute.<br><br>I think maybe there is an anagram or substitution cipher here.<br><br>Alternatively, I think that we can notice that each group of ciphertext corresponds to a plaintext word.<br><br>Check the number of letters.<br><br>First ciphertext word: oyfjdnisdr (10 letters)<br><br>First plaintext word: Think (5 letters)<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>Second ciphertext word: rtqwainr (8 letters)<br><br>Second plaintext word: step (4 letters)<br><br>Third ciphertext word: acxz (4 letters)<br><br>Third plaintext word: by (2 letters)<br><br>Fourth ciphertext word: mynzbhhx (8 letters)<br><br>Fourth plaintext word: step (4 letters)<br><br>Interesting.<br><br>It seems that the ciphertext words are exactly twice as long as the plaintext words.<br><br>(10 vs 5, 8 vs 4, 4 vs 2, 8 vs 4)<br><br>Idea: Maybe we need to take every other letter or rebuild the plaintext from the ciphertext accordingly.<br><br>Let's test this theory.<br><br>If we take every other letter from the ciphertext words, maybe we'll get the plaintext.<br><br>Let's try this for the first word:<br><br>Ciphertext word: o y f j d n i s d r (10 letters)<br><br>Alternate letters:<br><br>First letters (positions 1,3,5,7,9): o f d i d<br><br>Second letters (positions 2,4,6,8,10): y j n s r<br><br>Wait: Let's try taking every second letter or first letter.<br><br>Option 1: Take the odd positions:<br><br>Positions: 1 3 5 7 9<br><br>Letters: o f d i d<br><br>Plaintext word is \"Think\", letters are T h i n k<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>Perhaps we can map letters:<br><br>o f d i d --> Think<br><br>Not directly<br><br>Option 2: Try mapping as per an assigned code: perhaps columns of letters?<br><br>Alternatively, perhaps the cipher is more complex.<br><br>Alternatively, notice that \"oyfjdnisdr\" has 10 letters and \"Think\" has 5 letters.<br><br>What if each plaintext letter is being represented by two ciphertext letters?<br><br>Similarly for other words.<br><br>Suppose that each plaintext letter corresponds to pair of letters in the ciphertext.<br><br>Meaning that the first two letters of ciphertext map to the first plaintext letter, and so on.<br><br>So for the first word, partition the ciphertext letters into pairs:<br><br>oy fj dn is dr<br><br>Corresponding to plaintext letters T h i n k<br><br>So we can attempt to map:<br><br>oy -> T<br><br>fj -> h<br><br>dn -> i<br><br>is -> n<br><br>dr -> k<br><br>If this is the mapping, perhaps each pair of letters maps to one plaintext letter.<br><br>Similarly for other words.<br><br>Let's test this mapping.<br><br>Is there a consistent mapping from pairs to letters?<br><br>Let's make a table of pairs and corresponding letters.<br><br>First, make the pairs from the first word and their corresponding plaintext letters:<br><br>Ciphertext Pairs -> Plaintext Letter<br><br>oy -> T<br><br>fj -> h<br><br>dn -> i<br><br>is -> n<br><br>dr -> k<br><br>Now, what's the mapping from \"oy\" to 'T'?<br><br>Is there a way to map 'oy' to 'T'?<br><br>Similarly for others.<br><br>One possible way is that 'oy' represents 'T'.<br><br>But how?<br><br>Option 1: Sum of the letters.<br><br>Convert letters to numbers (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26)<br><br>So let's try to get to 'T' from 'o' and 'y'<br><br>o = 15<br><br>y = 25<br><br>Sum: 15 +25 = 40<br><br>But 'T' is 20.<br><br>Alternatively, perhaps subtract: 25 -15 = 10.<br><br>No.<br><br>Alternatively, perhaps combine the numbers in some way.<br><br>Alternatively, think about their positions in the alphabet.<br><br>Alternatively, perhaps the letters are encrypted via a code.<br><br>Alternatively, perhaps if we overlay the word 'Think' over the cipher pairs 'oy', 'fj', etc., the cipher is formed by substituting each plaintext letter with two letters.<br><br>Alternatively, perhaps consider the 'original' letters.<br><br>Let's look at the letters between the word \"Think\" and \"oyfjdnisdr\"<br><br>Perhaps we can spot that \"oyfjdnisdr\" is an anagram for \"Thinkfiles\"?<br><br>But that seems unlikely.<br><br>Alternatively, think of the pairs.<br><br>Suppose we assign numbers to letters: a=1, b=2, ..., z=26<br><br>Consider the numbers in 'oy':<br><br>o = 15<br><br>y = 25<br><br>Add them: 15 + 25 = 40<br><br>Now, for 'T' we have:<br><br>'T' is number 20<br><br>What if we take the sum of the cipher pair mod 26.<br><br>15 +25 = 40<br><br>Then 40 mod 26 = 14<br><br>14 corresponds to 'N'<br><br>Doesn't match.<br><br>Alternatively, see if the cipher pairs correspond to something else.<br><br>Alternatively, perhaps the pair 'oy' corresponds to 'T' via key.<br><br>Alternatively, perhaps it's as simple as 'oy' is 'T'.<br><br>But 'o' corresponds to 'T', subtracting 'o' ASCII code from 'T'.<br><br>Now, let's think in terms of symmetric letters.<br><br>Alternatively, perhaps we can spot that the letters correspond to the first letters of words.<br><br>But perhaps an easier way is to look at the word positions.<br><br>Alternatively, perhaps we can see that the ciphertext letters are offsets from the plaintext letters.<br><br>So let's try to map the pairs to the plaintext letters.<br><br>First pair 'oy' and plaintext letter 'T'<br><br>Letter 'o' is 15, 'T' is 20<br><br>Letter 'o' + 5 = 'T' (15 +5=20)<br><br>But 'y' is 25, which is 5 letters after 'T' (20 +5=25)<br><br>Interesting, seems that 'o' +5 = 'T'<br><br>Similarly, 'y' +1 = 'Z', which is not 'T'.<br><br>Alternatively, maybe the average of the two letters corresponds to 'T'<br><br>(15 +25)/2 =20, which is 'T'<br><br>Wait a minute, that seems promising.<br><br>First pair: 'o' (15) + 'y' (25) = 40<br><br>40 /2 =20<br><br>20 corresponds to 'T'<br><br>So perhaps the average of the letters in the pair corresponds to the plaintext letter.<br><br>Let's check this with the second pair.<br><br>Second pair: 'fj' corresponding to 'h'<br><br>Letters 'f'=6, 'j'=10<br><br>Sum: 6+10=16<br><br>Average:16/2=8<br><br>8 corresponds to 'h' (since 'h' is 8)<br><br>Success!<br><br>Third pair: 'dn' to 'i'<br><br>'d'=4, 'n'=14<br><br>Sum:4+14=18<br><br>Average:18/2=9<br><br>9 corresponds to 'i'(9='i')<br><br>But 'i' is 9, so that seems off by 1.<br><br>So perhaps we need to think carefully about letters.<br><br>Wait, 18/2=9, 9 corresponds to 'I'<br><br>So this works.<br><br>Fourth pair: 'is' corresponding to 'n'<br><br>'i'=9, 's'=19<br><br>Sum:9+19=28<br><br>Average:28/2=14<br><br>14 corresponds to 'n'(14='N')<br><br>Yes!<br><br>Fifth pair: 'dr' corresponds to 'k'<br><br>'d'=4, 'r'=18<br><br>Sum:4+18=22<br><br>Average:22/2=11<br><br>11 corresponds to 'k'(11='K')<br><br>Perfect!<br><br>So our code is: For each pair, sum their numeric values, divide by 2, get the corresponding letter.<br><br>Alternatively, the average of the numeric values of the letters corresponds to the plaintext letter.<br><br>This seems to be a valid method.<br><br>Now let's test this with the other words.<br><br>Second word ciphertext: rtqwainr<br><br>Ciphertext pairs:<br><br>rt -> s<br><br>qw -> ?<br><br>ai -> ?<br><br>nr -> ?<br><br>Corresponding to plaintext letters 's', 't', 'e',
