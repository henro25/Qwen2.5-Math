 We are told that for all integer values of 
k
k satisfying 
1
≤
∣
k
∣
≤
n
1≤∣k∣≤n,

p
(
1
k
)
=
k
2
p( 
k
1
​
 )=k 
2
 

Our problem is: Given that 
p
p is monic of degree 
2
n
2n, and that 
p
(
1
k
)
=
k
2
p( 
k
1
​
 )=k 
2
  for 
k
=
±
1
,
±
2
,
…
,
±
n
k=±1,±2,…,±n, find all other real numbers 
x
x such that 
p
(
1
x
)
=
x
2
p( 
x
1
​
 )=x 
2
 .

In other words, we are to find all real numbers 
x
x such that 
p
(
1
x
)
=
x
2
p( 
x
1
​
 )=x 
2
 .

Firstly, note that:

• The monic polynomial 
p
(
x
)
p(x) is of degree 
2
n
2n.

• We have 
2
n
2n data points: for 
k
=
±
1
k=±1 to 
±
n
±n, 
p
(
1
k
)
=
k
2
p( 
k
1
​
 )=k 
2
 .

But there are 
2
n
2n distinct values of 
1
k
k
1
​
  (since 
k
k ranges over integers 
±
1
±1 to 
±
n
±n, and they are distinct).

Thus, we have 
2
n
2n points 
(
x
,
y
)
(x,y) of the form 
(
1
k
,
k
2
)
( 
k
1
​
 ,k 
2
 ).

Thus, 
p
p is a polynomial of degree 
2
n
2n that satisfies 
p
(
1
k
)
=
k
2
p( 
k
1
​
 )=k 
2
  for 
2
n
2n values of 
1
k
k
1
​
 .

Wait, but 
p
(
1
x
)
−
x
2
=
0
p( 
x
1
​
 )−x 
2
 =0.

Our equation is 
p
(
1
x
)
−
x
2
=
0
p( 
x
1
​
 )−x 
2
 =0.

Let me define 
q
(
x
)
=
p
(
1
x
)
−
x
2
q(x)=p( 
x
1
​
 )−x 
2
 .

Our task is to find all real numbers 
x
x such that 
q
(
x
)
=
0
q(x)=0.

Given the data from the problem, let’s consider that 
q
(
k
)
=
p
(
1
k
)
−
k
2
=
0
q(k)=p( 
k
1
​
 )−k 
2
 =0 for 
k
=
±
1
,
±
2
,
…
,
±
n
k=±1,±2,…,±n.

Thus, 
q
(
k
)
=
0
q(k)=0 for 
k
=
±
1
,
…
,
±
n
k=±1,…,±n.

Moreover, since 
p
p is a polynomial of degree 
2
n
2n, then 
p
(
1
x
)
p( 
x
1
​
 ) is a rational function of 
x
x of degree 
2
n
2n when considered as a function of 
x
x.

But we can consider 
q
(
x
)
=
p
(
1
x
)
−
x
2
q(x)=p( 
x
1
​
 )−x 
2
 .

Alternatively, let’s consider 
s
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
p
(
1
x
)
−
x
2
n
+
2
s(x)=x 
2n
 p( 
x
1
​
 )−x 
2n+2
 .

Let me explain: We can consider that 
p
(
1
x
)
=
x
−
2
n
+
a
2
n
−
1
x
−
2
n
+
1
+
…
+
a
0
p( 
x
1
​
 )=x 
−2n
 +a 
2n−1
​
 x 
−2n+1
 +…+a 
0
​
 .

Then multiplying by 
x
2
n
x 
2n
  gives:

x
2
n
p
(
1
x
)
=
1
+
a
2
n
−
1
x
+
a
2
n
−
2
x
2
+
…
+
a
0
x
2
n
x 
2n
 p( 
x
1
​
 )=1+a 
2n−1
​
 x+a 
2n−2
​
 x 
2
 +…+a 
0
​
 x 
2n
 .

Similarly, 
x
2
n
+
2
=
x
2
n
+
2
x 
2n+2
 =x 
2n+2
 .

Thus, define the polynomial 
s
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
p
(
1
x
)
−
x
2
n
+
2
s(x)=x 
2n
 p( 
x
1
​
 )−x 
2n+2
 .

But wait, perhaps it’s better to rearrange.

Let me consider that 
s
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
[
p
(
1
x
)
−
x
2
]
=
x
2
n
q
(
x
)
s(x)=x 
2n
 [p( 
x
1
​
 )−x 
2
 ]=x 
2n
 q(x).

So 
s
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
q
(
x
)
s(x)=x 
2n
 q(x).

Since 
q
(
k
)
=
0
q(k)=0 for 
k
=
±
1
,
…
,
±
n
k=±1,…,±n, we have 
q
(
k
)
=
0
q(k)=0.

Thus, 
s
(
k
)
=
k
2
n
q
(
k
)
=
0
s(k)=k 
2n
 q(k)=0.

Thus, 
s
(
k
)
=
0
s(k)=0 at 
x
=
±
1
,
±
2
,
…
,
±
n
x=±1,±2,…,±n.

Thus, 
s
(
x
)
s(x) is a polynomial (not a rational function), since 
x
2
n
q
(
x
)
x 
2n
 q(x) is a polynomial.

Moreover, 
s
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
[
p
(
1
x
)
−
x
2
]
=
x
2
n
p
(
1
x
)
−
x
2
n
+
2
s(x)=x 
2n
 [p( 
x
1
​
 )−x 
2
 ]=x 
2n
 p( 
x
1
​
 )−x 
2n+2
 .

But 
x
2
n
p
(
1
x
)
=
[
x
2
n
]
[
p
(
1
x
)
]
=
p
∗
(
x
)
x 
2n
 p( 
x
1
​
 )=[x 
2n
 ][p( 
x
1
​
 )]=p 
∗
 (x).

Wait, but 
x
2
n
p
(
1
x
)
x 
2n
 p( 
x
1
​
 ) is the “reciprocal polynomial” of 
p
(
x
)
p(x), evaluated at 
x
x.

But since 
p
(
x
)
p(x) is monic of degree 
2
n
2n, its reciprocal polynomial is monic of degree 
2
n
2n as well.

Thus, set 
t
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
p
(
1
x
)
t(x)=x 
2n
 p( 
x
1
​
 ).

Let me write 
t
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
p
(
1
x
)
=
P
∗
(
x
)
t(x)=x 
2n
 p( 
x
1
​
 )=P 
∗
 (x).

P
∗
(
x
)
P 
∗
 (x) is the reverse polynomial of 
p
(
x
)
p(x).

p
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
+
a
2
n
−
1
x
2
n
−
1
+
…
+
a
0
p(x)=x 
2n
 +a 
2n−1
​
 x 
2n−1
 +…+a 
0
​
 .

Then 
t
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
p
(
1
x
)
=
x
2
n
[
(
1

a

n
−
1

=

t(x)=x

 p(

​
 )=x

 +a 
2n−1
​
 ( 
x

​
 ]=1+a 
2n−1
​
 x+a 
2n−2
​
 x 
2
 +…+a 
0
​
 x 
2n
 .

So 
t
(
x
)
=
p
∗
(
x
)
t(x)=p 
∗
 (x), the reciprocal polynomial of 
p
p.

Thus, 
s
(
x
)
=
t
(
x
)
−
x
2
n
+
2
=
[
1
+
a

x

]
−
x

n
+
2
s(x)=t(x)−x 
2n+2
 =[1+a 
2n−1
​
 x+a 
2n−2
​
 x 
2
 +…+a 
0
​
 x 
2n
 ]−x 
2n+2
 .

But 
x
2
n
+
2
=
x
2
n
+
2
x 
2n+2
 =x 
2n+2
 .

Therefore, 
s
(
x
)
=
p
∗
(
x
)
−
x
2
n
+
2
s(x)=p 
∗
 (x)−x 
2n+2
 .

We can now write 
s
(
x
)
=
p
∗
(
x
)
−
x
2
n
+
2
s(x)=p 
∗
 (x)−x 
2n+2
 .

Alternatively, 
p
∗
(
x
)
−
x
2
n
+
2
=
s
(
x
)
p 
∗
 (x)−x 
2n+2
 =s(x).

But 
t
(
x
)
=
p
∗
(
x
)
t(x)=p 
∗
 (x), and 
s
(
x
)
=
t
(
x
)
−
x
2
n
+
2
s(x)=t(x)−x 
2n+2
 .

But our key is that 
s
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
q
(
x
)
s(x)=x 
2n
 q(x).

Recall that 
q
(
k
)
=
0
q(k)=0 for 
k
=
±
1
,
±
2
,
…
,
±
n
k=±1,±2,…,±n.

Therefore, 
s
(
k
)
=
0
s(k)=0 at 
x
=
±
1
,
…
,
±
n
x=±1,…,±n.

Therefore, 
s
(
x
)
s(x) is a polynomial that vanishes at 
x
=
±
1
,
±
2
,
…
,
±
n
x=±1,±2,…,±n.

s
(
x
)
s(x) has roots at 
x
=
±
1
,
…
,
±
n
x=±1,…,±n.

Thus, 
s
(
x
)
s(x) must be divisible by the monic polynomial whose roots are 
±
1
,
±
2
,
…
,
±
n
±1,±2,…,±n.

Thus, 
s
(
x
)
=
m
(
x
)
h
(
x
)
s(x)=m(x)h(x),

Where 
m
(
x
)
=
(
x
−
(
−
n
)
)
(
x
−
(
−
n
+
1
)
)
…
(
x
−
(
−
1
)
)
(
x
−
(
1
)
)
…
(
x
−
n
)
m(x)=(x−(−n))(x−(−n+1))…(x−(−1))(x−(1))…(x−n).

Wait, that is, 
m
(
x
)
=
∏
k
=
1
n
(
x
−
k
)
(
x
+
k
)
=
∏
k
=
1
n
(
x
2
−
k
2
)
m(x)=∏ 
k=1
n
​
 (x−k)(x+k)=∏ 
k=1
n
​
 (x 
2
 −k 
2
 ).

Therefore, 
m
(
x
)
=
∏
k
=
1
n
(
x
2
−
k
2
)
=
∏
k
=
1
n
(
x
2
−
k
2
)
m(x)=∏ 
k=1
n
​
 (x 
2
 −k 
2
 )=∏ 
k=1
n
​
 (x 
2
 −k 
2
 ).

Thus, 
m
(
x
)
m(x) is a monic polynomial of degree 
2
n
2n.

Similarly, since 
s
(
x
)
s(x) is of degree…

Let me compute the degree of 
s
(
x
)
s(x):

Since 
s
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
p
(
1
x
)
−
x
2
n
+
2
s(x)=x 
2n
 p( 
x
1
​
 )−x 
2n+2
 ,

Compute 
t
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
p
(
1
x
)
t(x)=x 
2n
 p( 
x
1
​
 ).

We have 
p
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
+
a
2
n
−
1
x
2
n
−
1
+
⋯
+
a
0
p(x)=x 
2n
 +a 
2n−1
​
 x 
2n−1
 +⋯+a 
0
​
 .

Then 
t
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
p
(
1
x
)
=
x
2
n
[
(
1
x
)
2
n
+
a
2
n
−
1
(
1
x
)
2
n
−
1
+
⋯
+
a
0
]
=
1
+
a
2
n
−

x
+
a
2
n
−
2
x

+
⋯
+
a
0
x
2
n
t(x)=x 
2n
 p( 
x

​
 )=x 
2n
 [( 
x

​
 ) 
2n
 +a 
2n−1
​
 ( 
x

 ) 
2n−1
 +⋯+a 
0
​
 ]=1+a 
2n−1
​
 x+a 
2n−2
​
 x 
2
 +⋯+a 
0
​
 x 
2n
 .

So 
t
(
x
)
t(x) is a polynomial of degree 
2
n
2n.

What about 
x
2
n
+
2
x 
2n+2
 ?

So 
s
(
x
)
=
t
(
x
)
−
x
2
n
+
2
s(x)=t(x)−x 
2n+2
 .

Therefore, 
s
(
x
)
s(x) is a polynomial of degree 
max
⁡
(
degree of 
t
(
x
)
,
degree of 
x
2
n
+
2
)
=
degree
(
x
2
n
+
2
)
max(degree of t(x),degree of x 
2n+2
 )=degree(x 
2n+2
 ).

So 
s
(
x
)
s(x) is of degree 
2
n
+
2
2n+2.

But 
t
(
x
)
t(x) has degree 
2
n
2n.

So 
s
(
x
)
=
[
degree 
2
n
 polynomial
]
−
degree 
(
2
n
+
2
)
 monomial
=
−
x
2
n
+
2
+
[
degree 
≤
2
n
 polynomial
]
s(x)=[degree 2n polynomial]−degree (2n+2) monomial=−x 
2n+2
 +[degree ≤2n polynomial].

So the leading term of 
s
(
x
)
s(x) is 
−
x
2
n
+
2
−x 
2n+2
 .

Thus, 
s
(
x
)
s(x) is a polynomial of degree 
2
n
+
2
2n+2 with leading coefficient 
−
1
−1.

So 
s
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
n
+
2
+
lower degree terms
s(x)=−x 
2n+2
 +lower degree terms.

Similarly, 
m
(
x
)
=
∏
k
=
1
n
(
x
2
−
k
2
)
=
monic polynomial of degree 
2
n
m(x)=∏ 
k=1
n
​
 (x 
2
 −k 
2
 )=monic polynomial of degree 2n.

Therefore, if we factor 
s
(
x
)
=
m
(
x
)
h
(
x
)
s(x)=m(x)h(x),

Since 
s
(
x
)
s(x) is degree 
2
n
+
2
2n+2 and 
m
(
x
)
m(x) is degree 
2
n
2n, 
h
(
x
)
h(x) must be degree 
2
2.

Therefore, 
h
(
x
)
h(x) is a quadratic polynomial.

Our plan is to write 
s
(
x
)
=
m
(
x
)
h
(
x
)
s(x)=m(x)h(x).

Given that 
s
(
x
)
s(x) is degree 
2
n
+
2
2n+2 with leading coefficient 
−
1
−1,

Similarly, 
m
(
x
)
m(x) is a degree 
2
n
2n monic polynomial.

Therefore, 
h
(
x
)
h(x) must be a degree 
2
2 polynomial with leading coefficient 
−
1
−1.

Therefore, 
h
(
x
)
h(x) must be of the form 
h
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
+
b
x
+
c
h(x)=−x 
2
 +bx+c.

Alternatively, since 
s
(
x
)
=
m
(
x
)
h
(
x
)
s(x)=m(x)h(x),

We can write 
s
(
x

=

−

)
x

n
+
2
+
[lower degree terms]
s(x)=(−1)x 
2n+2
 +[lower degree terms].

Also, 
m
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
+
[lower degree terms]
m(x)=x 
2n
 +[lower degree terms] (since it is monic of degree 
2
n
2n).

Similarly, 
h
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
+
b
x
+
c
h(x)=−x 
2
 +bx+c.

Then 
s
(
x
)
=
m
(
x
)
h
(
x
)
=
[
x
2
n
+
⋯
 
]
(
−
x
2
+
b
x
+
c
)
=
−
x
2
n
+
2
+
[lower degree terms]
s(x)=m(x)h(x)=[x 
2n
 +⋯](−x 
2
 +bx+c)=−x 
2n+2
 +[lower degree terms].

Therefore, the leading term of 
s
(
x
)
s(x) is 
−
x
2
n
+
2
−x 
2n+2
 , which matches.

Therefore, our assertion that 
h
(
x
)
h(x) is degree 
2
2 with leading coefficient 
−
1
−1 is consistent.

Therefore, 
h
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
+
b
x
+
c
h(x)=−x 
2
 +bx+c.

Our task now is to find 
b
b and 
c
c.

So we have:

s
(
x
)
=
m
(
x
)
h
(
x
)
=
[
∏
k
=
1
n
(
x
2
−
k
2
)
]
(
−
x
2
+
b
x
+
c
)
s(x)=m(x)h(x)=[∏ 
k=1
n
​
 (x 
2
 −k 
2
 )](−x 
2
 +bx+c)

and 
s
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
p
(
1
x
)
−
x
2
n
+
2
s(x)=x 
2n
 p( 
x
1
​
 )−x 
2n+2
 .

Equate the expressions for 
s
(
x
)
s(x).

Alternatively, let’s consider that 
t
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
p
(
1
x
)
=
p
∗
(
x
)
t(x)=x 
2n
 p( 
x
1
​
 )=p 
∗
 (x).

Then 
s
(
x
)
=
t
(
x
)
−
x
2
n
+
2
=
p
∗
(
x
)
−
x
2
n
+
2
s(x)=t(x)−x 
2n+2
 =p 
∗
 (x)−x 
2n+2
 .

Therefore, 
s
(
x
)
=
m
(
x
)
h
(
x
)
s(x)=m(x)h(x).

Thus, 
p
∗
(
x
)
−
x
2
n
+
2
=
m
(
x
)
h
(
x
)
p 
∗
 (x)−x 
2n+2
 =m(x)h(x).

But 
p
∗
(
x
)
p 
∗
 (x) is degree 
2
n
2n and 
x
2
n
+
2
x 
2n+2
  is degree 
2
n
+
2
2n+2, so their difference is degree 
2
n
+
2
2n+2.

Now, remember that 
p
∗
(
x
)
p 
∗
 (x) is degree 
≤
2
n
≤2n.

Therefore, the left-hand side 
p
∗
(
x
)
−
x
2
n
+
2
=
[
degree
≤
2
n
]
−
[
degree 
2
n
+
2
]
p 
∗
 (x)−x 
2n+2
 =[degree≤2n]−[degree 2n+2].

Wait, but the 
x
2
n
+
2
x 
2n+2
  term is of higher degree than 
p
∗
(
x
)
p 
∗
 (x), so the leading term of 
s
(
x
)
s(x) is 
−
x
2
n
+
2
−x 
2n+2
 .

Similarly, the right-hand side 
m
(
x
)
h
(
x
)
=
[
degree 
2
n
]
×
[
degree 
2
]
=
degree 
2
n
+
2
m(x)h(x)=[degree 2n]×[degree 2]=degree 2n+2.

Now, let’s write 
s
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
n
+
2
+
lower degree terms
s(x)=−x 
2n+2
 +lower degree terms.

Similarly, 
m
(
x
)
h
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
(
−
x
2
+
b
x
+
c
)
+
lower degree terms
m(x)h(x)=x 
2n
 (−x 
2
 +bx+c)+lower degree terms.

Compute 
m
(
x
)
h
(
x
)
=
(
x
2
n
+
lower degree terms
)
(
−
x
2
+
b
x
+
c
)
m(x)h(x)=(x 
2n
 +lower degree terms)(−x 
2
 +bx+c).

The product of 
x
2
n
x 
2n
  and 
−
x
2
−x 
2
  gives 
−
x
2
n
+
2
−x 
2n+2
 .

Similarly, 
x
2
n
×
b
x
=
b
x
2
n
+
1
x 
2n
 ×bx=bx 
2n+1
 ,

And 
x
2
n
×
c
=
c
x
2
n
x 
2n
 ×c=cx 
2n
 .

Thus, we find:

$s(x) = m(x) h(x) = (-x^{2n+2}) + bx^{2n+1} + c x^{2n} + \text{[lower degree terms]}$$.

Similarly, 
s
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
n
+
2
+
[lower degree terms]
s(x)=−x 
2n+2
 +[lower degree terms].

Thus, to make the higher-degree terms match, 
s
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
n
+
2
+
b
x
2
n
+
1
+
c
x
2
n
+
[lower degree terms]
s(x)=−x 
2n+2
 +bx 
2n+1
 +cx 
2n
 +[lower degree terms].

Wait, but from the definition of 
s
(
x
)
s(x), we have:

s
(
x
)
=
[
t
(
x
)
]
−
x
2
n
+
2
=
[
leading terms of 
t
(
x
)
]
−
x
2
n
+
2
s(x)=[t(x)]−x 
2n+2
 =[leading terms of t(x)]−x 
2n+2
 .

But 
t
(
x
)
=
p
∗
(
x
)
=
1
+
a
2
n
−
1
x
+
a
2
n
−
2
x
2
+
⋯
+
a
0
x
2
n
t(x)=p 
∗
 (x)=1+a 
2n−1
​
 x+a 
2n−2
​
 x 
2
 +⋯+a 
0
​
 x 
2n
 .

Thus, 
t
(
x
)
=
polynomial of degree 
≤
2
n
t(x)=polynomial of degree ≤2n.

Therefore, 
s
(
x
)
=
[
degree 
≤
2
n
]
−
x
2
n
+
2
=
−
x
2
n
+
2
+
[
degree 
≤
2
n
]
s(x)=[degree ≤2n]−x 
2n+2
 =−x 
2n+2
 +[degree ≤2n].

Therefore, the highest degree term of 
s
(
x
)
s(x) is 
−
x
2
n
+
2
−x 
2n+2
 , and the rest is lower degree terms.

Therefore, 
s
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
n
+
2
+
lower degree terms
s(x)=−x 
2n+2
 +lower degree terms.

So matching terms:

From 
m
(
x
)
h
(
x
)
m(x)h(x):

• Leading term of 
s
(
x
)
s(x): 
−
x
2
n
+
2
−x 
2n+2
 

• Second term: 
b
x
2
n
+
1
bx 
2n+1
 

• Third term: 
c
x
2
n
cx 
2n
 .

But from $$s(x) = p^(x) - x^{2n+2}
,
a
n
d
,andp^(x)
h

s
d
e
g

e
hasdegree\leq 2n$$.

Therefore, there is no 
x
2
n
+
1
x 
2n+1
  term in 
s
(
x
)
s(x) unless 
t
(
x
)
t(x) contributes, but 
t
(
x
)
t(x) is of degree 
≤
2
n
≤2n.

Given that 
s
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
n
+
2
+
[
degree
≤
2
n
]
s(x)=−x 
2n+2
 +[degree≤2n],

Therefore, 
s
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
n
+
2
+
s
2
n
x
2
n
+
s

​
 x 
2n
 +s 
2n−1
​
 x 
2n−1
 +⋯+s 
0
​
 .

Similarly, from the 
m
(
x
)
h
(
x
)
m(x)h(x) computation:

s
(
x
)
=
m
(
x
)
h
(
x
)
=
[
x
2
n
+
⋯
 
]
⋅
(
−
x

b
x

c
)
=
−
x
2
n

2
+
b
x

1
+
c
x
2
n

[lower degree terms]
s(x)=m(x)h(x)=[x 
2n
 +⋯]⋅(−x 
2
 +bx+c)=−x 
2n+2
 +bx 
2n+1
 +cx 
2n
 +[lower degree terms].

So from the above, the coefficient of 
x
2
n
+
1
x 
2n+1
  in 
s
(
x
)
s(x) is 
b
b.

But according to 
s
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
n
+
2
+
[
degree
≤
2
n
]
s(x)=−x 
2n+2
 +[degree≤2n], the 
x
2
n
+
1
x 
2n+1
  term is absent (since 
p
∗
(
x
)
p 
∗
 (x) has degree 
≤
2
n
≤2n).

Therefore, 
s
(
x
)
s(x) has no 
x
2
n
+
1
x 
2n+1
  term.

Thus, the coefficient of 
x
2
n
+
1
x 
2n+1
  in 
s
(
x
)
s(x) is zero.

Therefore, 
b
=
0
b=0.

Similarly, let’s now compare the coefficient of 
x
2
n
x 
2n
  in 
s
(
x
)
s(x), which is 
c
x
2
n
cx 
2n
 .

Similarly, from 
s
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
n
+
2
+
s
2
n
x
2
n
+
[
lower degree terms
]
s(x)=−x 
2n+2
 +s 
2n
​
 x 
2n
 +[lower degree terms],

So the coefficient of 
x
2
n
x 
2n
  in 
s
(
x
)
s(x) is 
s
2
n
=
c
s 
2n
​
 =c.

But 
s
(
x
)
=
p
∗
(
x
)
−
x
2
n
+
2
s(x)=p 
∗
 (x)−x 
2n+2
 .

So 
s
(
x
)
=
[
p
∗
(
x
)
]
−
x
2
n
+
2
s(x)=[p 
∗
 (x)]−x 
2n+2
 .

But 
p
∗
(
x
)
p 
∗
 (x) has degree 
≤
2
n
≤2n.

Therefore, the 
x
2
n
x 
2n
  term in 
s
(
x
)
s(x) is given by the 
x
2
n
x

  term in 
p
∗
(
x
)
p 
∗
 (x), which is 
a
0
x
2
n
a

​
 x

 .

So 
s

x
)
=
(
−
x

)
+
a
0
x
2
n
+
[
lower degree terms
]
s(x)=(−x 
2n+2
 )+a 
0
​
 x 
2n
 +[lower degree terms].

Therefore, comparing coefficients, the coefficient of 
x
2
n
x 
2n
  in 
s
(
x
)
s(x) is 
a
0
a 
0
​
 .

Thus, 
c
=
a
0
c=a 
0
​
 .

So 
c
=
a
0
c=a 
0
​
 .

So we have 
h
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
+
c
h(x)=−x 
2
 +c.

But we already have 
b
=
0
b=0.

Thus, 
h
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
+
c
h(x)=−x 
2
 +c.

We can now write: 
s
(
x
)
=
m
(
x
)
[
−
x
2
+
c
]
=
[
∏
k
=
1
n
(
x
2
−
k
2
)
]
(
−
x
2
+
c
)
s(x)=m(x)[−x 
2
 +c]=[∏ 
k=1
n
​
 (x 
2
 −k 
2
 )](−x 
2
 +c).

Similarly, 
s
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
n
+
2
+
a
0
x
2
n
+
[
lower degree terms
]
s(x)=−x 
2n+2
 +a 
0
​
 x 
2n
 +[lower degree terms].

We may be able to compute the expression 
m
(
x
)
[
−
x
2
+
c
]
m(x)[−x 
2
 +c] and match the coefficient of 
x
2
n
x 
2n
 .

Let me first consider 
m
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
+
[
lower degree terms
]
m(x)=x 
2n
 +[lower degree terms].

Similarly, 
m
(
x
)
⋅
(
−
x
2
+
c
)
=
−
x
2
n
+
2
+
c
x
2
n
+
[
lower degree terms
]
m(x)⋅(−x 
2
 +c)=−x 
2n+2
 +cx 
2n
 +[lower degree terms].

Therefore, 
s
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
n
+
2
+
c
x
2
n
+
[
lower degree terms
]
s(x)=−x 
2n+2
 +cx 
2n
 +[lower degree terms].

But 
s
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
n
+
2
+
a
0
x
2
n
+
[
lower degree terms
]
s(x)=−x 
2n+2
 +a 
0
​
 x 
2n
 +[lower degree terms].

Therefore, 
c
x
2
n
=
a
0
x
2
n
cx 
2n
 =a 
0
​
 x 
2n
 .

Therefore, 
c
=
a
0
c=a 
0
​
 .

Thus, 
c
=
a
0
c=a 
0
​
 .

So we’ve confirmed that 
c
=
a
0
c=a 
0
​
 .

But what about the next term? Let’s consider matching the next coefficient.

Compute 
m
(
x
)
⋅
(
−
x
2
+
c
)
=
−
x
2
n
+
2
+
c
x
2
n
+
[
lower degree terms
]
m(x)⋅(−x 
2
 +c)=−x 
2n+2
 +cx 
2n
 +[lower degree terms].

The term of degree 
x
2
n
−
2
x 
2n−2
  in 
s
(
x
)
s(x) is due to the products:

• The 
x
2
n
−
2
x 
2n−2
  term from 
m
(
x
)
m(x) multiplied by 
−
x
2
−x 
2
 

• The 
x
2
n
−
2
x 
2n−2
  term from 
m
(
x
)
m(x) multiplied by 
c
c.

Let me write 
m
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
+
m

−
2
x

n
−
2
+
lower terms
m(x)=x 
2n
 +m 
2n−2
​
 x 
2n−2
 +lower terms.

Similarly, 
m
(
x
)
⋅
(
−
x

)
=
(
−
x
2
n
+
2
+
m
2
n
−
2
x

n
+
lower terms
)
m(x)⋅(−x 
2
 )=(−x 
2n+2
 +m 
2n−2
​
 x 
2n
 +lower terms).

Wait, actually, this may not help us directly without specific terms.

An alternative is to consider the known polynomials.

So 
m
(
x
)
=
∏
k
=
1
n
(
x
2
−
k
2
)
m(x)=∏ 
k=1
n
​
 (x 
2
 −k 
2
 ).

Similarly, 
s
(
x
)
=
m
(
x
)
[
−
x
2
+
c
]
s(x)=m(x)[−x 
2
 +c].

Now, consider that 
s
(
x
)
=
[
−
x
2
n
+
2
]
+
c
x
2
n
+
[
lower degree terms
]
s(x)=[−x 
2n+2
 ]+cx 
2n
 +[lower degree terms].

Similarly, expand 
m
(
x
)
[
−
x
2
]
m(x)[−x 
2
 ] and 
m
(
x
)
⋅
c
m(x)⋅c separately.

Let me compute 
m
(
x
)
⋅
(
−
x
2
)
m(x)⋅(−x 
2
 ).

Since 
m
(
x
)
m(x) is a monic degree 
2
n
2n polynomial, its highest degree term is 
x
2
n
x 
2n
 .

Therefore, 
m
(
x
)
⋅
(
−
x
2
)
=
−
x
2
n
+
2
+
lower degree terms
m(x)⋅(−x 
2
 )=−x 
2n+2
 +lower degree terms.

Similarly, 
m
(

Therefore,

c

n
+
[

]
s(x)=[−x

Similarly, from the definition of 
s
(

)
s(x), 
s
(

)
=
[
−

 ]+s

​
 x

 +s 
2n−1
​
 x 
2n−1
 +⋯.

But from 
s
(
x
)
=
p
∗
(
x
)
−
x
2
n
+
2
s(x)=p 
∗
 (x)−x 
2n+2
 .

Since 
p
∗
(
x
)
=
1
+
a

n
−

x

a

n
−

+
a

p

2n−1
​
 x+a 
2n−2
​
 x 
2
 +⋯+a 
0
​
 x 
2n
 ,

Thus, 
s
(
x

=
[

s(x)=[1+a

 x+a

​
 x

 +⋯+a

​
 x

 ]−x

 .

But this seems to contradict our prior assertion that 
s
(
x
)
=
−
x

2
+
a

x
2
n
+
⋯
s(x)=−x 
2n+2
 +a

​
 x 
2n
 +⋯.

Wait, perhaps we need to be careful here.

Let me try to rewrite 
s
(
x
)
s(x).

Given that 
t
(
x
)
=
p
∗
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
p
(
1
x
)
=
1
+
a
2
n
−
1
x
+
⋯
+
a
0
x
2
n
t(x)=p 
∗
 (x)=x 
2n
 p( 
x
1
​
 )=1+a 
2n−1
​
 x+⋯+a 
0
​
 x 
2n
 ,

Therefore, 
s
(
x
)
=
t
(
x
)
−
x
2
n
+
2
=
[
1
+
a
2
n
−
1
x
+
⋯
+
a
0
x
2
n
]
−
x
2
n
+
2
s(x)=t(x)−x 
2n+2
 =[1+a 
2n−1
​
 x+⋯+a 
0
​
 x 
2n
 ]−x 
2n+2
 .

So 
s
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
n
+
2
+
a
0
x
2
n
+
[
lower degree terms
]
s(x)=−x 
2n+2
 +a 
0
​
 x 
2n
 +[lower degree terms].

So the constant term of 
s
(
x
)
s(x) is $$s(0) = p^(0) - 0 = p^(0) = 1$$.

Similarly, 
m
(
x
)
⋅
h
(
x
)
m(x)⋅h(x), when evaluated at 
x
=
0
x=0, becomes 
m
(
0
)
⋅
h
(
0
)
=
[
∏
k
=
1
n
(
−
k

)
]
[
−

+
c
]
=
[
(
−
1
)
n
k

k
2
2
⋯
k
n
2
]
c
m(0)⋅h(0)=[∏ 
k=1
n
​
 (−k 
2
 )][−0+c]=[(−1) 
n
 k 
1
2
​
 k 
2
2
​
 ⋯k 
n
2
​
 ]c.

But since 
k
=
1
k=1 to 
n
n, the product 
k
2
k 
2
  is

Wait, sorry, actually, 
∏
k
=
1
n
k
2
=
(
n
!
)
2
∏ 
k=1
n
​
 k 
2
 =(n!) 
2
 

So 
m
(
0
)
=
(
−
1
)
n
(
n
!
)
2
m(0)=(−1) 
n
 (n!) 
2
 .

Therefore, 
m
(
0
)
h
(
0
)
=
(
−
1
)
n
(
n
!
)
2
(
0
+
c
)
=
(
−
1
)
n
(
n

)
2
c
m(0)h(0)=(−1) 
n
 (n!) 
2
 (0+c)=(−1) 
n
 (n!) 
2
 c.

Similarly, 
s
(
0
)
=
1
s(0)=1.

So we have:

s
(
0
)
=
m
(
0
)
h
(
0
)
s(0)=m(0)h(0).

1
=
(
−
1
)
n
(
n
!
)
2
c
1=(−1) 
n
 (n!) 
2
 c.

Therefore,

c
=
1
(
−
1
)
n
(
n

)
2
=
(
−
1
)
n
[

)
2
]
=
(
−
1
)
n
[
1
(
n

)
2
]
c= 
(−1) 
n
 (n!) 
2
 
1
​
 =(−1) 
n
 [ 
(n!) 
2
 
1
​
 ]=(−1) 
n
 [ 
(n!) 
2
 
1
​
 ].

Wait, but 
c
=
a
0
c=a 
0
​
 .

But we previously had 
c
=
a
0
c=a 
0
​
 .

Therefore, 
a
0
=
(
−
1
)
n
1
(
n
!
)
2
a 
0
​
 =(−1) 
n
  
(n!) 
2
 
1
​
 .

But since 
c
=
a
0
c=a 
0
​
 ,

Thus, we have determined 
c
c.

Similarly, perhaps we can find more about 
p
∗
(
x
)
p 
∗
 (x).

But perhaps we can do better.

Alternatively, since 
p
∗
(
x
)
−
x
2
n
+
2
=
s
(
x
)
=
m
(
x
)
h
(

)
p 
∗

2n+2
 =s(x)=m(x)h(x),

Given that 
m
(
x
)
=
∏
k
=

n
(
x

−
k

)
=
x

n
−
(

)
x

n
−

⋯
+
(
−

)
n
(

)
2
m(x)=∏ 
k=1

​
 (x

 −k 
2
 )=x 
2n
 −(sum of squares)x 
2n−2
 +⋯+(−1) 
n
 (n!) 
2
 ,

Similarly, 
t
(
x
)
=
p
∗
(
x
)
t(x)=p 
∗
 (x).

Given 
p
∗
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
p
(
1
x
)
=
x
2
n
(
x
−

a
2
n

x
−

n
+

⋯
+
a
0
)
p 
∗
 (x)=x 
2n
 p( 
x

​
 )=x 
2n
 (x 
−2n
 +a 
2n−1
​
 x 
−2n+1
 +⋯+a 
0
​
 ),

Therefore, 
p
∗
(
x
)
=
1
+
a
2
n
−

2n−1
​
 x+a 
2n−2
​
 x

​
 x 
2n
 .

Thus, 
p
∗
(
x
)
p 
∗
 (x) is degree 
2
n
2n.

Similarly, 
s
(
x
)
=
p
∗
(
x
)
−
x
2
n
+
2
s(x)=p 
∗
 (x)−x 
2n+2
 .

Now, what if we consider that 
p
∗
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
+
2
−
m
(
x
)
h
(
x
)
p 
∗
 (x)=x 
2n+2
 −m(x)h(x).

Wait, but that seems messy.

Alternatively, since 
s
(
x
)
=
m
(
x
)
h
(
x
)
=
[
x
2
n
+
⋯
+
(
−

)
n
(
n
!
)
2
]
(
−
x
2
+
c
)
s(x)=m(x)h(x)=[x 
2n
 +⋯+(−1) 
n
 (n!) 
2
 ](−x 
2
 +c),

To find 
p
∗
(
x
)
p 
∗
 (x), we can write:

p
∗
(
x
)
=
s
(
x
)
+
x
2
n
+
2
=
[
m
(
x
)
h
(
x
)
]
+
x
2
n
+
2
p 
∗
 (x)=s(x)+x 
2n+2
 =[m(x)h(x)]+x 
2n+2
 .

Thus, 
p
∗
(
x
)
=
[
m
(
x
)
h
(
x
)
]
+
x
2
n
+
2
p 
∗
 (x)=[m(x)h(x)]+x 
2n+2
 .

Then, 
p
∗
(
x
)
=
[
m
(
x
)
(
−
x
2
+
c
)
]
+
x
2
n
+
2
p 
∗
 (x)=[m(x)(−x 
2
 +c)]+x 
2n+2
 .

So 
p
∗
(
x
)
=
[
m
(
x
)
(
−
x
2
+
c
)
]
+
x
2
n
+
2
p 
∗
 (x)=[m(x)(−x 
2
 +c)]+x 
2n+2
 .

But 
x
2
n
+
2
=
x
2
x
2
n
x 
2n+2
 =x 
2
 x 
2n
 .

But 
m
(
x
)
m(x) is degree 
2
n
2n, and we can write 
x
2
n
+
2
=
x
2
x
2
n
x 
2n+2
 =x 
2
 x 
2n
 .

So 
p
∗
(
x
)
=
−
m
(
x
)
x
2
+
c
m
(
x
)
+
x
2
x
2
n
p 
∗
 (x)=−m(x)x 
2
 +cm(x)+x 
2
 x 
2n
 .

But 
m
(
x
)
x
2
=
x
2
m
(
x
)
=
x
2
(
x
2
n
+
⋯
 
)
m(x)x 
2
 =x 
2
 m(x)=x 
2
 (x 
2n
 +⋯).

So let’s compute 
p
∗
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
m
(
x
)
+
c
m
(
x
)
+
x
2
n
+
2
p 
∗
 (x)=−x 
2
 m(x)+cm(x)+x 
2n+2
 .

But 
x
2
n
+
2
=
x
2
x
2
n
x 
2n+2
 =x 
2
 x 
2n
 , so:

p
∗
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
m
(
x
)
+
c
m
(
x
)
+
x
2
x
2
n
p 
∗
 (x)=−x 
2
 m(x)+cm(x)+x 
2
 x 
2n
 .

Now 
m
(
x
)
m(x) is monic degree 
2
n
2n: 
m
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
+
⋯
+
(
−
1
)
n
(
n
!
)
2
m(x)=x 
2n
 +⋯+(−1) 
n
 (n!) 
2
 .

So 
x
2
m
(
x
)
=
x
2
x
2
n
+
lower degree terms
x 
2
 m(x)=x 
2
 x 
2n
 +lower degree terms.

Therefore, 
x
2
m
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
+
2
+
lower degree terms
x 
2
 m(x)=x 
2n+2
 +lower degree terms.

Similarly, 
x
2
x
2
n
=
x
2
n
+
2
x 
2
 x 
2n
 =x 
2n+2
 .

So 
p
∗
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
m
(
x
)
+
c
m
(
x
)
+
x
2
x
2
n
=
[
−
x

x

x

n
]
+
c
m
(
x
)
p 
∗
 (x)=−x 
2
 m(x)+cm(x)+x 
2
 x 
2n
 =[−x 
2
 m(x)+x 
2
 x 
2n
 ]+cm(x).

But 
x
2
x
2
n
=
x
2
n
+
2
=
x
2
m
0
x
2
n
x 
2
 x 
2n
 =x 
2n+2
 =x 
2
 m 
0
​
 x 
2n
  (since 
m
0
m 
0
​
  is the leading coefficient of 
m
(
x
)
m(x), which is 1).

Therefore, 
−
x
2
m
(
x
)
+
x
2
x
2
n
=
−
x
2
[
m
(

)
−
x
2
n
]
−x 
2
 m(x)+x 
2
 x 
2n
 =−x 
2
 [m(x)−x 
2n
 ].

But 
m
(
x
)
−
x
2
n
=
lower degree terms
m(x)−x 
2n
 =lower degree terms.

Therefore, 
−
x
2
m
(
x
)
+
x
2
n
+
2
=
−
x
2
[
m
(
x
)
−
x
2
n
]
−x 
2
 m(x)+x 
2n+2
 =−x 
2
 [m(x)−x 
2n
 ].

Thus, 
p
∗
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
[
m
(
x
)
−
x
2
n
]
+
c
m
(
x
)
p 
∗
 (x)=−x 
2
 [m(x)−x 
2n
 ]+cm(x).

Therefore, 
p
∗
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
[
m
(
x
)
−
x
2
n
]
+
c
m
(
x
)
p 
∗
 (x)=−x 
2
 [m(x)−x 
2n
 ]+cm(x). But 
m
(
x
)
−
x
2
n
=
lower degree terms
m(x)−x 
2n
 =lower degree terms.

Similarly, 
p
∗
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
[
lower degree terms
]
+
c
m
(
x
)
p 
∗
 (x)=−x 
2
 [lower degree terms]+cm(x).

So the term of degree 
2
n
+
1
2n+1 in 
p
∗
(
x
)
p 
∗
 (x) comes from 
−
x
2
[
m
2
n
−
1
x
2
n
−
1
]
−x 
2
 [m 
2n−1
​
 x 
2n−1
 ] plus 
c
m
(
x
)
cm(x).

But 
p
∗
(
x
)
p 
∗
 (x) has degree 
≤
2
n
≤2n.

Therefore, the degree of 
p
∗
(
x
)
p 
∗
 (x) is 
≤
2
n
≤2n.

Similarly, the highest degree term in 
p
∗
(
x
)
p 
∗
 (x) is 
x
2
n
x 
2n
 .

But from our prior expression, 
p
∗
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
[
m
(
x
)
−
x
2
n
]
+
c
m
(
x
)
p 
∗
 (x)=−x 
2
 [m(x)−x 
2n
 ]+cm(x).

But after simplification, the leading term is 
c
x
2
n
cx 
2n
 .

Wait, I think this is getting too messy.

Perhaps I should consider the concrete value of 
m
(
x
)
m(x) at 
x
=
0
x=0.

We already considered

s
(
0
)
=
1
s(0)=1.

Similarly, 
m
(
0
)
=
(
−
1
)
n
(
n
!
)
2
m(0)=(−1) 
n
 (n!) 
2
 .

Therefore, we established that: 
1
=
s
(
0
)
=
m
(
0
)
h
(
0
)
1=s(0)=m(0)h(0).

But 
h
(
0
)
=
0
+
c
=
c
h(0)=0+c=c.

So 
c
=
s
(
0
)
m
(
0
)
=
1
(
−
1
)
n
(
n
!
)
2
=
(
−
1
)
n
(
n

)
2
c= 
m(0)
s(0)
​
 = 
(−1) 
n
 (n!) 
2
 
1
​
 = 
(n!) 
2
 
(−1) 
n
 
​
 .

So 
c
=
(
−
1
)
n
(
n

)
2
c= 
(n!) 
2
 
(−1) 
n
 
​
 .

Similarly, we had 
c
=
a
0
c=a 
0
​
 .

Therefore, 
a
0
=
c
=
(
−
1
)
n
(
n
!
)
2
a 
0
​
 =c= 
(n!) 
2
 
(−1) 
n
 
​
 .

Therefore, the constant term in 
p
∗
(
x
)
p 
∗
 (x) is 
p
∗
(
0
)
=
1
p 
∗
 (0)=1.

So we have 
p
∗
(
0
)
=
1
p 
∗
 (0)=1.

Similarly, 
s
(
0
)
=
p
∗
(
0
)
−
0
=
1
s(0)=p 
∗
 (0)−0=1.

So consistent.

But perhaps this is as far as we can go without specific computations.

Alternatively, the problem is to find all real numbers 
x
x satisfying 
p
(
1
x
)
=
x
2
p( 
x
1
​
 )=x 
2
 .

Given that 
p
(
1
/
k
)
=
k
2
p(1/k)=k 
2
  for 
k
=
±
1
,
±
2
,
…
,
±
n
k=±1,±2,…,±n

We might conjecture that the only real solutions are 
x
=
±
(
n
+
1
)
,
±
(
n
+
2
)
,
…
x=±(n+1),±(n+2),…

But since 
p
(
1
/
x
)
−
x
2
=
0
p(1/x)−x 
2
 =0 , and 
p
(
1
/
x
)
p(1/x) is given, perhaps all solutions 
x
x satisfy 
p
(
1
/
x
)
=
x
2
p(1/x)=x 
2
 

But we can express 
q
(
x
)
=
p
(
1
/
x
)
−
x
2
q(x)=p(1/x)−x 
2
 

But 
q
(
x
)
q(x) has roots at 
x
=
±
1
,
±
2
,
…
,
±
n
x=±1,±2,…,±n

Similarly, the solutions we are looking for are zeros of 
q
(
x
)
q(x)

Thus, 
q
(
x
)
=
s
(
x
)
x
2
n
q(x)= 
x 
2n
 
s(x)
​
 

But 
s
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
q
(
x
)
s(x)=x 
2n
 q(x)

Similarly, 
s
(
x
)
=
m
(
x
)
h
(
x
)
s(x)=m(x)h(x), where 
h
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
+
c
h(x)=−x 
2
 +c

So the zeros of 
q
(
x
)
q(x) are zeros of 
s
(
x
)
s(x) of degree 
2
n
+
2
2n+2 minus zeros at 
x
=
0
x=0 multiplicity 
2
n
2n (since 
s
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
q
(
x
)
s(x)=x 
2n
 q(x))

Therefore, zeros of 
q
(
x
)
q(x) are zeros of 
s
(
x
)
s(x), excluding 
x
=
0
x=0

Thus, zeros of 
q
(
x
)
q(x) are 
x
=
±
1
,
…
,
±
n
x=±1,…,±n, and zeros of 
h
(
x
)
h(x)

But 
h
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
+
c
=
0
h(x)=−x 
2
 +c=0

So the other zeros are solutions of 
−
x
2
+
c
=
0
−x 
2
 +c=0

So solving 
−
x
2
+
c
=
0
−x 
2
 +c=0

That is, 
x
2
=
c
x 
2
 =c

Thus, 
x
=
±
c
x=± 
c
​
 

But 
c
=
(
−
1
)
n
(
n
!
)
2
c= 
(n!) 
2
 
(−1) 
n
 
​
 

So 
c
=
(
−
1
)
n
(
n
!
)
2
c= 
(n!) 
2
 
(−1) 
n
 
​
 

Therefore, 
c
>
0
c>0 when 
n
n is even, since 
(
−
1
)
n
=
1
(−1) 
n
 =1

Therefore, when 
n
n is even, 
c
=
1
(
n
!
)
2
>
0
c= 
(n!) 
2
 
1
​
 >0

Therefore, 
c
>
0
c>0

Thus, 
x
2
=
c
x 
2
 =c has real solutions 
x
=
±
c
x=± 
c
​
 

Therefore, the other real solutions of 
p
(
1
/
x
)
=
x
2
p(1/x)=x 
2
  are 
x
=
±
c
x=± 
c
​
 

Similarly, when 
n
n is even, 
c
>
0
c>0

Thus, the other real numbers 
x
x satisfying 
p
(
1
/
x
)
=
x
2
p(1/x)=x 
2
  are 
x
=
±
c
=
±
1
n
!
x=± 
c
​
 =± 
n!
1
​
 

Therefore, the other real numbers 
x
x are 
x
=
±
1
n
!
x=± 
n!
1
​
 

Wait, wait, 
x
2
=
c
x 
2
 =c, so 
x
=
±
1
(
n

)
2
=
±
1
n
!
x=± 
(n!) 
2
 
1
​
 
​
 =± 
n!
1
​
 

Therefore, the other real numbers 
x
x are 
x
=
±
1
n
!
x=± 
n!
1
​
 

So in conclusion, the numbers 
x
x satisfying 
p
(
1
/
x
)
=
x
2
p(1/x)=x 
2
  are 
x
=
±
k
x=±k for 
k
=
1
k=1 to 
n
n, and 
x
=
±
1
n
!
x=± 
n!
1
​
 

Thus, the other real numbers 
x
x are 
±
1
n

± 
n!
1
​
 

So the answer is 
x
=
±
1
n
!
x=± 
n!
1
​
  (along with 
x
=
±
k
x=±k for 
k
=
1
k=1 to 
n
n)

Wait, but the problem says “Suppose that 
p
(
1
/
k
)
=
k
2
p(1/k)=k 
2
  for all integers 
k
k with 
1
≤

≤
n
1≤∣k∣≤n. Find all other real numbers 
x
x for which 
p
(
1
/
x
)
=
x
2
p(1/x)=x 
2
 ”

Thus, apart from 
x
=
±
k
x=±k (which have already been given), the other real numbers are 
x
=
±
1
n
!
x=± 
n!
1
​
 

Wait, but when 
n
n is even, 
c
=
(
−
1
)
n
(
n
!
)
2
=
1
(
n

)
2
c= 
(n!) 
2
 
(−1) 
n
 
​
 = 
(n!) 
2
 
1
​
 

Thus, 
c
=
1
(
n
!
)
2
c= 
(n!) 
2
 
1
​
 

Thus, 
x
2
=
c
⇒
x
=
±
1
n
!
x 
2
 =c⇒x=± 
n!
1
​
 

Thus, the other real numbers are 
x
=
±
1
n
!
x=± 
n!

​
 

Answer: The other real numbers 
x
x satisfying 
p
(

/
x
)
=
x

p(1/x)=x 
2
  are 
x
=

x=±

​
 

To solve this problem, we need to find all real numbers 
x
x such that

p
(
1
x
)
=
x
2
,
p( 
x
1
​
 )=x 
2
 ,

where 
p
p is a monic real polynomial of degree 
2
n
2n, and it is given that

p
(
1
k
)
=
k
2
p( 
k
1
​
 )=k 
2
 

for all integers 
k
k with 
1
≤
∣
k
∣
≤
n
1≤∣k∣≤n.

Understanding the Given Information:

Given Data Points: We have 
2
n
2n data points from 
k
=
±
1
,
±
2
,
…
,
±
n
k=±1,±2,…,±n, which provide the values 
p
(
1
k
)
=
k
2
p( 
k
1
​
 )=k 
2
 .

Polynomial Function: 
p
(
x
)
p(x) is monic of degree 
2
n
2n, which means its highest-degree coefficient is 1.

Defining a New Polynomial:

Let’s define a new function

q
(
x
)
=
p
(
1
x
)
−
x
2
.
q(x)=p( 
x
1
​
 )−x 
2
 .

Our goal is to find all real solutions to 
q
(
x
)
=
0
q(x)=0.

Properties of 
q
(
x
)
q(x):

Since 
p
p is a polynomial of degree 
2
n
2n, 
p
(
1
x
)
p( 
x
1
​
 ) can be expressed in powers of 
x
x.

The function 
q
(
x
)
q(x) has zeros at 
x
=
±
1
,
±
2
,
…
,
±
n
x=±1,±2,…,±n because 
q
(
k
)
=
p
(
1
k
)
−
k
2
=
0
q(k)=p( 
k
1
​
 )−k 
2
 =0.

Constructing 
s
(
x
)
s(x):

Consider the polynomial

s
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
q
(
x
)
=
x
2
n
(
p
(
1
x
)
−
x
2
)
.
s(x)=x 
2n
 q(x)=x 
2n
 (p( 
x
1
​
 )−x 
2
 ).

Multiplying through by 
x
2
n
x 
2n
  eliminates denominators, making 
s
(
x
)
s(x) a polynomial.

Factoring 
s
(
x
)
s(x):

We know that 
s
(
x
)
s(x) has roots at 
x
=
±
1
,
±
2
,
…
,
±
n
x=±1,±2,…,±n. Therefore, 
s
(
x
)
s(x) can be expressed as:

s
(
x
)
=
m
(
x
)
h
(
x
)
,
s(x)=m(x)h(x),

where 
m
(
x
)
=
∏
k
=
1
n
(
x
2
−
k
2
)
m(x)=∏ 
k=1
n
​
 (x 
2
 −k 
2
 ) is a monic polynomial of degree 
2
n
2n whose roots are 
±
1
,
±
2
,
…
,
±
n
±1,±2,…,±n, and 
h
(
x
)
h(x) is a quadratic polynomial.

Determining 
h
(
x
)
h(x):

We consider 
h
(
x
)
h(x) to be a quadratic polynomial:

h
(
x
)
=
−
x
2
+
c
,
h(x)=−x 
2
 +c,

where 
c
c is a constant to be determined.

Matching Coefficients:

The leading term of 
s
(
x
)
s(x) is 
−
x
2
n
+
2
−x 
2n+2
 .

The leading term of 
m
(
x
)
h
(
x
)
m(x)h(x) is 
(
x
2
n
)
(
−
x
2
)
=
−
x
2
n
+
2
(x 
2n
 )(−x 
2
 )=−x 
2n+2
 , ensuring the degrees match.

Comparing the constant term of 
s
(
x
)
s(x) using 
x
=
0
x=0:

$$ s(0) = p^(0) - 0 = 1 
,
w
h
e
r
e
,where p^(x) = x^{2n} p\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) $$.

Evaluating 
m
(
0
)
m(0) and 
h
(
0
)
h(0):

m
(
0
)
=
(
−
1
)
n
(
n
!
)
2
m(0)=(−1) 
n
 (n!) 
2
 .

h
(
0
)
=
−
0
+
c
=
c
h(0)=−0+c=c.

Since 
s
(
0
)
=
m
(
0
)
h
(
0
)
s(0)=m(0)h(0):

1
=

n
(

)
2
c

1=(−1) 
n

 c,

which gives:

c

(

)
n
(

)
2
=
(

n

c= 
(−1) 
n
 (n!)

​
 = 
(n!)

(−1)

 .

For 
n
n even (since 
n
n is even), 
(
−

)
n
=
1
(−1) 
n
 =1, so 
c

c>0.

Finding Additional Solutions:

Solving 
h

h(x)=0:

−

⟹
