Problem: We are allowed to remove exactly one integer from the list $$-1,0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,11,$$and then we choose two distinct integers at random from the remaining list.  What number should we remove if we wish to maximize the probability that the sum of the two chosen numbers is 10?
