Reasoning: 
So i've got this problem here: for which positive integer values of 
k
k does the quadratic equation 
k
x
2
+
20
x
+
k
=
0
kx 
2
 +20x+k=0 have rational solutions? i need to find all such 
k
k and list them in increasing order, separated by commas. okay, let's dive in.

first off, i remember that for a quadratic equation of the form 
a
x
2
+
b
x
+
c
=
0
ax 
2
 +bx+c=0, the solutions are given by the quadratic formula:

x
=
−
b
±
b
2
−
4
a
c
2
a
x= 
2a
−b± 
b 
2
 −4ac
​
 
​
 
for the solutions to be rational, the discriminant 
d
=
b
2
−
4
a
c
d=b 
2
 −4ac needs to be a perfect square. because if the discriminant is a perfect square, then its square root is rational, and since all the other parts of the formula are rational (assuming 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c are integers), the entire expression for 
x
x will be rational.

so, in this case, 
a
=
k
a=k, 
b
=
20
b=20, and 
c
=
k
c=k. plugging these into the discriminant formula:

d
=
(
20
)
2
−
4
⋅
k
⋅
k
=
400
−
4
k
2
d=(20) 
2
 −4⋅k⋅k=400−4k 
2
 
we need 
d
d to be a perfect square. let's denote 
d
=
m
2
d=m 
2
 , where 
m
m is an integer. so:

400
−
4
k
2
=
m
2
400−4k 
2
 =m 
2
 
let me rearrange this equation to make it easier to work with:

4
k
2
+
m
2
=
400
4k 
2
 +m 
2
 =400
hmm, this looks like an equation involving squares. maybe i can think of this as finding integer solutions 
(
k
,
m
)
(k,m) to this equation, with 
k
k being a positive integer.

wait a minute, since 
k
k is positive and 
m
2
m 
2
  is non-negative, both 
4
k
2
4k 
2
  and 
m
2
m 
2
  are non-negative, and their sum is 400. so, i need to find all positive integer values of 
k
k such that 
4
k
2
4k 
2
  is less than or equal to 400, and 
400
−
4
k
2
400−4k 
2
  is a perfect square.

let me think about possible values of 
k
k. since 
k
k is a positive integer, let's see what values 
k
k can take.

first, find the maximum possible 
k
k:

4
k
2
≤
400
  
⟹
  
k
2
≤
100
  
⟹
  
k
≤
10
4k 
2
 ≤400⟹k 
2
 ≤100⟹k≤10
so, 
k
k can be any integer from 1 to 10.

now, for each 
k
k from 1 to 10, i can compute 
d
=
400
−
4
k
2
d=400−4k 
2
  and check if 
d
d is a perfect square.

let me make a table:

is d a perfect square?
is 396 a perfect square?
is 384 a perfect square?
is 364 a perfect square?
is 336 a perfect square?
is 300 a perfect square?
is 256 a perfect square?

is 76 a perfect square?
is 0 a perfect square?
​
 
​
 
now, let's check each 
d
d:

1. 
d
=
396
d=396: the square of 19 is 361, and 20 squared is 400. so, 396 is not a perfect square.

2. 
d
=
384
d=384: 19 squared is 361, 20 squared is 400. not a perfect square.

3. 
d
=
364
d=364: between 19^2 and 20^2 again. not a perfect square.

4. 
d
=
336
d=336: 18^2 = 324, 19^2 = 361. not a perfect square.

5. 
d
=
300
d=300: 17^2 = 289, 18^2 = 324. not a perfect square.

6. 
d
=
256
d=256: 16^2 = 256. yes, perfect square.

7. 
d
=
204
d=204: 14^2 = 196, 15^2 = 225. not a perfect square.

8. 
d
=
144
d=144: 12^2 = 144. yes, perfect square.

9. 
d
=
76
d=76: 8^2 = 64, 9^2 = 81. not a perfect square.

10. 
d
=
0
d=0: 0 is a perfect square (0^2 = 0).

so, from the table, 
d
d is a perfect square for 
k
=
6
,
8
,
10
k=6,8,10.

therefore, the positive integer values of 
k
k that make the quadratic equation 
k
x
2
+
20
x
+
k
=
0
kx 
2
 +20x+k=0 have rational solutions are 6, 8, and 10.

wait a minute, i should double-check if 
k
=
10
k=10 is acceptable. plugging back into the original equation:

10
x
2
+
20
x
+
10
=
0
10x 
2
 +20x+10=0

we can simplify this by dividing all terms by 10:

x
2
+
2
x
+
1
=
0
x 
2
 +2x+1=0

this factors as 
(
x
+
1
)
2
=
0
(x+1) 
2
 =0, so 
x
=
−
1
x=−1, which is rational. so, it checks out.

similarly, for 
k
=
6
k=6:

6
x
2
+
20
x
+
6
=
0
6x 
2
 +20x+6=0

the discriminant is 
d
=
400
−
4
(
6
)
2
=
400
−
144
=
256
=
1
6
2
d=400−4(6) 
2
 =400−144=256=16 
2
 , which is a perfect square, so rational solutions.

for 
k
=
8
k=8:

8
x
2
+
20
x
+
8
=
0
8x 
2
 +20x+8=0

d
=
400
−
4
(
8
)
2
=
400
−
256
=
144
=
1
2
2
d=400−4(8) 
2
 =400−256=144=12 
2
 , again a perfect square.

alright, so these are the only values where 
d
d is a perfect square within the range of 
k
=
1
k=1 to 
10
10. therefore, the positive integer values of 
k
k are 6, 8, and 10.

**final answer**
