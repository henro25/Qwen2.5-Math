Reasoning: So i have this problem here: "three faces of a right rectangular prism have areas of 48, 49, and 50 square units. what is the volume of the prism, in cubic units? express your answer to the nearest whole number."

alright, let's break this down. a right rectangular prism is basically a box shape, with all angles being right angles. it has three dimensions: length, width, and height. the areas of the three different faces would correspond to the areas of the sides, front, and top of the box, or something like that.

so, let's denote the length as 
l
l, the width as 
w
w, and the height as 
h
h. the areas of the three faces would then be:

- one face: 
l
×
w
=
48
l×w=48

- another face: 
l
×
h
=
49
l×h=49

- the third face: 
w
×
h
=
50
w×h=50

and we need to find the volume, which is 
v
=
l
×
w
×
h
v=l×w×h.

hmm, so i have three equations with three variables. maybe i can solve for one variable in terms of the others and substitute.

let's see, from the first equation:

l
×
w
=
48
l×w=48 → 
l
=
48
w
l= 
w
48
​
 

now, plug this into the second equation:

48
w
×
h
=
49
w
48
​
 ×h=49 → 
h
=
49
w
48
h= 
48
49w
​
 

now, plug both 
l
l and 
h
h into the third equation:

w
×
49
w
48
=
50
w× 
48
49w
​
 =50

simplify that:

49
w
2
48
=
50
48
49w 
2
 
​
 =50

now, solve for 
w
2
w 
2
 :

w
2
=
50
×
48
49
w 
2
 = 
49
50×48
​
 

calculate that:

w
2
=
2400
49
w 
2
 = 
49
2400
​
 

so, 
w
=
2400
49
w= 
49
2400
​
 
​
 

which simplifies to:

w
=
2400
7
w= 
7
2400
​
 
​
 

now, 
2400
=
16
×
150
=
4
150
2400
​
 = 
16×150
​
 =4 
150
​
 

and 
150
=
25
×
6
=
5
6
150
​
 = 
25×6
​
 =5 
6
​
 

so, 
w
=
4
×
5
6
7
=
20
6
7
w= 
7
4×5 
6
​
 
​
 = 
7
20 
6
​
 
​
 

okay, that's 
w
w. now, let's find 
l
l and 
h
h in terms of 
w
w.

we already have 
l
=
48
w
=
48

=

6
l= 
w
48
​
 = 
7
20 
6
​
 
​
 
48
​
 = 
20 
6
​
 
48×7
​
 = 
20 
6
​
 
336
​
 = 
5 
6
​
 
84
​
 

similarly, 
h
=
49
w
48
=
49
×
20
6

48
=
140

h=

​
 
​
 =

140 
6
​
 
​
 =

6
​
 
​
 

now, the volume 
v
=
l
×
w
×
h
=
84

84
​
 × 
7
20 
6
​
 
​
 × 
12
35 
6
​
 
​
 

let's multiply these fractions step by step.

first, 
84
5
6
×
20

=

20 
6
​
 
​
 = 
5×7× 
6
​
 
84×20× 
6
​
 
​
 

wait, the 
6
6
​
  in the numerator and denominator cancel out:

84
×
20
5
×
7
=
1680
35
=
48
5×7
84×20
​
 = 
35
1680
​
 =48

now, multiply by 
35
6
12
12
35 
6
​
 
​
 :

48
×
35
6
12
=

=
140
6
48× 
12
35 
6
​
 
​
 =4×35 
6
​
 =140 
6
​
 

so, 
v
=
140
6
v=140 
6
​
 

now, to get this to a numerical value, i need to approximate 
6
6
​
 .

6
6
​
  is approximately 2.449.

so, 
v
≈
140
×
2.449
=
140
×
2
+
140
×
0.449
=
280
+
62.86
=
342.86
v≈140×2.449=140×2+140×0.449=280+62.86=342.86

rounding to the nearest whole number, the volume is approximately 343 cubic units.

wait a minute, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

first, from 
l
×
w
=
48
l×w=48, 
l
=
48
/
w
l=48/w

then, 
l
×
h
=
49
l×h=49, so 
h
=
49
/
l
=
49
/
(
48
/
w
)
=
49
w
/
48
h=49/l=49/(48/w)=49w/48. that seems correct.

then, 
w
×
h
=
50
w×h=50, so 
w
×
(
49
w
/
48
)
=
50
w×(49w/48)=50 → 
49
w
2
/
48
=
50
49w 
2
 /48=50 → 
w
2
=
(
50
×
48
)
/
49
w 
2
 =(50×48)/49 → 
w
2
=
2400
/
49
w 
2
 =2400/49 → 
w
=
2400
/
7

 /7=

​
 /7=4 
150
​
 /7=4×5 
6
​
 /7=20

​
 /7. that seems correct.

then, 
l
=
48
/
w
=

(

)
=

l=48/w=48/(20

​
 /7)=48×7/(20 
6
​
 )=336/(20 
6
​
 )=84/(5 
6
​
 ). correct.

then, 
h
=
49
w
/
48
=
49

(
20

/

)
/
48

h=49w/48=49×(20

​
 /7)/48=(49×20 
6
​
 )/(7×48)=(980 
6
​
 )/(336)=(35

​
 )/12. correct.

now, volume 
v
=
l
×
w
×
h
=
(
84
/
(
5

)
)
×
(
20

×
(
35

)
v=l×w×h=(84/(5 
6
​
 ))×(20 
6
​
 /7)×(35 
6
​
 /12)

first, 
(
84
/
(
5

)
)
×
(
20

/
7
)
=
(
84

(

)
=

=
48
(84/(5

​
 /7)=(84×20

​
 )/(5×7× 
6
​
 ))=(1680 
6
​
 )/(35 
6
​
 ))=1680/35=48

then, 
48
×
(
35
6
/
12
)
=
(
48

35
6
)
/
12
=

12
=
140

48×(35 
6
​
 /12)=(48×35 
6
​
 )/12=(1680 
6
​
 )/12=140 
6
​
 

so, 
v
=
140
6
v=140 
6
​
 , and 
6
≈
2.449
6
​
 ≈2.449, so 
v
≈
140
×
2.449
=
342.86
v≈140×2.449=342.86, which rounds to 343.

alternatively, perhaps there is a better way to calculate this without getting into such messy algebra.

let me try another approach.

we have:

l
×
w
=
48
l×w=48 (1)

l
×
h
=
49
l×h=49 (2)

w
×
h
=
50
w×h=50 (3)

if i multiply all three equations together:

(
l
×
w
)
×
(
l
×
h
)
×
(
w
×
h
)
=
48
×
49
×
50
(l×w)×(l×h)×(w×h)=48×49×50

which is:

l
2
×
w
2
×
h
2
=
48
×
49
×
50
l 
2
 ×w 
2
 ×h 
2
 =48×49×50

taking square roots:

l
×
w
×
h
=
48
×
49
×
50
l×w×h= 
48×49×50
​
 

so, 
v
=
48
×
49
×
50
v= 
48×49×50
​
 

let's compute that.

first, 
48
×
49
=
2352
48×49=2352

then, 
2352
×
50
=
117600
2352×50=117600

so, 
v
=
117600
v= 
117600
​
 

now, 
117600
=
1176
×
100
=
1176
×
10
=
10
×
1176
117600
​
 = 
1176×100
​
 = 
1176
​
 ×10=10× 
1176
​
 

now, 
1176
=
49
×
24
1176=49×24, since 49 times 24 is 1176.

so, 
1176
=
49
×
24
=
7
24
1176
​
 = 
49×24
​
 =7 
24
​
 

and 
24
=
2
6
24
​
 =2 
6
​
 , so 
1176
=
7
×
2
6
=
14
6
1176
​
 =7×2 
6
​
 =14 
6
​
 

therefore, 
v
=
10
×
14
6
=
140
6
v=10×14 
6
​
 =140 
6
​
 , which matches what i got earlier.

so, 
v
=
140
6
v=140 
6
​
 , and 
6
≈
2.449
6
​
 ≈2.449, so 
v
≈
140
×
2.449
=
342.86
v≈140×2.449=342.86, which rounds to 343.

alternatively, i can use a calculator to find a more precise value of 
6
6
​
 .

6
≈
2.449489743
6
​
 ≈2.449489743

so, 
v
=
140
×
2.449489743
=
140
×
2
+
140
×
0.449489743
=
280
+
62.9285642
=
342.9285642
v=140×2.449489743=140×2+140×0.449489743=280+62.9285642=342.9285642

rounding to the nearest whole number, that's 343.

alternatively, if i want to be even more precise:

140
×
2.449489743
=
342.9285642
140×2.449489743=342.9285642, which is 342.9285642, so indeed, 343 when rounded to the nearest whole number.

therefore, the volume of the prism is approximately 343 cubic units.

**final answer**
