Reasoning: So i've got this math problem to solve: calculate 
[
(
1
2
12
÷
1
2
11
)
2
⋅
4
2
]
÷
2
4
[(12 
12
 ÷12 
11
 ) 
2
 ⋅4 
2
 ]÷2 
4
 . hmm, seems a bit complicated at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.

first, i need to simplify the expression inside the brackets: 
(
1
2
12
÷
1
2
11
)
2
⋅
4
2
(12 
12
 ÷12 
11
 ) 
2
 ⋅4 
2
 . i know that when you divide two exponents with the same base, you subtract the exponents. so, 
1
2
12
÷
1
2
11
12 
12
 ÷12 
11
  should be 
1
2
12
−
11
12 
12−11
 , which is 
1
2
1
12 
1
  or just 12.

so, now the expression simplifies to 
(
12
)
2
⋅
4
2
(12) 
2
 ⋅4 
2
 . i can calculate 
1
2
2
12 
2
  which is 144, and 
4
2
4 
2
  which is 16. multiplying those together gives 
144
×
16
144×16. let me calculate that: 144 times 16. well, 144 times 10 is 1440, and 144 times 6 is 864, so adding those together gives 1440 + 864 = 2304.

so now, the expression inside the brackets is 2304, and i need to divide that by 
2
4
2 
4
 . 
2
4
2 
4
  is 16. so, 2304 divided by 16. let's do that division. 16 times 144 is 2304, so the answer should be 144.

wait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe i should double-check my steps to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

starting over: 
(
1
2
12
÷
1
2
11
)
2
⋅
4
2
(12 
12
 ÷12 
11
 ) 
2
 ⋅4 
2
  divided by 
2
4
2 
4
 .

first, simplify 
1
2
12
÷
1
2
11
12 
12
 ÷12 
11
 . using the exponent division rule: 
a
m
÷
a
n
=
a
m
−
n
a 
m
 ÷a 
n
 =a 
m−n
 , so that's 
1
2
12
−
11
=
1
2
1
=
12
12 
12−11
 =12 
1
 =12. that seems correct.

then, raise that to the power of 2: 
1
2
2
=
144
12 
2
 =144. also correct.

next, multiply by 
4
2
4 
2
 : 
4
2
=
16
4 
2
 =16, and 
144
×
16
=
2304
144×16=2304. that matches what i got earlier.

finally, divide by 
2
4
2 
4
 : 
2
4
=
16
2 
4
 =16, and 
2304
÷
16
=
144
2304÷16=144. so, the final answer is 144.

wait, but maybe there's a smarter way to simplify this expression without having to calculate such large numbers like 12^12 and 12^11. perhaps i can simplify the exponents first before doing any multiplication or division.

let me try that approach.

original expression: 
[
(
1
2
12
÷
1
2
11
)
2
⋅
4
2
]
÷
2
4
[(12 
12
 ÷12 
11
 ) 
2
 ⋅4 
2
 ]÷2 
4
 

first, simplify 
1
2
12
÷
1
2
11
=
1
2
1
=
12
12 
12
 ÷12 
11
 =12 
1
 =12, as before.

now, the expression is 
(
12
)
2
⋅
4
2
(12) 
2
 ⋅4 
2
  divided by 
2
4
2 
4
 .

i know that 
4
4 is 
2
2
2 
2
 , so 
4
2
=
(
2
2
)
2
=
2
4
4 
2
 =(2 
2
 ) 
2
 =2 
4
 . so, the expression becomes 
1
2
2
⋅
2
4
12 
2
 ⋅2 
4
  divided by 
2
4
2 
4
 .

when you divide like bases with exponents, you subtract the exponents: 
2
4
÷
2
4
=
2
0
=
1
2 
4
 ÷2 
4
 =2 
0
 =1. so, it's 
1
2
2
×
1
=
144
12 
2
 ×1=144.

that's another way to see that the answer is 144, without having to multiply large numbers.

alternatively, i could look at the entire expression and see if there's a way to simplify it using exponent rules.

let's see: 
[
(
1
2
12
÷
1
2
11
)
2
⋅
4
2
]
÷
2
4
[(12 
12
 ÷12 
11
 ) 
2
 ⋅4 
2
 ]÷2 
4
 

first, simplify inside the brackets: 
1
2
12
÷
1
2
11
=
1
2
1
12 
12
 ÷12 
11
 =12 
1
 , so we have 
(
12
)
2
⋅
4
2
(12) 
2
 ⋅4 
2
 , which is 
144
×
16
144×16, as i did before.

but since 
4
=
2
2
4=2 
2
 , then 
4
2
=
(
2
2
)
2
=
2
4
4 
2
 =(2 
2
 ) 
2
 =2 
4
 , so the expression is 
1
2
2
×
2
4
12 
2
 ×2 
4
 , and then divided by 
2
4
2 
4
 , which cancels out the 
2
4
2 
4
 , leaving 
1
2
2
=
144
12 
2
 =144.

i keep getting 144, which makes me more confident that that's the correct answer.

maybe i can try expressing everything in terms of prime factors to see if that confirms the answer.

first, factorize the numbers involved:

12 can be factored into 
2
2
×
3
2 
2
 ×3, and 4 is 
2
2
2 
2
 .

so, let's rewrite the original expression with these prime factors.

original expression: 
[
(
1
2
12
÷
1
2
11
)
2
⋅
4
2
]
÷
2
4
[(12 
12
 ÷12 
11
 ) 
2
 ⋅4 
2
 ]÷2 
4
 

first, simplify 
1
2
12
÷
1
2
11
=
1
2
1
=
12
=
2
2
×
3
12 
12
 ÷12 
11
 =12 
1
 =12=2 
2
 ×3

so, the expression becomes 
[
(
2
2
×
3
)
2
⋅
(
2
2
)
2
]
÷
2
4
[(2 
2
 ×3) 
2
 ⋅(2 
2
 ) 
2
 ]÷2 
4
 

now, expand the exponents:

(
2
2
)
2
=
2
4
(2 
2
 ) 
2
 =2 
4
  and 
3
2
=
3
2
3 
2
 =3 
2
 , and 
(
2
2
)
2
=
2
4
(2 
2
 ) 
2
 =2 
4
 

so, it's 
[
2
4
×
3
2
⋅
2
4
]
÷
2
4
[2 
4
 ×3 
2
 ⋅2 
4
 ]÷2 
4
 

combine like terms in the numerator: 
2
4
×
2
4
=
2
8
2 
4
 ×2 
4
 =2 
8
 , so now it's 
[
2
8
×
3
2
]
÷
2
4
[2 
8
 ×3 
2
 ]÷2 
4
 

now, divide 
2
8
÷
2
4
=
2
4
2 
8
 ÷2 
4
 =2 
4
 , so the expression is 
2
4
×
3
2
2 
4
 ×3 
2
 

calculate the values: 
2
4
=
16
2 
4
 =16 and 
3
2
=
9
3 
2
 =9, so 
16
×
9
=
144
16×9=144

again, i arrive at 144. this reinforces that the answer is indeed 144.

alternatively, i could use logarithms or other exponent rules, but given that all these methods lead to the same answer, i think it's safe to conclude that 144 is the correct result.

just to make sure, maybe i can plug in the numbers into a calculator to verify.

first, calculate 
1
2
12
12 
12
 : that's a very large number, 8916100448256.

then, 
1
2
11
12 
11
 : 743008370688.

now, divide them: 
8916100448256
÷
743008370688
=
12
8916100448256÷743008370688=12, as expected.

then, 
1
2
2
=
144
12 
2
 =144, and 
4
2
=
16
4 
2
 =16, so 
144
×
16
=
2304
144×16=2304.

finally, 
2
4
=
16
2 
4
 =16, and 
2304
÷
16
=
144
2304÷16=144.

yes, that checks out.

alternatively, if i consider that 
12
=
3
×
4
12=3×4, and 
4
=
2
2
4=2 
2
 , so 
12
=
3
×
2
2
12=3×2 
2
 , maybe there's a way to simplify using that, but i think i've already covered that in the prime factorization approach.

in summary, multiple methods lead to the same answer of 144, so i'm confident that's the correct solution.

**final answer**

144
