Problem: Inside a square with side length 10, two congruent equilateral triangles are drawn such that they share one side and each has one vertex on a vertex of the square.  What is the side length of the largest square that can be inscribed in the space inside the square and outside of the triangles?

size(100);
pair A, B, C, D, E, F;
B=(0,0); A=(0,10); D=(10,10); C=(10,0);
real x = 5 -5/sqrt(3);
pair E = (x,x); pair F = (10-x, 10-x);
draw(A--B--C--D--cycle);
draw(A--E--C--F--cycle); draw(E--F);
