Reasoning: So i need to find the inverse of 34 modulo 47, and i'm given that the inverse of 13 modulo 47 is 29. that is, 
1
3
−
1
≡
29
(
m
o
d
47
)
13 
−1
 ≡29(mod47). okay, let's see how to use this information to find 
3
4
−
1
(
m
o
d
47
)
34 
−1
 (mod47).

first, i should recall what it means for a number to have an inverse modulo another number. the inverse of a number 
a
a modulo 
m
m is a number 
b
b such that 
a
×
b
≡
1
(
m
o
d
m
)
a×b≡1(modm). so, i need to find a number 
x
x such that 
34
×
x
≡
1
(
m
o
d
47
)
34×x≡1(mod47).

one way to find the inverse is to use the extended euclidean algorithm, which finds integers 
x
x and 
y
y such that 
a
×
x
+
m
×
y
=
gcd
⁡
(
a
,
m
)
a×x+m×y=gcd(a,m). since 34 and 47 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), there should be an inverse.

but i already know the inverse of 13 modulo 47 is 29. maybe there's a relationship between 13 and 34 that i can exploit. let's see, 34 is related to 13 in some way. hmm, 34 is actually equal to -13 modulo 47 because 
34
+
13
=
47
34+13=47, and 
47
≡
0
(
m
o
d
47
)
47≡0(mod47). so, 
34
≡
−
13
(
m
o
d
47
)
34≡−13(mod47).

if 
34
≡
−
13
(
m
o
d
47
)
34≡−13(mod47), then 
3
4
−
1
≡
(
−
13
)
−
1
(
m
o
d
47
)
34 
−1
 ≡(−13) 
−1
 (mod47). now, what is the inverse of 
−
13
−13 modulo 47? well, the inverse of 
−
a
−a is 
−
a
−
1
−a 
−1
 , because 
(
−
a
)
×
(
−
a
−
1
)
=
a
×
a
−
1
=
1
(−a)×(−a 
−1
 )=a×a 
−1
 =1. so, 
(
−
13
)
−
1
≡
−
(
1
3
−
1
)
(
m
o
d
47
)
(−13) 
−1
 ≡−(13 
−1
 )(mod47).

given that 
1
3
−
1
≡
29
(
m
o
d
47
)
13 
−1
 ≡29(mod47), then 
(
−
13
)
−
1
≡
−
29
(
m
o
d
47
)
(−13) 
−1
 ≡−29(mod47). but 
−
29
−29 modulo 47 is the same as 
47
−
29
=
18
47−29=18, because adding 47 doesn't change the equivalence class.

therefore, 
3
4
−
1
≡
18
(
m
o
d
47
)
34 
−1
 ≡18(mod47).

wait a minute, let me double-check that. if 
34
×
18
(
m
o
d
47
)
34×18(mod47) equals 1, then it should be correct. let's calculate 
34
×
18
34×18:

34
×
18
=
612
34×18=612.

now, divide 612 by 47 to find the remainder.

47
×
13
=
611
47×13=611, since 
47
×
10
=
470
47×10=470 and 
47
×
3
=
141
47×3=141, and 
470
+
141
=
611
470+141=611.

so, 
612
−
611
=
1
612−611=1.

therefore, 
34
×
18
≡
1
(
m
o
d
47
)
34×18≡1(mod47), which confirms that 18 is indeed the inverse of 34 modulo 47.

alternatively, i could have used the extended euclidean algorithm directly on 34 and 47 to find the inverse, but since i already have the inverse of 13, and 34 is related to -13, this method seems more efficient.

let me briefly consider using the extended euclidean algorithm for completeness.

we need to solve 
34
x
+
47
y
=
1
34x+47y=1 for integers 
x
x and 
y
y.

first, apply the euclidean algorithm to find 
gcd
⁡
(
34
,
47
)
gcd(34,47):

47
=
1
×
34
+
13
47=1×34+13

34
=
2
×
13
+
8
34=2×13+8

13
=
1
×
8
+
5
13=1×8+5

8
=
1
×
5
+
3
8=1×5+3

5
=
1
×
3
+
2
5=1×3+2

3
=
1
×
2
+
1
3=1×2+1

2
=
2
×
1
+
0
2=2×1+0

so, 
gcd
⁡
(
34
,
47
)
=
1
gcd(34,47)=1, which confirms that the inverse exists.

now, back-substitute to express 1 as a combination of 34 and 47:

1
=
3
−
1
×
2
1=3−1×2

but 
2
=
5
−
1
×
3
2=5−1×3, so:

1
=
3
−
1
×
(
5
−
1
×
3
)
=
2
×
3
−
1
×
5
1=3−1×(5−1×3)=2×3−1×5

but 
3
=
8
−
1
×
5
3=8−1×5, so:

1
=
2
×
(
8
−
1
×
5
)
−
1
×
5
=
2
×
8
−
3
×
5
1=2×(8−1×5)−1×5=2×8−3×5

but 
5
=
13
−
1
×
8
5=13−1×8, so:

1
=
2
×
8
−
3
×
(
13
−
1
×
8
)
=
5
×
8
−
3
×
13
1=2×8−3×(13−1×8)=5×8−3×13

but 
8
=
34
−
2
×
13
8=34−2×13, so:

1
=
5
×
(
34
−
2
×
13
)
−
3
×
13
=
5
×
34
−
13
×
13
1=5×(34−2×13)−3×13=5×34−13×13

but 
13
=
47
−
1
×
34
13=47−1×34, so:

1
=
5
×
34
−
13
×
(
47
−
1
×
34
)
=
18
×
34
−
13
×
47
1=5×34−13×(47−1×34)=18×34−13×47

therefore, 
x
=
18
x=18 is the coefficient for 34, meaning 
3
4
−
1
≡
18
(
m
o
d
47
)
34 
−1
 ≡18(mod47), which matches what i found earlier.

this double-check using the extended euclidean algorithm confirms that 18 is indeed the correct inverse of 34 modulo 47.

so, the inverse of 34 modulo 47 is 18.

**final answer**
