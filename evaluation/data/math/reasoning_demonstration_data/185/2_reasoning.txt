Reasoning: Alright, so I need to find the sum of the positive factors of 48. Let's see, factors are the numbers that divide 48 without leaving a remainder. So, I should list out all the numbers that can divide 48 evenly.

First, I know that 1 is always a factor of any number, so 1 is one of them. Then, 48 itself is also a factor. Now, let's think about the numbers in between.

48 divided by 2 is 24, so 2 and 24 are factors. 48 divided by 3 is 16, so 3 and 16 are factors. 48 divided by 4 is 12, so 4 and 12 are factors. 48 divided by 6 is 8, so 6 and 8 are factors.

Wait, let's check if there are any more. 48 divided by 5 is 9.6, which is not a whole number, so 5 isn't a factor. 48 divided by 7 is about 6.857, not a whole number, so 7 isn't a factor either. 48 divided by 9 is 5.333, so no. It seems like I've got all the factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 48.

Now, to find the sum of these factors, I just need to add them up. Let's do that step by step to make sure I don't miss anything.

1 + 2 is 3.

3 + 3 is 6.

6 + 4 is 10.

10 + 6 is 16.

16 + 8 is 24.

24 + 12 is 36.

36 + 16 is 52.

52 + 24 is 76.

76 + 48 is 124.

So, the sum of the positive factors of 48 should be 124. But, wait a minute, I recall there's a formula for the sum of factors using prime factorization. Maybe I should try that to double-check.

First, find the prime factors of 48. 48 can be divided by 2: 48 รท 2 = 24. 24 รท 2 = 12. 12 รท 2 = 6. 6 รท 2 = 3. So, 48 = 2^4 * 3^1.

The formula for the sum of factors is (2^(4+1) - 1)/(2-1) * (3^(1+1) - 1)/(3-1). That's (32 - 1)/1 * (9 - 1)/2, which is 31 * 4 = 124. Okay, that matches what I got earlier by adding them up individually. So, I think 124 is the correct answer.
