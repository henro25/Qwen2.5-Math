Answer: To find the sum of the positive factors of 48:

1. **List the positive factors of 48:**
   - 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48

2. **Sum the factors:**
   - 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 24 + 48 = 124

3. **Alternatively, using prime factorization:**
   - Prime factorization of 48: \( 2^4 \times 3^1 \)
   - Sum of factors formula: \( (2^{4+1} - 1)/(2-1) \times (3^{1+1} - 1)/(3-1) = 31 \times 4 = 124 \)

**Answer:** The sum of the positive factors of 48 is **124**.
