Answer: The given series is \(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + \cdots + 1024\), which is a geometric series with the first term \(a = 1\) and common ratio \(r = 2\).

to find the number of terms \(n\), we use the formula for the \(n\)-th term of a geometric series:
\[
a \cdot r^{n-1} = 1024
\]
\[
1 \cdot 2^{n-1} = 1024
\]
\[
2^{n-1} = 2^{10}
\]
\[
n-1 = 10 \implies n = 11
\]

the sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series is given by:
\[
s = a \cdot \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}
\]
substituting the values:
\[
s = 1 \cdot \frac{2^{11} - 1}{2 - 1}
\]
\[
s = 2^{11} - 1
\]
\[
s = 2048 - 1 = 2047
\]

thus, the sum of the series is:
\[
\boxed{2047}
\]
