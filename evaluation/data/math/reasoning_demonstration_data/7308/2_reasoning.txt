Reasoning: So i have this problem: what is the sum of 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + ... + 1024? alright, let's see. i recognize that this is a sequence where each term is double the previous one. so it's like 1, then 1 times 2 is 2, then 2 times 2 is 4, and so on, up to 1024.

first, i need to find out how many terms there are in this series. the first term is 1, and the last term is 1024. since each term is multiplied by 2, this is a geometric series with a common ratio of 2.

i remember there's a formula for the sum of a geometric series: s = a * (r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

so, in this case, a = 1, r = 2, and i need to find n such that the nth term is 1024.

the nth term of a geometric series is given by a * r^(n-1). so, 1 * 2^(n-1) = 1024.

let me solve for n: 2^(n-1) = 1024.

i know that 2^10 = 1024, because 2^10 is 1024. so, 2^(n-1) = 2^10, which means n-1 = 10, so n = 11.

so there are 11 terms in this series.

now, plugging back into the sum formula: s = 1 * (2^11 - 1)/(2 - 1).

simplify the denominator: 2 - 1 is 1, so s = 2^11 - 1.

i know that 2^10 is 1024, so 2^11 is 2048. therefore, s = 2048 - 1 = 2047.

wait a minute, is there another way to check this? maybe by adding the terms step by step.

let's add them:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 4 = 7

7 + 8 = 15

15 + 16 = 31

31 + 32 = 63

63 + 64 = 127

127 + 128 = 255

255 + 256 = 511

511 + 512 = 1023

1023 + 1024 = 2047

okay, that matches the earlier result. so, the sum is 2047.

alternatively, i recall that in a geometric series, the sum can also be calculated by multiplying the last term by 2 and then subtracting the first term. so, s = last term * 2 - first term.

here, last term is 1024, so s = 1024 * 2 - 1 = 2048 - 1 = 2047.

that confirms it again.

i think that's correct. maybe i should look up the formula again to be sure.

yes, the sum of a geometric series is indeed s = a * (r^n - 1)/(r - 1), and since r is not equal to 1, this formula applies.

alternatively, since r = 2, and the series is 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 1024, it's also the sum of powers of 2 from 2^0 up to 2^10.

sum from k=0 to k=10 of 2^k is 2^(11) - 1, which is again 2048 - 1 = 2047.

so, multiple methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring.

i don't think there's anything else to consider here. the series is finite, and all terms are positive, so no issues with convergence or anything like that.

therefore, the sum is 2047.

**final answer**

2047
