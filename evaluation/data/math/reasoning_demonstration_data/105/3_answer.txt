Answer: Given that the perimeter of a square and the circumference of a circle are equal, we need to find the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle.

1. **Perimeter and Circumference Equations:**
   - Perimeter of the square: \( 4s \)
   - Circumference of the circle: \( 2\pi r \)
   - Set them equal: \( 4s = 2\pi r \)

2. **Solve for \( s \) in terms of \( r \):**
   \[
   s = \frac{\pi r}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Areas:**
   - Area of the square: \( s^2 = \left( \frac{\pi r}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{\pi^2 r^2}{4} \)
   - Area of the circle: \( \pi r^2 \)

4. **Find the Ratio of the Areas:**
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Area of square}}{\text{Area of circle}} = \frac{\frac{\pi^2 r^2}{4}}{\pi r^2} = \frac{\pi^2 r^2}{4 \pi r^2} = \frac{\pi}{4}
   \]

Thus, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{4}}
\]
