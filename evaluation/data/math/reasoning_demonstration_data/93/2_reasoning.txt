Reasoning: So i've got this equation: 
x
2
+
y
2
=
10
x
−
6
y
−
34
x 
2
 +y 
2
 =10x−6y−34, and i need to find 
x
+
y
x+y. hmm, let's see. i'm not exactly sure where to start, but i remember that equations involving 
x
2
x 
2
  and 
y
2
y 
2
  often represent circles or something similar. maybe i can rearrange this equation to get it into a more familiar form.

first, i think i should get all the terms involving 
x
x and 
y
y on one side of the equation. so, let's move the 
10
x
10x and 
−
6
y
−6y to the left side:

x
2
−
10
x
+
y
2
+
6
y
=
−
34
x 
2
 −10x+y 
2
 +6y=−34

okay, now i have 
x
2
−
10
x
+
y
2
+
6
y
=
−
34
x 
2
 −10x+y 
2
 +6y=−34. this looks like it might be possible to complete the square for both 
x
x and 
y
y. completing the square is a technique i've learned to turn quadratic equations into perfect squares, which can make them easier to work with.

let's start with the 
x
x-terms: 
x
2
−
10
x
x 
2
 −10x. to complete the square, i need to take half of the coefficient of 
x
x, which is 
−
10
−10, so half of that is 
−
5
−5, and then square it, which gives 
25
25. so, i'll add and subtract 
25
25 to keep the equation balanced.

similarly, for the 
y
y-terms: 
y
2
+
6
y
y 
2
 +6y. half of 
6
6 is 
3
3, and 
3
2
=
9
3 
2
 =9, so i'll add and subtract 
9
9.

let's do that:

x
2
−
10
x
+
25
−
25
+
y
2
+
6
y
+
9
−
9
=
−
34
x 
2
 −10x+25−25+y 
2
 +6y+9−9=−34

wait, that seems a bit messy. maybe i should group them differently.

actually, i think it's better to add the squares directly to both sides. so, for the 
x
x-terms:

x
2
−
10
x
+
25
=
(
x
−
5
)
2
x 
2
 −10x+25=(x−5) 
2
 

and for the 
y
y-terms:

y
2
+
6
y
+
9
=
(
y
+
3
)
2
y 
2
 +6y+9=(y+3) 
2
 

so, i'll add 
25
25 and 
9
9 to both sides to keep the equation balanced:

x
2
−
10
x
+
25
+
y
2
+
6
y
+
9
=
−
34
+
25
+
9
x 
2
 −10x+25+y 
2
 +6y+9=−34+25+9

simplifying the left side:

(
x
−
5
)
2
+
(
y
+
3
)
2
=
0
(x−5) 
2
 +(y+3) 
2
 =0

wait a minute, the right side is 
−
34
+
25
+
9
=
0
−34+25+9=0. so, 
(
x
−
5
)
2
+
(
y
+
3
)
2
=
0
(x−5) 
2
 +(y+3) 
2
 =0.

now, i know that squares of real numbers are always non-negative, meaning they are greater than or equal to zero. so, the sum of two squares is zero only if each square is zero. that means:

(
x
−
5
)
2
=
0
(x−5) 
2
 =0 and 
(
y
+
3
)
2
=
0
(y+3) 
2
 =0

therefore:

x
−
5
=
0
x−5=0 and 
y
+
3
=
0
y+3=0

which gives:

x
=
5
x=5 and 
y
=
−
3
y=−3

so, 
x
+
y
=
5
+
(
−
3
)
=
2
x+y=5+(−3)=2

let me just double-check to make sure i didn't make any mistakes. plugging 
x
=
5
x=5 and 
y
=
−
3
y=−3 back into the original equation:

left side: 
(
5
)
2
+
(
−
3
)
2
=
25
+
9
=
34
(5) 
2
 +(−3) 
2
 =25+9=34

right side: 
10
(
5
)
−
6
(
−
3
)
−
34
=
50
+
18
−
34
=
68
−
34
=
34
10(5)−6(−3)−34=50+18−34=68−34=34

both sides are equal, so it checks out.

therefore, the value of 
x
+
y
x+y is indeed 
2
2.
