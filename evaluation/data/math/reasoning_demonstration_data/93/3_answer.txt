Answer: Given the equation \( x^2 + y^2 = 10x - 6y - 34 \), we need to find \( x + y \).

first, we rearrange the equation to group the \( x \) and \( y \) terms:

\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y = -34 \]

next, we complete the square for both \( x \) and \( y \):

for \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

for \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

adding these to the equation:

\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 = -34 \]

simplify:

\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 = -34 \]

\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 0 \]

since the sum of squares is zero, each square must be zero:

\[ (x - 5)^2 = 0 \]
\[ (y + 3)^2 = 0 \]

thus:

\[ x - 5 = 0 \implies x = 5 \]
\[ y + 3 = 0 \implies y = -3 \]

therefore:

\[ x + y = 5 + (-3) = 2 \]

the value of \( x + y \) is \(\boxed{2}\).
