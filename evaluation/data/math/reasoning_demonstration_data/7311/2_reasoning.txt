Reasoning: So i have to simplify 
(
3
−
2
i
)
2
(3−2i) 
2
 , and the answer should be in the form 
a
+
b
i
a+bi. hmm, let's see. i remember that squaring a binomial involves using the formula 
(
a
−
b
)
2
=
a
2
−
2
a
b
+
b
2
(a−b) 
2
 =a 
2
 −2ab+b 
2
 , but since there's an imaginary unit 
i
i involved here, i need to be careful with that.

first, let's identify 
a
a and 
b
b in this expression. it looks like 
a
=
3
a=3 and 
b
=
2
i
b=2i. so, applying the formula:

(
3
−
2
i
)
2
=
(
3
)
2
−

3

2

(

i
)
2
(3−2i) 
2
 =(3) 
2
 −2×3×2i+(2i) 
2
 
now, let's compute each part step by step.

1. 
(
3
)
2
=
9
(3) 
2
 =9

2. 
2

i
2×3×2i=12i

3. 
(
2
i
)
2
=
4
i
2
(2i) 
2
 =4i 
2
 

wait a minute, i know that 
i
2
=
−
1
i 
2
 =−1, so 
4
i
2
=
4
×
(
−
1
)
=
−
4
4i 
2
 =4×(−1)=−4.

putting it all together:

(
3
−
2
i
)
2
=
9
−
12
i
−
4
(3−2i) 
2
 =9−12i−4
now, combine the real parts:

9
−
4
=
5
9−4=5
so, the expression simplifies to:

5
−
12
i
5−12i
let me just double-check to make sure i didn't make any mistakes. maybe i should expand it using the distributive property (foil method) to confirm.

using foil:

(
3
−
2
i
)
(
3
−
2
i
)
=
3
×
3
+
3

(

(
−

3

(
−

i
)
×
(
−
2
i
)
(3−2i)(3−2i)=3×3+3×(−2i)+(−2i)×3+(−2i)×(−2i)
calculating each term:

1. 
3
×
3
=
9
3×3=9

2. 
3
×
(
−
2
i
)
=
−
6
i
3×(−2i)=−6i

3. 
−
2
i
×
3
=
−
6
i
−2i×3=−6i

4. 
−
2
i
×
−
2
i
=
4
i
2
=
4
×
(
−
1
)
=
−
4
−2i×−2i=4i 
2
 =4×(−1)=−4

now, add them all together:

9
−
6
i
−
6
i
−
4
=
9
−
12
i
−
4
=
5
−
12
i
9−6i−6i−4=9−12i−4=5−12i
okay, that matches what i got earlier. so, i'm confident that the simplified form is 
5
−
12
i
5−12i.

just to be thorough, maybe i can represent this on the complex plane to visualize it. the original number is 
3
−
2
i
3−2i, which is a point at (3, -2) in the complex plane. squaring it should give me another point, and according to my calculation, it's 
5
−
12
i
5−12i, which is at (5, -12). that seems reasonable.

alternatively, i could think about the modulus and argument. the modulus of 
3
−
2
i
3−2i is 
3
2
+
(
−
2
)
2
=
9
+
4
=
13
3 
2
 +(−2) 
2
 
​	
 = 
9+4
​	
 = 
13
​	
 , and its argument is 
arctan
⁡
(
−
2
3
)
arctan( 
3
−2
​	
 ).

when you square a complex number, the modulus is squared, and the argument is doubled. so, the modulus of 
(
3
−
2
i
)
2
(3−2i) 
2
  should be 
(
13
)
2
=
13
( 
13
​	
 ) 
2
 =13, and the argument should be 
2
×
arctan
⁡
(
−
2
3
)
2×arctan( 
3
−2
​	
 ).

let me check if this matches with my simplified form 
5
−
12
i
5−12i. the modulus of 
5
−
12
i
5−12i is 
5
2
+
(
−
12
)
2
=
25
+
144
=
169
=
13
5 
2
 +(−12) 
2
 
​	
 = 
25+144
​	
 = 
169
​	
 =13, which matches. the argument is 
arctan
⁡
(
−
12
5
)
arctan( 
5
−12
​	
 ), which should be double the original argument.

given that 
arctan
⁡
(
−
12
5
)
arctan( 
5
−12
​	
 ) is indeed approximately double 
arctan
⁡
(
−
2
3
)
arctan( 
3
−2
​	
 ), this further confirms that my simplification is correct.

i think i've covered it from multiple angles, and everything checks out. so, the final answer should be 
5
−
12
i
5−12i.

**final answer**
