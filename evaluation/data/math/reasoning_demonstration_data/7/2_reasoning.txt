Reasoning: Okay, so I have this problem here about stacking coins in the United States, and I need to figure out how many coins are in a stack that's exactly 14 millimeters high. The coins have different thicknesses: a penny is 1.55 mm, a nickel is 1.95 mm, a dime is 1.35 mm, and a quarter is 1.75 mm. I need to find out the number of coins that add up to exactly 14 mm.

Hmm, let's see. I think I need to consider all possible combinations of these coins and see which combination adds up to 14 mm in thickness. But that sounds complicated because there are so many possible combinations, especially if there are multiple coins of each type.

Maybe there's a simpler way. Perhaps I can set up an equation where I let the number of pennies be p, nickels be n, dimes be d, and quarters be q. Then the total thickness would be:

1.55p + 1.95n + 1.35d + 1.75q = 14

And I need to find integer values for p, n, d, q that satisfy this equation.

But that seems like a lot of variables to deal with. Maybe I can reduce the number of variables by assuming that only one type of coin is used, and see if any single type can make up 14 mm.

Let's try that. If I use only pennies, each is 1.55 mm, so 14 divided by 1.55 is about 9.03, which isn't an integer, so that doesn't work.

Nickels are 1.95 mm each. 14 divided by 1.95 is about 7.18, not an integer.

Dimes are 1.35 mm each. 14 divided by 1.35 is about 10.37, not an integer.

Quarters are 1.75 mm each. 14 divided by 1.75 is exactly 8. So, if I use eight quarters, the total thickness would be 8 times 1.75 mm, which is 14 mm. So, one possible solution is eight quarters.

But the problem says "a stack of these coins," which might imply that there could be a mix of different coins, not just one type. So, maybe there are other combinations that also add up to 14 mm.

I should check if there are other combinations with different types of coins.

Let me try using quarters and dimes. Suppose I have q quarters and d dimes.

Then, the total thickness is 1.75q + 1.35d = 14.

I need to find integer values for q and d that satisfy this equation.

I can rearrange the equation to solve for d in terms of q:

1.35d = 14 - 1.75q

d = (14 - 1.75q) / 1.35

I need d to be an integer, so (14 - 1.75q) must be divisible by 1.35.

This seems a bit messy. Maybe I can multiply both sides by 100 to eliminate decimals:

135d = 1400 - 175q

Simplify:

135d + 175q = 1400

I can divide the entire equation by 5 to make it simpler:

27d + 35q = 280

Now, I need to find integer solutions for d and q in this equation.

This is a linear Diophantine equation. To solve it, I can express one variable in terms of the other.

Let's solve for d:

27d = 280 - 35q

d = (280 - 35q) / 27

For d to be an integer, (280 - 35q) must be divisible by 27.

Let me see what values of q make this true.

Let's try q = 4:

d = (280 - 140) / 27 = 140 / 27, which is not an integer.

q = 5:

d = (280 - 175) / 27 = 105 / 27 ≈ 3.888, not an integer.

q = 2:

d = (280 - 70) / 27 = 210 / 27 ≈ 7.777, not an integer.

q = 1:

d = (280 - 35) / 27 = 245 / 27 ≈ 9.074, not an integer.

q = 0:

d = 280 / 27 ≈ 10.37, not an integer.

Hmm, none of these are giving me integer values for d. Maybe there are no solutions with quarters and dimes alone.

Let me try another combination, say quarters and nickels.

Total thickness: 1.75q + 1.95n = 14

Multiply by 100: 175q + 195n = 1400

Simplify by dividing by 5: 35q + 39n = 280

Solve for n: 39n = 280 - 35q

n = (280 - 35q) / 39

Again, need n to be integer, so (280 - 35q) must be divisible by 39.

Let's try q = 4:

n = (280 - 140) / 39 = 140 / 39 ≈ 3.589, not integer.

q = 5:

n = (280 - 175) / 39 = 105 / 39 = 2.692, not integer.

q = 2:

n = (280 - 70) / 39 = 210 / 39 ≈ 5.384, not integer.

q = 1:

n = (280 - 35) / 39 = 245 / 39 ≈ 6.28, not integer.

q = 0:

n = 280 / 39 ≈ 7.179, not integer.

No luck here either.

Maybe I should try using all types of coins.

So, total thickness: 1.55p + 1.95n + 1.35d + 1.75q = 14

This seems too complicated with four variables. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Perhaps I can look for the combination that gives the fewest number of coins, or maybe look for combinations that use only two types of coins.

Wait, the problem is just asking for how many coins are in the stack, not specifying the types. So, maybe there are multiple possible numbers of coins that can make up 14 mm.

But the problem says "exactly 14 mm high," and asks for "how many coins are in the stack," implying there might be one specific answer.

But from my earlier attempt, using eight quarters gives exactly 14 mm. Are there other combinations that also sum to 14 mm with a different number of coins?

Let me try using dimes and nickels.

Thickness: 1.35d + 1.95n = 14

Multiply by 100: 135d + 195n = 1400

Divide by 15: 9d + 13n = 93.333... Wait, that doesn't make sense. 1400 divided by 15 is 93.333, which is not an integer.

I must have made a mistake in dividing.

135 and 195 are both divisible by 15.

135 / 15 = 9

195 / 15 = 13

1400 / 15 = 93.333...

So, 9d + 13n = 93.333..., which is not possible since left side is integer, right side is not. So, no solutions here.

Maybe dimes and pennies.

Thickness: 1.35d + 1.55p = 14

Multiply by 100: 135d + 155p = 1400

Simplify by dividing by 5: 27d + 31p = 280

Solve for p: 31p = 280 - 27d

p = (280 - 27d) / 31

Need p to be integer, so (280 - 27d) must be divisible by 31.

Let's try d = 4:

p = (280 - 108) / 31 = 172 / 31 ≈ 5.548, not integer.

d = 5:

p = (280 - 135) / 31 = 145 / 31 ≈ 4.677, not integer.

d = 3:

p = (280 - 81) / 31 = 199 / 31 ≈ 6.419, not integer.

d = 2:

p = (280 - 54) / 31 = 226 / 31 ≈ 7.29, not integer.

d = 1:

p = (280 - 27) / 31 = 253 / 31 ≈ 8.161, not integer.

d = 0:

p = 280 / 31 ≈ 9.032, not integer.

No solutions here either.

This is getting frustrating. Maybe I should try using quarters and pennies.

Thickness: 1.75q + 1.55p = 14

Multiply by 100: 175q + 155p = 1400

Simplify by dividing by 5: 35q + 31p = 280

Solve for p: 31p = 280 - 35q

p = (280 - 35q) / 31

Need p to be integer, so (280 - 35q) must be divisible by 31.

Let's try q = 4:

p = (280 - 140) / 31 = 140 / 31 ≈ 4.516, not integer.

q = 5:

p = (280 - 175) / 31 = 105 / 31 ≈ 3.387, not integer.

q = 3:

p = (280 - 105) / 31 = 175 / 31 ≈ 5.645, not integer.

q = 2:

p = (280 - 70) / 31 = 210 / 31 ≈ 6.774, not integer.

q = 1:

p = (280 - 35) / 31 = 245 / 31 ≈ 7.903, not integer.

q = 0:

p = 280 / 31 ≈ 9.032, not integer.

No luck here either.

Maybe I need to consider using all four types of coins. But that seems too complicated.

Wait a minute, maybe there's a pattern or a common multiple I can use.

Looking back, the thicknesses are:

Penny: 1.55 mm

Nickel: 1.95 mm

Dime: 1.35 mm

Quarter: 1.75 mm

I notice that all these thicknesses are multiples of 0.05 mm. So, maybe I can express everything in terms of 0.05 mm units.

Let's define a unit of 0.05 mm.

Then:

Penny: 1.55 / 0.05 = 31 units

Nickel: 1.95 / 0.05 = 39 units

Dime: 1.35 / 0.05 = 27 units

Quarter: 1.75 / 0.05 = 35 units

Total stack height: 14 mm / 0.05 mm/unit = 280 units

So, the equation becomes:

31p + 39n + 27d + 35q = 280

Now, I need to find non-negative integers p, n, d, q that satisfy this equation.

This seems more manageable. Maybe I can look for solutions where some variables are zero.

For example, if p = 0, then:

39n + 27d + 35q = 280

This is still a bit tricky, but perhaps I can fix one variable and solve for the others.

Let's try fixing q.

Suppose q = 4:

39n + 27d + 140 = 280 → 39n + 27d = 140

Divide by 3: 13n + 9d = 140/3 ≈ 46.666, which is not an integer. So, no solution here.

q = 5:

39n + 27d + 175 = 280 → 39n + 27d = 105

Divide by 3: 13n + 9d = 35

Now, solve for d: 9d = 35 - 13n → d = (35 - 13n)/9

Need d to be integer, so (35 - 13n) must be divisible by 9.

Let's try n = 1:

d = (35 - 13)/9 = 22/9 ≈ 2.444, not integer.

n = 2:

d = (35 - 26)/9 = 9/9 = 1, which is integer.

So, n = 2, d = 1.

So, one solution is q = 5, n = 2, d = 1, p = 0.

Total coins: 5 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 8 coins.

But earlier, using eight quarters alone also gives 14 mm. So, another solution is p = 0, n = 0, d = 0, q = 8.

Total coins: 0 + 0 + 0 + 8 = 8 coins.

So, both solutions have 8 coins.

Wait, maybe 8 is the only possible number of coins.

Let me check another value for q.

q = 6:

39n + 27d + 210 = 280 → 39n + 27d = 70

Divide by 3: 13n + 9d = 70/3 ≈ 23.333, not integer.

No solution.

q = 7:

39n + 27d + 245 = 280 → 39n + 27d = 35

Divide by 3: 13n + 9d = 35/3 ≈ 11.666, not integer.

No solution.

q = 3:

39n + 27d + 105 = 280 → 39n + 27d = 175

Divide by 3: 13n + 9d = 175/3 ≈ 58.333, not integer.

No solution.

q = 4:

As before, no solution.

q = 2:

39n + 27d + 70 = 280 → 39n + 27d = 210

Divide by 3: 13n + 9d = 70

Solve for d: d = (70 - 13n)/9

Need d integer, so (70 - 13n) must be divisible by 9.

Let's try n = 1:

d = (70 - 13)/9 = 57/9 = 6.333, not integer.

n = 2:

d = (70 - 26)/9 = 44/9 ≈ 4.888, not integer.

n = 4:

d = (70 - 52)/9 = 18/9 = 2, integer.

So, n = 4, d = 2.

Then q = 2.

Total coins: 0 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 8 coins.

Again, 8 coins.

q = 1:

39n + 27d + 35 = 280 → 39n + 27d = 245

Divide by 3: 13n + 9d = 81.666..., not integer.

No solution.

q = 0:

39n + 27d = 280

Divide by 3: 13n + 9d = 280/3 ≈ 93.333, not integer.

No solution.

So, in all cases where p = 0, the total number of coins is 8.

What if p > 0?

Let me try p = 1.

Then, 31 + 39n + 27d + 35q = 280 → 39n + 27d + 35q = 249

Divide by 3: 13n + 9d + (35/3)q = 83, but 35 isn't divisible by 3, so this approach isn't helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can fix p and solve for the others, but this seems too time-consuming.

Given that all solutions I've found so far have 8 coins, maybe 8 is the only possible number of coins in the stack that adds up to exactly 14 mm.

So, the answer is 8 coins.
