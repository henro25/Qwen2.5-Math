Reasoning: 
Alright, so I've got this problem here: "Eleven is the fifth prime number. What is the tenth prime number?" Okay, let's see. I know that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.

First, I need to confirm if eleven is indeed the fifth prime number. Let's list them out:

1. 2 (the first prime)

2. 3 (second)

3. 5 (third)

4. 7 (fourth)

5. 11 (fifth)

Wait a minute, what about 9? Is 9 a prime number? No, 9 is divisible by 3, so it's not prime. So, after 7, the next prime is 11. Okay, that checks out.

Now, I need to find the tenth prime number. So, I need to list out the primes up to the tenth one.

Starting from 11, the fifth prime, let's find the next five primes to get to the tenth.

6th prime: 13 (it's only divisible by 1 and 13)

7th prime: 17 (only divisible by 1 and 17)

8th prime: 19 (only divisible by 1 and 19)

9th prime: 23 (only divisible by 1 and 23)

10th prime: 29 (only divisible by 1 and 29)

So, the tenth prime number is 29.

But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't skip any primes or include any non-primes.

After 11, the next number is 12, which is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6, so not prime.

13 is prime.

14 is not prime (divisible by 2 and 7).

15 is not prime (divisible by 3 and 5).

16 is not prime (divisible by 2, 4, 8).

17 is prime.

18 is not prime (divisible by 2, 3, 6, 9).

19 is prime.

20 is not prime (divisible by 2, 4, 5, 10).

21 is not prime (divisible by 3 and 7).

22 is not prime (divisible by 2 and 11).

23 is prime.

24 is not prime (divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12).

25 is not prime (divisible by 5).

26 is not prime (divisible by 2 and 13).

27 is not prime (divisible by 3 and 9).

28 is not prime (divisible by 2, 4, 7, 14).

29 is prime.

So, counting them again:

1. 2

2. 3

3. 5

4. 7

5. 11

6. 13

7. 17

8. 19

9. 23

10. 29

Yes, that seems correct. The tenth prime number is 29.
