Reasoning: 
So i need to find the cross product of these two vectors: 
(
5
2
−
6
)
​
  
5
2
−6
​
  
​
  and 
(
1
1
3
)
​
  
1
1
3
​
  
​
 . i remember that the cross product of two vectors in three-dimensional space results in a new vector that is perpendicular to both of the original vectors. but i'm a bit rusty on the exact formula, so i need to recall how to compute it.

let me think. the cross product of vectors 
a
=
(
a
1
a
2
a
3
)
a= 
​
  
a 
1
​
 
a 
2
​
 
a 
3
​
 
​
  
​
  and 
b
=
(
b
1
b
2
b
3
)
b= 
​
  
b 
1
​
 
b 
2
​
 
b 
3
​
 
​
  
​
  is given by the determinant of a 3x3 matrix that has the standard unit vectors 
i
i, 
j
j, and 
k
k in the first row, the components of 
a
a in the second row, and the components of 
b
b in the third row.

so, the formula is:

a
×
b
=
∣
i
j
k
a
1
a
2
a
3
b
1
b
2
b
3
∣
a×b= 
​
  
i
a 
1
​
 
b 
1
​
 
​
  
j
a 
2
​
 
b 
2
​
 
​
  
k
a 
3
​
 
b 
3
​
 
​
  
​
 
to compute this determinant, i can expand it using the rule for 3x3 determinants. that is:

a
×
b
=
i
(
a
2
b
3
−
a
3
b
2
)
−
j
(
a
1
b
3
−
a
3
b
1
)
+
k
(
a
1
b
2
−
a
2
b
1
)
a×b=i(a 
2
​
 b 
3
​
 −a 
3
​
 b 
2
​
 )−j(a 
1
​
 b 
3
​
 −a 
3
​
 b 
1
​
 )+k(a 
1
​
 b 
2
​
 −a 
2
​
 b 
1
​
 )
alright, let's apply this to the given vectors.

first, identify the components:

a
=
(
5
2
−
6
)
,
b
=
(
1
1
3
)
a= 
​
  
5
2
−6
​
  
​
 ,b= 
​
  
1
1
3
​
  
​
 
so, 
a
1
=
5
a 
1
​
 =5, 
a
2
=
2
a 
2
​
 =2, 
a
3
=
−
6
a 
3
​
 =−6, 
b
1
=
1
b 
1
​
 =1, 
b
2
=
1
b 
2
​
 =1, and 
b
3
=
3
b 
3
​
 =3.

now, plug these into the formula:

a
×
b
=
i
(
2
⋅
3
−
(
−
6
)
⋅
1
)
−
j
(
5
⋅
3
−
(
−
6
)
⋅
1
)
+
k
(
5
⋅
1
−
2
⋅
1
)
a×b=i(2⋅3−(−6)⋅1)−j(5⋅3−(−6)⋅1)+k(5⋅1−2⋅1)
let's compute each component step by step.

first, the coefficient for 
i
i:

2
⋅
3
=
6
2⋅3=6
−
6
⋅
1
=
−
6
−6⋅1=−6
6
−
(
−
6
)
=
6
+
6
=
12
6−(−6)=6+6=12
so, the 
i
i component is 12.

next, the coefficient for 
j
j:

5
⋅
3
=
15
5⋅3=15
−
6
⋅
1
=
−
6
−6⋅1=−6
15
−
(
−
6
)
=
15
+
6
=
21
15−(−6)=15+6=21
but remember, there's a negative sign in front of 
j
j, so it's 
−
21
−21.

finally, the coefficient for 
k
k:

5
⋅
1
=
5
5⋅1=5
2
⋅
1
=
2
2⋅1=2
5
−
2
=
3
5−2=3
so, the 
k
k component is 3.

putting it all together, the cross product is:

a
×
b
=
12
i
−
21
j
+
3
k
a×b=12i−21j+3k
which can be written in vector form as:

a
×
b
=
(
12
−
21
3
)
a×b= 
​
  
12
−21
3
​
  
​
 
wait a minute, let me double-check these calculations to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

first component: 
a
2
b
3
−
a
3
b
2
=
2
⋅
3
−
(
−
6
)
⋅
1
=
6
+
6
=
12
a 
2
​
 b 
3
​
 −a 
3
​
 b 
2
​
 =2⋅3−(−6)⋅1=6+6=12. that seems correct.

second component: 
a
1
b
3
−
a
3
b
1
=
5
⋅
3
−
(
−
6
)
⋅
1
=
15
+
6
=
21
a 
1
​
 b 
3
​
 −a 
3
​
 b 
1
​
 =5⋅3−(−6)⋅1=15+6=21, and with the negative sign, it's -21. that looks good.

third component: 
a
1
b
2
−
a
2
b
1
=
5
⋅
1
−
2
⋅
1
=
5
−
2
=
3
a 
1
​
 b 
2
​
 −a 
2
​
 b 
1
​
 =5⋅1−2⋅1=5−2=3. yep, that's right.

so, the cross product should indeed be 
(
12
−
21
3
)
​
  
12
−21
3
​
  
​
 .

alternatively, i could use the method of calculating the cross product using the sine of the angle between them times the magnitudes, but that seems more complicated for vectors given in component form. the determinant method is more straightforward here.

let me just recall that the cross product is anti-commutative, meaning that 
a
×
b
=
−
(
b
×
a
)
a×b=−(b×a), which is a good property to keep in mind, but not necessary for this calculation.

also, the cross product vector is perpendicular to both 
a
a and 
b
b, which i can verify by taking the dot product of the cross product with each of the original vectors and ensuring that it's zero.

let's check that quickly.

first, 
a
⋅
(
a
×
b
)
a⋅(a×b):

5
⋅
12
+
2
⋅
(
−
21
)
+
(
−
6
)
⋅
3
=
60
−
42
−
18
=
0
5⋅12+2⋅(−21)+(−6)⋅3=60−42−18=0
good, that's zero.

next, 
b
⋅
(
a
×
b
)
b⋅(a×b):

1
⋅
12
+
1
⋅
(
−
21
)
+
3
⋅
3
=
12
−
21
+
9
=
0
1⋅12+1⋅(−21)+3⋅3=12−21+9=0
also zero. so, the cross product vector is indeed perpendicular to both original vectors, which is a good sanity check.

is there another way to compute the cross product? maybe using the component formula directly without writing out the determinant.

yes, there's a formula that defines each component directly:

(
a
×
b
)
x
=
a
y
b
z
−
a
z
b
y
(a×b) 
x
​

let's apply this formula to verify our previous result.

​
 =5⋅1−2⋅1=5−2=3
this matches the result i got earlier, so i'm confident that 
(
12
−
21
3
)
​
  
12
−21
3
​
  
​
  is the correct cross product.

another thing i could consider is the geometric interpretation. the magnitude of the cross product is equal to the area of the parallelogram spanned by the vectors 
a
a and 
b
b, and its direction is given by the right-hand rule.

while this is interesting, for this problem, computing the components is sufficient.

just to be thorough, let's calculate the magnitude of the cross product to see if it makes sense.

the magnitude of 
a
×
b
a×b is:

∥
a
×
b
∥
=
1
2
2
+
(
−
21
)
2
+
3
2
=
144
+
441
+
9
=
594
∥a×b∥= 
12 
2
 +(−21) 
2
 +3 
2
 
​
 = 
144+441+9
​
 = 
594
​
 
simplifying, 
594
=
9
×
66
=
3
66
594
​
 = 
9×66
​
 =3 
66
​
 , which is approximately 24.37.

now, the magnitude can also be calculated using the formula:

∥
a
×
b
∥
=
∥
a
∥
∥
b
∥
sin
⁡
(
θ
)
∥a×b∥=∥a∥∥b∥sin(θ)
where 
θ
θ is the angle between 
a
a and 
b
b.

let's compute the magnitudes of 
a
a and 
b
b:

∥
a
∥
=
5
2
+
2
2
+
(
−
6
)
2
=
25
+
4
+
36
=
65
∥a∥= 
5 
2
 +2 
2
 +(−6) 
2
 
​
 = 
25+4+36
​
 = 
65
​
 
∥
b
∥
=
1
2
+
1
2
+
3

=

9
=
11
∥b∥= 
1 
2
 +1 
2
 +3 
2
 
​
 = 
1+1+9
​
 = 
11
​
 
so,

∥
a
∥
∥
b
∥
=
65
⋅
11
=
715
∥a∥∥b∥= 
65
​
 ⋅ 
11
​
 = 
715
​
 
and since 
∥
a
×
b
∥
=
3
66
∥a×b∥=3 
66
​
 , we can set up the equation:

3
66
=
715
sin
⁡
(
θ
)
3 
66
​
 = 
715
​
 sin(θ)
solving for 
sin
⁡
(
θ
)
sin(θ):

sin
⁡
(
θ
)
=
3
66
715
sin(θ)= 
715
​
 
3 
66
​
 
​
 
this gives a value for 
θ
θ, but since the problem doesn't ask for the angle, i don't need to pursue this further.

in summary, after computing the cross product using the determinant method and verifying it with the component formula, and also checking that the resulting vector is perpendicular to both original vectors, i'm confident that the cross product of 
(
5
2
−
6
)
​
  
5
2
−6
​
  
​
  and 
(
1
1
3
)
​
  
1

3
​
  
​
  is indeed 
(
12
−
21
3
)
​
  
12
−21
3
​
  
​
 .

**final answer**

(
12
−
21
3
)
​
  
12
−21
3
​
  
​
 
​
