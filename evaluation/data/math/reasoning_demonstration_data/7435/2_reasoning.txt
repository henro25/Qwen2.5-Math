Reasoning: So i have this problem here: for what values of 
x
x is the expression 
log
⁡
(
3
−
x
)
x
−
1
x−1
​	
 
log(3−x)
​	
  defined? okay, let's see. i need to find the domain of this function, meaning the set of all real numbers 
x
x for which this expression makes sense and doesn't lead to any undefined operations like division by zero or taking the logarithm of a non-positive number.

first, let's look at the numerator: 
log
⁡
(
3
−
x
)
log(3−x). i know that the logarithm function is only defined for positive arguments. so, 
3
−
x
3−x must be greater than zero. that gives me the inequality:

3
−
x
>
0
3−x>0
−
x
>
−
3
−x>−3
x
<
3
x<3
so, 
x
x has to be less than 3 for the logarithm to be defined.

next, the denominator is 
x
−
1
x−1
​	
 . square roots are only defined for non-negative numbers, but since it's in the denominator, the expression inside the square root must be positive (it can't be zero because that would make the denominator zero, and division by zero is undefined). so, i need:

x
−
1
>
0
x−1>0
x
>
1
x>1
therefore, 
x
x has to be greater than 1 for the denominator to be defined and non-zero.

now, combining these two conditions:

1. 
x
<
3
x<3

2. 
x
>
1
x>1

so, 
x
x must be between 1 and 3. in other words:

1
<
x
<
3
1<x<3
let me check if there are any other restrictions i might have missed. the logarithm function is defined for positive arguments, which i already covered by requiring 
3
−
x
>
0
3−x>0. the square root in the denominator requires 
x
−
1
>
0
x−1>0, which i've also addressed.

is there anything else? maybe i should consider if there are any points where the denominator becomes zero within this interval. well, 
x
−
1
=
0
x−1=0 when 
x
=
1
x=1, but since 
x
>
1
x>1, that point is excluded, which is good.

also, i should ensure that 
3
−
x
3−x doesn't approach zero in a way that could cause issues, but since 
x
x is approaching 3 from below, 
3
−
x
3−x approaches zero from the positive side, and the logarithm of a number approaching zero from the positive side goes to negative infinity, but that's still a defined value in the extended real number system, though in practical terms, the function approaches negative infinity as 
x
x approaches 3 from below.

however, since we're only concerned with where the expression is defined, and not its limits, i don't need to worry about that for this problem.

let me summarize:

- for 
log
⁡
(
3
−
x
)
log(3−x) to be defined: 
3
−
x
>
0
3−x>0 ⇒ 
x
<
3
x<3

- for 
x
−
1
x−1
​	
  to be defined and non-zero: 
x
−
1
>
0
x−1>0 ⇒ 
x
>
1
x>1

combining these:

1
<
x
<
3
1<x<3
therefore, the expression 
log
⁡
(
3
−
x
)
x
−
1
x−1
​	
 
log(3−x)
​	
  is defined for all real numbers 
x
x such that 
x
x is greater than 1 and less than 3.

just to be thorough, let's pick a value within this interval and check if the expression is indeed defined. let's choose 
x
=
2
x=2:

log
⁡
(
3
−
2
)
=
log
⁡
1
=
0
log(3−2)=log1=0
2
−
1
=
1
=
1
2−1
​	
 = 
1
​	
 =1
0
1
=
0
1
0
​	
 =0
that's defined.

now, let's pick a value outside this interval. for example, 
x
=
0
x=0:

\[ \log{(3 - 0)} = \log{3} \), which is defined.

\[ \sqrt{0 - 1} = \sqrt{-1} \), which is not a real number.

so, the expression is undefined at 
x
=
0
x=0, which is consistent with our interval.

another test: 
x
=
4
x=4:

\[ \log{(3 - 4)} = \log{(-1)} \), which is undefined in real numbers.

\[ \sqrt{4 - 1} = \sqrt{3} \), which is defined.

but since the logarithm is undefined, the whole expression is undefined at 
x
=
4
x=4, again consistent with our interval.

lastly, 
x
=
1
x=1:

\[ \log{(3 - 1)} = \log{2} \), which is defined.

1
−
1
=
0
=
0
1−1
​	
 = 
0
​	
 =0
so, the denominator is zero, which makes the expression undefined at 
x
=
1
x=1, even though the logarithm is defined there.

therefore, all the checks confirm that the expression is only defined for 
1
<
x
<
3
1<x<3.

**final answer**

1<x<3​
