Reasoning: Alright, so I've got this problem here: "How many seconds are in 7.8 minutes?" Okay, let's see. I know that minutes and seconds are both units of time, and I remember that there are 60 seconds in one minute. So, if I have 7 minutes, that should be 7 times 60 seconds, which is 420 seconds. But wait, it's not 7 minutes; it's 7.8 minutes. That decimal is throwing me off a bit.

Hmm, so 7.8 minutes is like 7 minutes and 0.8 of a minute. I need to figure out what 0.8 of a minute is in seconds. Since one minute is 60 seconds, 0.8 of that would be 0.8 times 60. Let me calculate that. 0.8 times 60... Okay, 0.8 times 60 is 48. So, 0.8 of a minute is 48 seconds.

Now, if I have 7 minutes, that's 420 seconds, and then I add the 48 seconds from the 0.8 of a minute, that should give me the total number of seconds in 7.8 minutes. So, 420 plus 48 equals 468 seconds. Wait a second, is that right? Let me double-check.

Another way to look at it is to convert the entire 7.8 minutes into seconds directly. Since 1 minute is 60 seconds, I can multiply 7.8 by 60. Let's see, 7 times 60 is 420, and 0.8 times 60 is 48, so yeah, 420 plus 48 is 468 seconds. That seems consistent.

But maybe I should try a different approach to be sure. What if I convert minutes to seconds using decimals? Like, 7.8 minutes times 60 seconds per minute. So, 7.8 times 60. Let's calculate that.

First, 7 times 60 is 420, and 0.8 times 60 is 48, so adding them up gives me 468 seconds again. Okay, that matches my previous answer. I'm starting to feel more confident about this.

Wait, but let me think about it differently. If I have 7.8 minutes, and I know that 1 minute is 60 seconds, then 7.8 minutes should be 7.8 multiplied by 60 seconds. So, 7.8 times 60. To calculate that, I can break it down: 7 times 60 is 420, and 0.8 times 60 is 48, so 420 plus 48 is 468 seconds. Yeah, that seems right.

Is there another way to verify this? Maybe using fractions. 0.8 is the same as 4/5, right? So, 4/5 of a minute is 4/5 times 60 seconds, which is 48 seconds. Adding that to 7 minutes (420 seconds) gives me 468 seconds again. Okay, that checks out.

I guess I've done this in a few different ways and keep getting the same answer, so I'm pretty sure that 7.8 minutes is equal to 468 seconds.
