Answer: To find how many seconds are in 7.8 minutes:

1. **Understand the relationship between minutes and seconds:**  
   1 minute = 60 seconds.

2. **Convert 7.8 minutes to seconds:**  
   Multiply 7.8 by 60.

3. **Perform the calculation:**  
   - 7 minutes × 60 seconds/minute = 420 seconds  
   - 0.8 minutes × 60 seconds/minute = 48 seconds  
   - Total seconds = 420 + 48 = 468 seconds.
