Problem: A triangle is made of wood sticks of lengths 8, 15 and 17 inches joined end-to-end. Pieces of the same integral length are cut from each of the sticks so that the three remaining pieces can no longer form a triangle. How many inches are in the length of the smallest piece that can be cut from each of the three sticks to make this happen?
