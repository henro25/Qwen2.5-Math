Reasoning: 
Let's dive into this problem. so, we have this equation:

(
x
−
13
3
)
(
x
−
53
3
)
(
x
−
103
3
)
=
1
3
(x− 
3
  
13
​
 )(x− 
3
  
53
​
 )(x− 
3
  
103
​
 )= 
3
1
​
 
and it has three distinct solutions 
r
,
s
,
t
r,s,t. we need to find 
r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
r 
3
 +s 
3
 +t 
3
 .

first, i need to recall some algebraic concepts. it seems like this is a cubic equation because it's a product of three linear factors set equal to a constant. so, expanding this might give me a cubic polynomial in terms of x.

let me try expanding the left side:

(
x
−
a
)
(
x
−
b
)
(
x
−
c
)
=
x
3
−
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
x
2
+
(
a
b
+
a
c
+
b
c
)
x
−
a
b
c
(x−a)(x−b)(x−c)=x 
3
 −(a+b+c)x 
2
 +(ab+ac+bc)x−abc
where 
a
=
13
3
a= 
3
  
13
​
 , 
b
=
53
3
b= 
3
  
53
​
 , and 
c
=
103
3
c= 
3
  
103
​
 .

so, expanding, we get:

x
3
−
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
x
2
+
(
a
b
+
a
c
+
b
c
)
x
−
a
b
c
=
1
3
x 
3
 −(a+b+c)x 
2
 +(ab+ac+bc)x−abc= 
3
1
​
 
to make it a standard cubic equation, i'll subtract 
1
3
3
1
​
  from both sides:

x
3
−
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
x
2
+
(
a
b
+
a
c
+
b
c
)
x
−
a
b
c
−
1
3
=
0
x 
3
 −(a+b+c)x 
2
 +(ab+ac+bc)x−abc− 
3
1
​
 =0
now, this is a cubic equation of the form:

x
3
+
p
x
2
+
q
x
+
r
=
0
x 
3
 +px 
2
 +qx+r=0
where:

- 
p
=
−
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
p=−(a+b+c)

- 
q
=
a
b
+
a
c
+
b
c
q=ab+ac+bc

- 
r
=
−
a
b
c
−
1
3
r=−abc− 
3
1
​
 

in general, for a cubic equation 
x
3
+
p
x
2
+
q
x
+
r
=
0
x 
3
 +px 
2
 +qx+r=0, the sum of the roots 
r
+
s
+
t
=
−
p
r+s+t=−p, the sum of the products of the roots two at a time 
r
s
+
r
t
+
s
t
=
q
rs+rt+st=q, and the product of the roots 
r
s
t
=
−
r
rst=−r.

so, in our case:

- 
r
+
s
+
t
=
a
+
b
+
c
r+s+t=a+b+c

- 
r
s
+
r
t
+
s
t
=
a
b
+
a
c
+
b
c
rs+rt+st=ab+ac+bc

- 
r
s
t
=
a
b
c
+
1
3
rst=abc+ 
3
1
​
 

now, the problem asks for 
r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
r 
3
 +s 
3
 +t 
3
 . i recall that there's a formula for the sum of cubes of roots in terms of the roots themselves and their products.

the formula is:

r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
=
(
r
+
s
+
t
)
3
−
3
(
r
+
s
+
t
)
(
r
s
+
r
t
+
s
t
)
+
3
r
s
t
r 
3
 +s 
3
 +t 
3
 =(r+s+t) 
3
 −3(r+s+t)(rs+rt+st)+3rst
so, plugging in the values we have:

r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
=
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
−
3
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
(
a
b
+
a
c
+
b
c
)
+
3
(
a
b
c
+
1
3
)
r 
3
 +s 
3
 +t 
3
 =(a+b+c) 
3
 −3(a+b+c)(ab+ac+bc)+3(abc+ 
3
1
​
 )
now, let's compute each part step by step.

first, compute 
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
(a+b+c) 
3
 :

(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
=
a
3
+
b
3
+
c
3
+
3
(
a
+
b
)
(
a
+
c
)
(
b
+
c
)
−
3
a
b
c
(a+b+c) 
3
 =a 
3
 +b 
3
 +c 
3
 +3(a+b)(a+c)(b+c)−3abc
wait, that's getting complicated. maybe there's a better way to expand 
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
(a+b+c) 
3
 .

actually, the standard expansion is:

(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
=
a
3
+
b
3
+
c
3
+
3
(
a
+
b
)
(
a
+
c
)
(
b
+
c
)
(a+b+c) 
3
 =a 
3
 +b 
3
 +c 
3
 +3(a+b)(a+c)(b+c)
but that still seems messy. perhaps i should use the formula for the cube of a sum:

(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
=
a
3
+
b
3
+
c
3
+
3
(
a
+
b
)
(
a
+
c
)
(
b
+
c
)
−
3
a
b
c
(a+b+c) 
3
 =a 
3
 +b 
3
 +c 
3
 +3(a+b)(a+c)(b+c)−3abc
hmm, i'm getting confused. maybe i should recall the general expansion:

(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
=
a
3
+
b
3
+
c
3
+
3
(
a
2
b
+
a
2
c
+
a
b
2
+
b
2
c
+
a
c
2
+
b
c
2
)
+
6
a
b
c
(a+b+c) 
3
 =a 
3
 +b 
3
 +c 
3
 +3(a 
2
 b+a 
2
 c+ab 
2
 +b 
2
 c+ac 
2
 +bc 
2
 )+6abc
that seems too complicated for what i need. maybe there's a better approach.

wait a minute, since 
a
=
13
3
a= 
3
  
13
​
 , 
b
=
53
3
b= 
3
  
53
​
 , and 
c
=
103
3
c= 
3
  
103
​
 , then 
a
3
=
13
a 
3
 =13, 
b
3
=
53
b 
3
 =53, and 
c
3
=
103
c 
3
 =103. that might be useful.

let me see if i can express 
r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
r 
3
 +s 
3
 +t 
3
  in terms of these known quantities.

alternatively, perhaps there's a way to relate the sum of the cubes of the roots to the coefficients of the polynomial.

wait, another thought: if 
r
,
s
,
t
r,s,t are roots of the equation, then 
r
3
r 
3
 , 
s
3
s 
3
 , 
t
3
t 
3
  might satisfy some relation based on the original equation.

but that seems too vague. let me get back to the formula i had earlier:

r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
=
(
r
+
s
+
t
)
3
−
3
(
r
+
s
+
t
)
(
r
s
+
r
t
+
s
t
)
+
3
r
s
t
r 
3
 +s 
3
 +t 
3
 =(r+s+t) 
3
 −3(r+s+t)(rs+rt+st)+3rst
i can plug in the known sums:

- 
r
+
s
+
t
=
a
+
b
+
c
r+s+t=a+b+c

- 
r
s
+
r
t
+
s
t
=
a
b
+
a
c
+
b
c
rs+rt+st=ab+ac+bc

- 
r
s
t
=
a
b
c
+
1
3
rst=abc+ 
3
1
​
 

so, plugging these in:

r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
=
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
−
3
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
(
a
b
+
a
c
+
b
c
)
+
3
(
a
b
c
+
1
3
)
r 
3
 +s 
3
 +t 
3
 =(a+b+c) 
3
 −3(a+b+c)(ab+ac+bc)+3(abc+ 
3
1
​
 )
now, i need to compute 
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
(a+b+c) 
3
  and 
3
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
(
a
b
+
a
c
+
b
c
)
3(a+b+c)(ab+ac+bc).

let's first compute 
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
(a+b+c) 
3
 :

(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
=
a
3
+
b
3
+
c
3
+
3
(
a
+
b
)
(
a
+
c
)
(
b
+
c
)
(a+b+c) 
3
 =a 
3
 +b 
3
 +c 
3
 +3(a+b)(a+c)(b+c)
but again, this seems too complicated. maybe there's a better way to handle this.

wait, perhaps i can consider the original equation:

(
x
−
a
)
(
x
−
b
)
(
x
−
c
)
=
1
3
(x−a)(x−b)(x−c)= 
3
1
​
 
if 
r
,
s
,
t
r,s,t are the roots, then they satisfy:

(
r
−
a
)
(
r
−
b
)
(
r
−
c
)
=
1
3
(r−a)(r−b)(r−c)= 
3
1
​
 
(
s
−
a
)
(
s
−
b
)
(
s
−
c
)
=
1
3
(s−a)(s−b)(s−c)= 
3
1
​
 
(
t
−
a
)
(
t
−
b
)
(
t
−
c
)
=
1
3
(t−a)(t−b)(t−c)= 
3
1
​
 
i wonder if there's a way to relate 
r
3
r 
3
 , 
s
3
s 
3
 , and 
t
3
t 
3
  directly from here.

alternatively, maybe i should consider expressing the cubic equation in terms of 
x
3
x 
3
 .

let me think differently. since 
a
=
13
3
a= 
3
  
13
​
 , 
b
=
53
3
b= 
3
  
53
​
 , and 
c
=
103
3
c= 
3
  
103
​
 , then 
a
3
=
13
a 
3
 =13, 
b
3
=
53
b 
3
 =53, and 
c
3
=
103
c 
3
 =103.

i need to find 
r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
r 
3
 +s 
3
 +t 
3
 . maybe there's a way to express 
r
3
r 
3
  in terms of 
r
r, and similarly for 
s
3
s 
3
  and 
t
3
t 
3
 , using the original equation.

from the original equation:

(
r
−
a
)
(
r
−
b
)
(
r
−
c
)
=
1
3
(r−a)(r−b)(r−c)= 
3
1
​
 
let's expand the left side for 
r
r:

r
3
−
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
r
2
+
(
a
b
+

)
r
−
a
b
c
=
1
3
r 
3
 −(a+b+c)r 
2
 +(ab+ac+bc)r−abc= 
3
1
​
 
then, rearranged:

r
3
=
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
r
2
−
(
a
b
+
a
c
+

r

c
+
1
3
r 
3
 =(a+b+c)r 
2
 −(ab+ac+bc)r+abc+ 
3
1
​
 
similarly, for 
s
s and 
t
t, we have:

s
3
=
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
s
2
−
(

​
 
t

=

+
1
3
t 
3
 =(a+b+c)t 
2
 −(ab+ac+bc)t+abc+

​
 
now, if i add these three equations together:

r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
=
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
(
r

)
−
(

a

r

 +t 
3
 =(a+b+c)(r 
2
 +s 
2
 +t 
2
 )−(ab+ac+bc)(r+s+t)+3abc+1
wait, where did the 1 come from? it should be 
3
×
1
3
=
1
3× 
3
1
​
 =1.

so, 
r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
=
(
a

b

c
)
(
r
2

)
−

3
 =(a+b+c)(r 
2

2

2
 )−(ab+ac+bc)(r+s+t)+3abc+1

hmm, but i still have 
r
2
+
s
2
+
t
2
r 
2
 +s 
2
 +t 
2
  in there, which i don't know yet. maybe i can find an expression for 
r
2
+
s
2
+
t
2
r 
2
 +s 
2
 +t 
2
  in terms of the sums i already have.

i know that:

r

s

t

=
(

r 
2
 +s 
2
 +t 
2
 =(r+s+t)

 −2(rs+rt+st)
so, plugging in:

r

2
=
(

2
−

r

2
 =(a+b+c)

 −2(ab+ac+bc)
now, plug this back into the expression for 
r

r

let's expand this:

wait a minute, this looks familiar. it matches the earlier formula i had for 
r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
r

so, now i need to compute

given that

a=

 , 
b

b=

 , and 
c
=
103
3
c= 
3
  
103
​
 , and knowing that 
a
3
=
13
a 
3
 =13, 
b
3
=
53
b 
3
 =53, and 
c
3
=
103
c 
3
 =103, maybe there's a relationship or simplification i can use here.

alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to approach this problem altogether.

let me consider that 
r
,
s
,
t
r,s,t are roots of the equation:

(
x
−
a
)
(
x
−
b
)
(
x
−
c
)
=
1
3
(x−a)(x−b)(x−c)= 
3
1
​
 
which can be rewritten as:

(
x
−
a
)
(
x
−
b
)
(
x
−
c
)
−
1
3
=
0
(x−a)(x−b)(x−c)− 
3
1
​
 =0
so, the cubic equation is:

x
3
−
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
x
2
+
(
a
b
+
a
c
+
b
c
)
x
−
(
a
b
c
+
1
3
)
=
0
x 
3
 −(a+b+c)x 
2
 +(ab+ac+bc)x−(abc+ 
3
1
​
 )=0
now, in general, for a cubic equation 
x
3
+
p
x
2
+
q
x
+
r
=
0
x 
3
 +px 
2
 +qx+r=0, the sum of the roots is 
−
p
−p, the sum of the products of roots two at a time is 
q
q, and the product of the roots is 
−
r
−r.

in our case:

- sum of roots: 
r
+
s
+
t
=
a
+
b
+
c
r+s+t=a+b+c

- sum of products two at a time: 
r
s
+
r
t
+
s
t
=
a
b
+
a
c
+
b
c
rs+rt+st=ab+ac+bc

- product of roots: 
r
s
t
=
a
b
c
+
1
3
rst=abc+ 
3
1
​
 

now, i need to find 
r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
r 
3
 +s 
3
 +t 
3
 . there is a formula that relates the sum of cubes of the roots to the sums and products of the roots.

the formula is:

r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
=
(
r
+
s
+
t
)
3
−
3
(
r
+
s
+
t
)
(
r
s
+
r
t
+
s
t
)
+
3
r
s
t
r 
3
 +s 
3
 +t 
3
 =(r+s+t) 
3
 −3(r+s+t)(rs+rt+st)+3rst
so, plugging in the known sums:

r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
=
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
−
3
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
(
a
b
+
a
c
+
b
c
)
+
3
(
a
b
c
+
1
3
)
r 
3
 +s 
3
 +t 
3
 =(a+b+c) 
3
 −3(a+b+c)(ab+ac+bc)+3(abc+ 
3
1
​
 )
now, this seems like a manageable expression. let's compute each part step by step.

first, compute 
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
(a+b+c) 
3
 :

(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
=
a
3
+
b
3
+
c
3
+
3
(
a
+
b
)
(
a
+
c
)
(
b
+
c
)
−
3
a
b
c
(a+b+c) 
3
 =a 
3
 +b 
3
 +c 
3
 +3(a+b)(a+c)(b+c)−3abc
wait, that doesn't seem right. let me recall the correct expansion for 
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
(a+b+c) 
3
 :

(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
=
a
3
+
b
3
+
c
3
+
3
(
a
+
b
)
(
a
+
c
)
(
b
+
c
)
−
3
a
b
c
(a+b+c) 
3
 =a 
3
 +b 
3
 +c 
3
 +3(a+b)(a+c)(b+c)−3abc
actually, no, that's not correct. the correct expansion is:

(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
=
a
3
+
b
3
+
c
3
+
3
(
a
2
b
+
a
2
c
+
a
b
2
+
b
2
c
+
a
c
2
+
b
c
2
)
+
6
a
b
c
(a+b+c) 
3
 =a 
3
 +b 
3
 +c 
3
 +3(a 
2
 b+a 
2
 c+ab 
2
 +b 
2
 c+ac 
2
 +bc 
2
 )+6abc
this is getting too complicated. maybe there's a better approach.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the fact that 
a
3
=
13
a 
3
 =13, 
b
3
=
53
b 
3
 =53, and 
c
3
=
103
c 
3
 =103, and see if there's a way to express 
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
(a+b+c) 
3
  in terms of these.

let me compute 
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
(a+b+c) 
3
  using the known values:

(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
=
a
3
+
b
3
+
c
3
+
3
(
a
+
b
)
(
a
+
c
)
(
b
+
c
)
−
3
a
b
c
(a+b+c) 
3
 =a 
3
 +b 
3
 +c 
3
 +3(a+b)(a+c)(b+c)−3abc
but again, this seems messy. maybe i should look for a different strategy.

wait, perhaps i can consider the identity for the sum of cubes:

r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
−
3
r
s
t
=
(
r
+
s
+
t
)
(
r
2
+
s
2
+
t
2
−
r
s
−
r
t
−
s
t
)
r 
3
 +s 
3
 +t 
3
 −3rst=(r+s+t)(r 
2
 +s 
2
 +t 
2
 −rs−rt−st)
but i'm not sure if that helps directly.

alternatively, maybe i can use the fact that 
r
,
s
,
t
r,s,t satisfy the original equation to find an expression for 
r
3
r 
3
 , and similarly for 
s
3
s 
3
  and 
t
3
t 
3
 , and then sum them up.

from the original equation:

(
r
−
a
)
(
r
−
b
)
(
r
−
c
)
=
1
3
(r−a)(r−b)(r−c)= 
3
1
​
 
expanding the left side:

r
3
−
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
r
2
+
(
a
b
+
a
c
+
b
c
)
r
−
a
b
c
=
1
3
r 
3
 −(a+b+c)r 
2
 +(ab+ac+bc)r−abc= 
3
1
​
 
so, rearranged:

r
3
=
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
r
2
−
(
a
b
+
a
c
+
b
c
)
r
+
a
b
c
+
1
3
r 
3
 =(a+b+c)r 
2
 −(ab+ac+bc)r+abc+ 
3
1
​
 
similarly:

s
3
=
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
s
2
−
(
a
b
+
a
c
+
b
c
)
s
+
a
b
c
+
1
3
s 
3
 =(a+b+c)s 
2
 −(ab+ac+bc)s+abc+ 
3
1
​
 
t
3
=
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
t
2
−
(
a
b
+
a
c
+
b
c
)
t
+
a
b
c
+
1
3
t 
3
 =(a+b+c)t 
2
 −(ab+ac+bc)t+abc+ 
3
1
​
 
now, if i add these three equations:

r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
=
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
(
r
2
+
s
2
+
t
2
)
−
(
a
b
+
a
c
+
b
c
)
(
r
+
s
+
t
)
+
3
a
b
c
+
1
r 
3
 +s 
3
 +t 
3
 =(a+b+c)(r 
2
 +s 
2
 +t 
2
 )−(ab+ac+bc)(r+s+t)+3abc+1
but i still have 
r
2
+
s
2
+
t
2
r 
2
 +s 
2
 +t 
2
  in there, which i don't know yet. maybe i can find an expression for 
r
2
+
s
2
+
t
2
r 
2
 +s 
2
 +t 
2
  in terms of the sums i already have.

i know that:

r
2
+
s
2
+
t
2
=
(
r
+
s
+
t
)
2
−
2
(
r
s
+
r
t
+
s
t
)
r 
2
 +s 
2
 +t 
2
 =(r+s+t) 
2
 −2(rs+rt+st)
so, plugging in the known sums:

r
2
+
s
2
+
t
2
=
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
2
−
2
(
a

+
b
c
)
r 
2
 +s 
2
 +t 
2
 =(a+b+c) 
2
 −2(ab+ac+bc)
now, plugging this back into the expression for 
r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
r 
3
 +s 
3
 +t 
3
 :

r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
=
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
(
(
a
+

)
2
−
2
(
a

)
)
−
(
a

)
(
a

+
3
a
b
c

1
r

3
 +t 
3
 =(a+b+c)((a+b+c) 
2
 −2(ab+ac+bc))−(ab+ac+bc)(a+b+c)+3abc+1
let's expand this:

r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
=
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
−
2
(
a

)
(
a

a

b
c
)
−
(
a
b

a

+
b
c
)
(
a

b

c
)
+
3
a
b
c
+
1
r 
3
 +s 
3
 +t 
3
 =(a+b+c) 
3
 −2(a+b+c)(ab+ac+bc)−(ab+ac+bc)(a+b+c)+3abc+1
=
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
−
3
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
(
a

c
)
+
3
a
b
c
+
1
=(a+b+c) 
3
 −3(a+b+c)(ab+ac+bc)+3abc+1
now, this matches the earlier formula i had for 
r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
r 
3
 +s 
3
 +t 
3
 .

so, to proceed, i need to compute 
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
−
3
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
(
a
b
+
a
c
+
b
c
)
+
3
a
b
c
+
1
(a+b+c) 
3
 −3(a+b+c)(ab+ac+bc)+3abc+1.

given that 
a
=
13
3
a= 
3
  
13
​
 , 
b
=
53
3
b= 
3
  
53
​
 , and 
c
=
103
3
c= 
3
  
103
​
 , and knowing that 
a
3
=
13
a 
3
 =13, 
b
3
=
53
b 
3
 =53, and 
c
3
=
103
c 
3
 =103, maybe there's a way to simplify this expression.

let me consider the expression 
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
−
3
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
(
a
b
+
a
c
+
b
c
)
+
3
a
b
c
(a+b+c) 
3
 −3(a+b+c)(ab+ac+bc)+3abc.

this looks familiar; it resembles the expansion of 
a
3
+
b
3
+
c
3
−
3
a
b
c
a 
3
 +b 
3
 +c 
3
 −3abc, which is equal to 
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
(
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
−
a
b
−
a
c
−
b
c
)
(a+b+c)(a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 −ab−ac−bc).

wait, actually, the expression 
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
−
3
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
(
a
b
+
a
c
+
b
c
)
+
3
a
b
c
(a+b+c) 
3
 −3(a+b+c)(ab+ac+bc)+3abc simplifies to 
a
3
+
b
3
+
c
3
a 
3
 +b 
3
 +c 
3
 .

let me verify that:

(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
−
3
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
(
a
b
+
a
c
+
b
c
)
+
3
a
b
c
=
a
3
+
b
3
+
c
3
(a+b+c) 
3
 −3(a+b+c)(ab+ac+bc)+3abc=a 
3
 +b 
3
 +c 
3
 
yes, that's correct. so, the entire expression for 
r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
r 
3
 +s 
3
 +t 
3
  simplifies to:

r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
=
a
3
+
b
3
+
c
3
+
1
r 
3
 +s 
3
 +t 
3
 =a 
3
 +b 
3
 +c 
3
 +1
since 
a
3
=
13
a 
3
 =13, 
b
3
=
53
b 
3
 =53, and 
c
3
=
103
c 
3
 =103, we have:

r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
=
13
+
53
+
103
+
1
=
170
r 
3
 +s 
3
 +t 
3
 =13+53+103+1=170
wait a second, that seems too straightforward. did i miss something?

let me double-check the simplification:

(
a
+
b
+
c
)
3
−
3
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
(
a
b
+
a
c
+
b
c
)
+
3
a
b
c
=
a
3
+
b
3
+
c
3
(a+b+c) 
3
 −3(a+b+c)(ab+ac+bc)+3abc=a 
3
 +b 
3
 +c 
3
 
yes, that's correct. therefore, 
r
3
+
s
3
+
t
3
=
a
3
+
b
3
+
c
3
+
1
=
13
+
53
+
103
+
1
=
170
r 
3
 +s 
3
 +t 
3
 =a 
3
 +b 
3
 +c 
3
 +1=13+53+103+1=170.

so, the final answer should be 
170
170
​
 .

**final answer**

170
170
