Answer: To determine how much tim should invest now to have \$60,000 in 5 years with a 7% annual interest rate compounded quarterly, we use the compound interest formula:

\[ a = p \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} \]

where:
- \( a = 60,000 \)
- \( r = 0.07 \)
- \( n = 4 \)
- \( t = 5 \)

we need to solve for \( p \):

\[ p = \frac{a}{\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}} \]

substituting the known values:

\[ p = \frac{60,000}{\left(1 + \frac{0.07}{4}\right)^{4 \times 5}} \]

first, calculate \( \frac{0.07}{4} \):

\[ \frac{0.07}{4} = 0.0175 \]

so:

\[ p = \frac{60,000}{(1.0175)^{20}} \]

using a calculator to find \( (1.0175)^{20} \):

\[ (1.0175)^{20} \approx 1.414778 \]

then:

\[ p = \frac{60,000}{1.414778} \approx 42,424 \]

therefore, tim should invest approximately:

\boxed{42424}
