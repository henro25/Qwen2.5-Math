Reasoning: So i need to figure out how much tim should invest now if he wants to have \$60,000 in 5 years, with the bank offering a 7% annual interest rate, compounded quarterly. okay, let's break this down.

first, i know that compound interest means that the interest is added to the principal multiple times over the investment period, and then interest is calculated on the new amount. since it's compounded quarterly, that means it's compounded four times a year.

the formula for compound interest is:

a
=
p
(
1
+
r
n
)
n
t
a=p(1+ 
n
r
​
 ) 
nt
 
where:

- 
a
a is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.

- 
p
p is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).

- 
r
r is the annual interest rate (decimal).

- 
n
n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.

- 
t
t is the time the money is invested for in years.

in this problem:

- 
a
=
$
60
,
000
a=$60,000

- 
r
=
7
%
=
0.07
r=7%=0.07

- 
n
=
4
n=4 (since it's compounded quarterly)

- 
t
=
5
t=5 years

but wait, we need to solve for 
p
p, not 
a
a. so i should rearrange the formula to solve for 
p
p.

starting with:

a
=
p
(
1
+
r
n
)
n
t
a=p(1+ 
n
r
​
 ) 
nt
 
to solve for 
p
p, divide both sides by 
(
1
+
r
n
)
n
t
(1+ 
n
r
​
 ) 
nt
 :

p
=
a
(
1
+
r
n
)
n
t
p= 
(1+ 
n
r
​
 ) 
nt
 
a
​
 
now plug in the known values:

p
=
60
,
000
(
1
+
0.07
4
)
4
×
5
p= 
(1+ 
4
0.07
​
 ) 
4×5
 
60,000
​
 
first, calculate 
0.07

4
0.07
​
 :

0.07
4
=
0.0175
4
0.07
​
 =0.0175
so:

p
=
60
,
000
(
1
+
0.0175
)
20
p= 
(1+0.0175) 
20
 
60,000
​
 
now, calculate 
1
+
0.0175
=
1.0175
1+0.0175=1.0175

so:

p
=
60
,
000
(
1.0175
)
20
p= 
(1.0175) 
20
 
60,000
​
 
i need to calculate 
(
1.0175
)
20
(1.0175) 
20
 . this might be a bit tricky without a calculator, but i can use logarithms or recall that 
(
1
+
r
)
n
(1+r) 
n
  can be approximated using the rule of 72, but for precision, i'll use the formula directly.

alternatively, i can use the natural exponential function. let's see.

first, calculate the exponent:

ln
⁡
(
1.017
5
20
)
=
20
×
ln
⁡
(
1.0175
)
ln(1.0175 
20
 )=20×ln(1.0175)
i know that 
ln
⁡
(
1.0175
)
ln(1.0175) is approximately 0.01735 (since 
ln
⁡
(
1
+
x
)
≈
x
ln(1+x)≈x for small x).

so:

20
×
0.01735
=
0.347
20×0.01735=0.347
then:

1.017
5
20
=
e
0.347
1.0175 
20
 =e 
0.347
 
and 
e
0.347
e 
0.347
  is approximately 1.414 (since 
e
0.3466
≈
1.414
e 
0.3466
 ≈1.414).

wait, actually, i think i need a more accurate calculation here. let me check.

alternatively, i can calculate 
1.017

1.0175

  step by step.

let me compute

\[ 1.03530625 \times 1.03530625 = 1.072275 \] (approx)

then

1.072275

so, 
(
1.0175
)
20
≈
1.417
(1.0175) 
20
 ≈1.417

now, plug this back into the equation for 
p
p:

p
=
60
,
000
1.417
p= 
1.417
60,000

calculating this:

60
,
000
÷
1.417
≈
42
,
350
60,000÷1.417≈42,350
so, tim should invest approximately \$42,350.

but wait, the problem asks to the nearest dollar, so \$42,350 is already to the nearest dollar.

let me double-check my calculations to ensure accuracy.

first, confirm 
n
=
4
n=4 for quarterly compounding, which is correct.

next, confirm the formula rearrangement:

p
=
a
(
1
+
r
n
)
n
t
p= 
(1+ 
n
r
​
 )

yes, that seems right.

then, 
0.07

0.07

 =0.0175, correct.

n
t

nt=4×5=20, correct.

calculating 
1.017
5
20
1.0175 
20
 , my step-by-step multiplication gave approximately 1.417.

alternatively, using a calculator for better precision:

calculate

ln(1.0175):

ln

ln(1.0175)≈0.01739
so:

20
×
0.01739
=
0.3478
20×0.01739=0.3478
then:

e
0.3478

e 
0.3478
 ≈1.415
so, more accurately, 
1.017
5
20
≈
1.415
1.0175 
20
 ≈1.415

therefore:

p

000
1.415
≈
42
,
424
p= 
1.415
60,000
​
 ≈42,424
wait, that's different from my previous estimate.

let me calculate 
60
,
000
÷
1.415
60,000÷1.415:

60
,
000
÷
1.415
≈
42
,
424
60,000÷1.415≈42,424
so, perhaps my earlier multiplication was a bit off.

alternatively, use a calculator for precise calculation:

first, calculate

1.149

then, 
1.017

×
1.072275
=
1.417
1.0175 
20
 =1.3213×1.072275=1.417

wait, that brings me back to 1.417.

but the logarithmic method suggested 1.415.

maybe it's around 1.416.

in any case, for practical purposes, let's use 1.415.

therefore:

p
=
60
,
000
1.415
≈
42
,
424
p= 
1.415
60,000
​
 ≈42,424
so, to the nearest dollar, tim should invest \$42,424.

but to ensure accuracy, perhaps i should use the formula in reverse.

alternatively, use the present value formula.

so,

therefore,

p=60,000/1.415≈42,424

alternatively, using a calculator directly:

424
p=60,000/1.414778≈42,424

so, the investment should be approximately \$42,424.

but to the nearest dollar, that's \$42,424.

alternatively, perhaps rounding differently, but since the question asks to the nearest dollar, \$42,424 is acceptable.

alternatively, maybe it's better to use more decimal places in the calculation.
