Answer: Given two two-digit positive integers \( a \) and \( b \), we need to find the smaller of the two integers such that the average of \( a \) and \( b \) is equal to the decimal number obtained by writing one of the integers before the decimal point and the other after the decimal point.

we have two possible equations based on the problem statement:

1. \(\frac{a + b}{2} = a + \frac{b}{100}\)
2. \(\frac{a + b}{2} = b + \frac{a}{100}\)

### solving the first equation:
\[
\frac{a + b}{2} = a + \frac{b}{100}
\]
multiply both sides by 2:
\[
a + b = 2a + \frac{2b}{100}
\]
simplify:
\[
a + b = 2a + \frac{b}{50}
\]
subtract \( a \) from both sides:
\[
b = a + \frac{b}{50}
\]
subtract \(\frac{b}{50}\) from both sides:
\[
b - \frac{b}{50} = a
\]
factor \( b \):
\[
b \left(1 - \frac{1}{50}\right) = a
\]
\[
b \left(\frac{49}{50}\right) = a
\]
thus, \( a = \frac{49}{50} b \). since \( a \) and \( b \) are integers, \( b \) must be a multiple of 50. the only two-digit multiple of 50 is 50, giving \( a = 49 \).

### solving the second equation:
\[
\frac{a + b}{2} = b + \frac{a}{100}
\]
multiply both sides by 2:
\[
a + b = 2b + \frac{2a}{100}
\]
simplify:
\[
a + b = 2b + \frac{a}{50}
\]
subtract \( a/50 \) from both sides:
\[
a - \frac{a}{50} + b = 2b
\]
factor \( a \):
\[
a \left(1 - \frac{1}{50}\right) + b = 2b
\]
\[
a \left(\frac{49}{50}\right) + b = 2b
\]
subtract \( b \) from both sides:
\[
a \left(\frac{49}{50}\right) = b
\]
thus, \( b = \frac{49}{50} a \). since \( a \) and \( b \) are integers, \( a \) must be a multiple of 50. the only two-digit multiple of 50 is 50, giving \( b = 49 \).

### conclusion:
the possible pairs are \( (a, b) = (49, 50) \) and \( (a, b) = (50, 49) \). in both cases, the smaller number is 49.

therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{49}
\]
