Reasoning: I've got this problem here, and i need to find the smaller of two two-digit positive integers based on the given condition. let me try to understand what it's asking.

so, there are two two-digit numbers, let's call them a and b. the average of these two numbers is equal to a decimal number formed by placing one of the numbers before the decimal point and the other after it. i need to find the smaller of these two numbers.

first, i need to express this condition mathematically. the average of a and b is (a + b)/2.

now, the decimal number formed by placing one number before the decimal and the other after it. let's think about this. if i place a before the decimal and b after, the number would be a.b, where b is a two-digit number. but wait, b is a two-digit number, so actually, it's a + b/100.

similarly, if i place b before the decimal and a after, it would be b + a/100.

so, the condition is that the average of a and b equals either a + b/100 or b + a/100.

but actually, the problem says "writing one of the two-digit integers before the decimal point and the other two-digit integer after the decimal point." it doesn't specify which one is before or after, so i need to consider both possibilities.

therefore, i have two equations:

1. (a + b)/2 = a + b/100

2. (a + b)/2 = b + a/100

i need to solve these equations to find possible values for a and b.

let me start with the first equation:

(a + b)/2 = a + b/100

multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:

a + b = 2a + 2b/100

simplify the right side:

a + b = 2a + (2b)/100

let me write 2b/100 as b/50:

a + b = 2a + b/50

now, subtract a from both sides:

b = a + b/50

subtract b/50 from both sides:

b - b/50 = a

factor b:

b(1 - 1/50) = a

calculate 1 - 1/50:

1 - 1/50 = 49/50

so, a = b*(49/50)

this implies that a is 49/50 of b.

but a and b are both two-digit integers, so a and b must be integers, and a must be an integer multiple of 49/50 of b.

hmm, 49 and 50 are co-prime, so for a to be an integer, b must be a multiple of 50.

but b is a two-digit integer, so possible values for b are 50 and 100, but 100 is not a two-digit number, so b must be 50.

then, a = (49/50)*50 = 49.

so, one possible pair is a=49 and b=50.

now, let's check if this satisfies the original condition.

average of 49 and 50 is (49 + 50)/2 = 49.5

now, writing one number before the decimal and the other after: 49.50 or 50.49.

wait, but 49.50 is essentially 49.5, which matches the average.

so, this seems to work.

but i should also check the second equation:

(a + b)/2 = b + a/100

again, plug in a and b.

first, using a=49 and b=50:

(49 + 50)/2 = 49.5

and b + a/100 = 50 + 49/100 = 50.49

but 49.5 is not equal to 50.49, so this doesn't hold for the second equation.

so, in this case, only the first equation holds.

but maybe there are other pairs that satisfy the second equation.

let's try solving the second equation:

(a + b)/2 = b + a/100

multiply both sides by 2:

a + b = 2b + 2a/100

simplify:

a + b = 2b + (2a)/100

again, 2a/100 is a/50:

a + b = 2b + a/50

subtract a/50 from both sides:

a - a/50 + b = 2b

factor a:

a(1 - 1/50) + b = 2b

which is:

a(49/50) + b = 2b

subtract b from both sides:

a(49/50) = b

so, b = (49/50)a

similarly, since a and b are integers, a must be a multiple of 50 for b to be an integer, but a is a two-digit integer, so a could be 50, then b = 49.

wait, that's the same pair as before, just swapped.

so, a=50 and b=49.

but earlier, when a=50 and b=49, checking the first equation:

(50 + 49)/2 = 49.5

and writing a before decimal and b after: 50.49

but 49.5 ≠ 50.49, so only the second equation holds for a=50 and b=49.

wait, no, for the second equation, it's (a + b)/2 = b + a/100

plugging in a=50 and b=49:

(50 + 49)/2 = 49.5

and b + a/100 = 49 + 50/100 = 49.5

so, 49.5 = 49.5, which holds.

so, this pair satisfies the second equation.

therefore, the possible pairs are a=49, b=50 and a=50, b=49.

in both cases, the smaller number is 49.

but let's see if there are any other possible pairs.

is there any other combination where a and b are two-digit integers satisfying one of these equations?

from the first equation, a = (49/50)b, and since a and b are integers, b must be a multiple of 50, but the only two-digit multiple of 50 is 50 itself, giving a=49.

from the second equation, b = (49/50)a, so similarly, a must be a multiple of 50, only possible two-digit value is a=50, giving b=49.

so, the only possible pairs are (49,50) and (50,49), and in both cases, the smaller number is 49.

therefore, the answer is 49.
