Answer: To solve the problem, we first identify the coordinates of the points that form the shaded square and the large square. the large square is divided into a 5x5 grid, with each small square having side length 10 units. the large square has a side length of 40 units, giving it an area of \(40 \times 40 = 1600\) square units.

the shaded square is formed by connecting the points:
- \( r2c2 = (10, 10) \)
- \( r3c3 = (20, 20) \)
- \( r2c4 = (30, 10) \)
- \( r1c3 = (20, 0) \)

we use the shoelace formula to find the area of the shaded square. the shoelace formula is:

\[
\text{area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - y_i x_{i+1}) + (x_n y_1 - y_n x_1) \right|
\]

applying this to the points:
\[
\text{area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| (10 \cdot 20 + 20 \cdot 10 + 30 \cdot 0 + 20 \cdot 10) - (10 \cdot 20 + 20 \cdot 30 + 10 \cdot 20 + 0 \cdot 10) \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left| (200 + 200 + 0 + 200) - (200 + 600 + 200 + 0) \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left| 600 - 1000 \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ square units}
\]

the ratio of the area of the shaded square to the area of the large square is:
\[
\frac{200}{1600} = \frac{1}{8}
\]

thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{8}}
\]
