Problem: Human beings have discovered a habitable planet and soon after, they find 10 more habitable planets. Of these 11, only 5 are deemed ``Earth-like'' in their resources and the rest are deemed ``Mars-like'' since they lack many important resources. Assume that planets like Earth take up 2 units of colonization, while those like Mars take up only 1. If humanity mobilizes 12 total units of colonies, how many different combinations of planets can be occupied if the planets are all different from each other?
