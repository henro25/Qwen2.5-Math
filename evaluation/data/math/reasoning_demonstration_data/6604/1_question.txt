Problem: Every week, Judy goes to the supermarket and buys the following: $5$ carrots at $\$1$ each, $3$ bottles of milk at $\$3$ each, $2$ pineapples at $\$4$ each, $2$ bags of flour at $\$5$ each, and a giant $\$7$ container of ice cream. This week the store has a sale and pineapples are half price. Judy also has a coupon for $\$5$ off any order of $\$25$ or over. How much money does Judy spend on this shopping trip?
