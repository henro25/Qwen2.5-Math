Problem: When the digits in the number $2005$ are reversed we obtain the number $5002,$ and $5002 = a \cdot b \cdot c$, such that $a$, $b$ and $c$ are three distinct primes. How many other positive integers are the products of exactly three distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$ and $p_3$ such that $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = a+b+c$?
