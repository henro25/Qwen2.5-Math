Answer: To compute \(98 \times 102\), we can use the difference of squares formula. 

first, we recognize that:
\[ 98 = 100 - 2 \]
\[ 102 = 100 + 2 \]

using the difference of squares formula \((a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2\), we let \(a = 100\) and \(b = 2\):

\[
(100 - 2)(100 + 2) = 100^2 - 2^2
\]

calculating the squares:

\[
100^2 = 10,000
\]
\[
2^2 = 4
\]

thus:

\[
10,000 - 4 = 9,996
\]

therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{9996}
\]
