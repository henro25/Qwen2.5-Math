Answer: To determine the total distance piravena travels for her complete trip from \( a \) to \( b \), then from \( b \) to \( c \), and finally from \( c \) back to \( a \), we need to sum the distances of each leg of the trip.

given the coordinates:
- \( c = (0, 0) \)
- \( b = (0, 1250) \)
- \( a = (3000, 0) \)

we can calculate the distances as follows:
- distance from \( a \) to \( b \) is given as 3250 km.
- distance from \( b \) to \( c \) is 1250 km (since \( b \) is at (0, 1250) and \( c \) is at (0, 0)).
- distance from \( c \) to \( a \) is 3000 km.

summing these distances:
\[
3250 \, \text{km} + 1250 \, \text{km} + 3000 \, \text{km} = 7500 \, \text{km}
\]

therefore, the total distance piravena travels for her complete trip is:
\[
\boxed{7500}
\]
