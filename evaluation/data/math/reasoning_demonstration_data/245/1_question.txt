Problem: Piravena must make a trip from $A$ to $B$, then from $B$ to $C$, then from $C$ to $A$.  Each of these three parts of the trip is made entirely by bus or entirely by airplane.  The cities form a right-angled triangle as shown, with $C$ a distance of 3000 km from $A$ and with $B$ a distance of 3250 km from $A$. To take a bus, it costs Piravena $\$0.15$ per kilometer. To take an airplane, it costs her a $\$100$ booking fee, plus $\$0.10$ per kilometer. [asy]
