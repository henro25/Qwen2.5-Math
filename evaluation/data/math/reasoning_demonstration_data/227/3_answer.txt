Answer: To find the integer \( n \) such that \( 0 \leq n < 9 \) and \( -1111 \equiv n \pmod{9} \), we can follow these steps:

1. first, find the remainder of \( 1111 \) when divided by 9 by summing its digits:
   \[
   1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
   \]
   thus, \( 1111 \equiv 4 \pmod{9} \).

2. since \( -1111 \equiv -4 \pmod{9} \), we need to convert \(-4\) to a positive equivalent within the range \( 0 \leq n < 9 \):
   \[
   -4 + 9 = 5
   \]
   therefore, \( -1111 \equiv 5 \pmod{9} \).

3. to verify, use the division algorithm for negative numbers:
   \[
   -1111 = 9 \times (-124) + 5
   \]
   this confirms that \( 0 \leq 5 < 9 \).

thus, the integer \( n \) that satisfies the given conditions is \( \boxed{5} \).
