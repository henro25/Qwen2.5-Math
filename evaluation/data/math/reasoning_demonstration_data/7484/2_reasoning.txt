Reasoning: Alright, I need to find the greatest common factor of 32 and 48. Let me think about what that means. The greatest common factor, or GCF, is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find the largest number that can divide both 32 and 48 evenly.

One way to approach this is to list out all the factors of each number and then see which ones they have in common. Factors are numbers that you can multiply together to get another number. So, for 32, what numbers can I multiply to get 32?

Let's see, 1 times 32 is 32, so 1 and 32 are factors. 2 times 16 is 32, so 2 and 16 are factors. 4 times 8 is 32, so 4 and 8 are factors. I don't think there are any more factors for 32. So the factors of 32 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.

Now, let's do the same for 48. 1 times 48 is 48, so 1 and 48 are factors. 2 times 24 is 48, so 2 and 24 are factors. 3 times 16 is 48, so 3 and 16 are factors. 4 times 12 is 48, so 4 and 12 are factors. 6 times 8 is 48, so 6 and 8 are factors. I don't think there are any more factors for 48. So the factors of 48 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 48.

Now, I need to find the common factors between 32 and 48. That means I need to look for numbers that are in both lists. Let's see:

32: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32

48: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48

Looking at these, the common factors are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. So among these, the greatest one is 16. Therefore, the greatest common factor of 32 and 48 is 16.

Wait a minute, is there a better way to do this without listing out all the factors? Maybe I can use prime factorization. Let's try that.

First, I'll find the prime factors of 32. 32 divided by 2 is 16, divided by 2 is 8, divided by 2 is 4, divided by 2 is 2, and divided by 2 is 1. So, 32 is 2 multiplied by itself five times, or 2^5.

Now, for 48. 48 divided by 2 is 24, divided by 2 is 12, divided by 2 is 6, divided by 2 is 3, and 3 is a prime number. So, 48 is 2^4 times 3.

To find the GCF, I take the lowest power of the common prime factors. Both numbers have 2 as a common prime factor. In 32, it's 2^5, and in 48, it's 2^4. So, I take 2^4, which is 16. That matches what I found earlier.

I think this confirms that the greatest common factor is indeed 16.
