Answer: To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 32 and 48:

1. **List the factors:**
   - Factors of 32: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32
   - Factors of 48: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48

2. **Identify common factors:** 1, 2, 4, 8, 16

3. **Determine the greatest common factor:** 16

Alternatively, using **prime factorization:**
   - 32 = 2^5
   - 48 = 2^4 Ã— 3
   - The common prime factor is 2, and the lowest power is 2^4 = 16.

**Answer:** The greatest common factor of 32 and 48 is **16**.
