Reasoning: Alright, so I've got this problem here: "What percent of the prime numbers less than 12 are divisible by 2?" Hmm, okay, let's break this down. I need to find out, among all the prime numbers below 12, how many of them can be divided by 2, and then express that as a percentage.

First things first, what are prime numbers? I remember that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, they can't be divided evenly by any other number except 1 and the number itself.

Now, I need to list out all the prime numbers less than 12. Let's see... Starting from 2: 2 is prime. 3 is prime. 4 is not prime because it's divisible by 2. 5 is prime. 6 is not prime, divisible by 2 and 3. 7 is prime. 8 is not, divisible by 2. 9 is not, divisible by 3. 10 is not, divisible by 2 and 5. 11 is prime. So, the prime numbers less than 12 are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.

Next, I need to find out which of these are divisible by 2. Well, 2 is divisible by 2, obviously. 3 divided by 2 is 1.5, which isn't a whole number, so no. 5 divided by 2 is 2.5, again not a whole number. 7 divided by 2 is 3.5, still not a whole number. 11 divided by 2 is 5.5, not a whole number. So, only 2 is divisible by 2 among the primes less than 12.

Now, to find the percentage, I need to know how many primes there are in total and how many of them are divisible by 2. There are 5 prime numbers less than 12: 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. Only 1 of them (which is 2) is divisible by 2.

So, the percentage would be (number of primes divisible by 2 divided by total number of primes) times 100. That would be (1/5) * 100, which is 20%.

Wait a minute, but 2 is the only even prime number, right? All other prime numbers are odd, which makes sense because any even number greater than 2 is divisible by 2 and hence not prime. So, in this case, since we're dealing with primes less than 12, and 2 is the only even prime, the calculation seems correct.

Just to double-check, let's list the primes again: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. Yep, that's five primes. Only 2 is divisible by 2. So, 1 out of 5, which is indeed 20%.

I think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning.
