Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: 8 tan θ = 3 cos θ, and θ is between 0 and π. i need to find sin θ. alright, let's see how to approach this.

first off, i know that tan θ is sin θ over cos θ. so, maybe i can express everything in terms of sin and cos to make it easier to solve.

let's start by substituting tan θ with sin θ / cos θ in the equation:

8 * (sin θ / cos θ) = 3 cos θ

hmm, that looks manageable. maybe i can multiply both sides by cos θ to eliminate the denominator:

8 sin θ = 3 cos² θ

now, i have 8 sin θ = 3 cos² θ. i need to find sin θ, so perhaps i should express cos² θ in terms of sin θ using the pythagorean identity. i recall that sin² θ + cos² θ = 1, so cos² θ = 1 - sin² θ.

substituting that in:

8 sin θ = 3 (1 - sin² θ)

alright, expanding the right side:

8 sin θ = 3 - 3 sin² θ

now, let's bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:

3 sin² θ + 8 sin θ - 3 = 0

this looks like a standard quadratic equation in terms of sin θ. let's set x = sin θ for simplicity:

3x² + 8x - 3 = 0

to solve for x, i can use the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

here, a = 3, b = 8, and c = -3.

plugging in the values:

x = [-8 ± sqrt((8)² - 4 * 3 * (-3))] / (2 * 3)

x = [-8 ± sqrt(64 + 36)] / 6

x = [-8 ± sqrt(100)] / 6

x = [-8 ± 10] / 6

so, there are two possible solutions:

x = (-8 + 10)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3

and

x = (-8 - 10)/6 = -18/6 = -3

wait a minute, sin θ can't be -3 because its range is between -1 and 1. so, sin θ = 1/3 is the only valid solution.

but i should check if this makes sense in the original equation, just to be sure.

let's find cos θ using sin θ = 1/3.

from sin² θ + cos² θ = 1:

(1/3)² + cos² θ = 1

1/9 + cos² θ = 1

cos² θ = 1 - 1/9 = 8/9

cos θ = ± sqrt(8/9) = ± 2*sqrt(2)/3

now, since 0 < θ < π, cos θ is positive in the first quadrant and negative in the second quadrant. but let's see which one fits with the original equation.

let's plug sin θ = 1/3 and cos θ = 2*sqrt(2)/3 into the original equation:

8 tan θ = 8 * (sin θ / cos θ) = 8 * (1/3) / (2*sqrt(2)/3) = 8 * (1/3) * (3/(2*sqrt(2))) = 8/(2*sqrt(2)) = 4/sqrt(2) = 2*sqrt(2)

and 3 cos θ = 3 * (2*sqrt(2)/3) = 2*sqrt(2)

so, 8 tan θ = 2*sqrt(2) and 3 cos θ = 2*sqrt(2), which matches. so, sin θ = 1/3 is a valid solution.

but what about cos θ being negative? if cos θ = -2*sqrt(2)/3, let's check:

8 tan θ = 8 * (sin θ / cos θ) = 8 * (1/3) / (-2*sqrt(2)/3) = 8/(3) * (3)/(-2*sqrt(2)) = 8/(-2*sqrt(2)) = -4/sqrt(2) = -2*sqrt(2)

and 3 cos θ = 3 * (-2*sqrt(2)/3) = -2*sqrt(2)

so, 8 tan θ = -2*sqrt(2) and 3 cos θ = -2*sqrt(2), which also matches.

wait, so both cos θ positive and negative satisfy the original equation. but θ is between 0 and π, so cos θ is positive in the first quadrant and negative in the second quadrant.

therefore, there are two possible solutions for θ in this interval: one in the first quadrant where sin θ = 1/3 and cos θ = 2*sqrt(2)/3, and another in the second quadrant where sin θ = 1/3 and cos θ = -2*sqrt(2)/3.

however, sin θ is positive in both quadrants, so sin θ = 1/3 is the same in both cases.

therefore, the value of sin θ is 1/3.

wait a minute, but in the second quadrant, sin θ is still positive, and cos θ is negative. but since sin θ is the same in both cases, and the problem asks for sin θ, it's 1/3.

so, the answer should be sin θ = 1/3.
