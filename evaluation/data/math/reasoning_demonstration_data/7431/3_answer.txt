Answer: To find the value of \( a \) that makes the piecewise function \( f(x) \) continuous at \( x = 3 \), we need to ensure that the function meets the conditions of continuity at that point.

the function is defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
3x^2 + 2 & \text{if } x \le 3, \\
ax - 1 & \text{if } x > 3.
\end{cases}
\]

**first condition: \( f(3) \) is defined.**

for \( x = 3 \), we use the first part of the piecewise function:
\[
f(3) = 3(3)^2 + 2 = 27 + 2 = 29.
\]

**second condition: the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 3 exists.**

we need to check both the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit.

left-hand limit:
\[
\lim_{x \to 3^-} f(x) = 3(3)^2 + 2 = 29.
\]

right-hand limit:
\[
\lim_{x \to 3^+} f(x) = a(3) - 1 = 3a - 1.
\]

for the limit to exist at \( x = 3 \), the left-hand limit must equal the right-hand limit:
\[
29 = 3a - 1.
\]

**third condition: the limit as \( x \) approaches 3 equals \( f(3) \).**

we set the right-hand limit equal to \( f(3) \):
\[
3a - 1 = 29.
\]

solving for \( a \):
\[
3a = 30 \implies a = 10.
\]

thus, the value of \( a \) that makes the function continuous at \( x = 3 \) is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
