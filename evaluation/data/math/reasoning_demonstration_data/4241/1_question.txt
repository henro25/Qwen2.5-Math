Problem: Dr. Math's four-digit house number $ABCD$ contains no zeroes and can be split into two different two-digit primes ``$AB$'' and ``$CD$'' where the digits $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ are not necessarily distinct. If each of the two-digit primes is less than 40, how many such house numbers are possible?
