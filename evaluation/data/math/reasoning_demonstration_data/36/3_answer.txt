Answer: To factor the expression \(37a^2 + 111a\), we start by identifying the greatest common factor (gcf) of the coefficients and the variables separately.

1. the coefficients are 37 and 111. since 37 is a prime number and 37 divides 111 (because \(37 \times 3 = 111\)), the gcf of the coefficients is 37.
2. the variables are \(a^2\) and \(a\). the lowest power of \(a\) present in both terms is \(a\).

therefore, the overall gcf of the entire expression is \(37a\).

next, we factor \(37a\) out of each term in the expression:

\[
37a^2 = 37a \times a
\]
\[
111a = 37a \times 3
\]

thus, the expression can be factored as:

\[
37a(a + 3)
\]

to verify, we expand \(37a(a + 3)\):

\[
37a \times a = 37a^2
\]
\[
37a \times 3 = 111a
\]

this matches the original expression, confirming our factoring is correct.

therefore, the fully factored form of the expression is:

\[
\boxed{37a(a + 3)}
\]
