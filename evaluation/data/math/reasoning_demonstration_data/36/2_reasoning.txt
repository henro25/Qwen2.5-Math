Reasoning: So i've got this expression to factor: 
37
a
2
+
111
a
37a 
2
 +111a. alright, let's see how to approach this. factoring is about finding common factors in the terms and pulling them out, right? so, first, i need to look at the coefficients and the variables in each term.

the expression has two terms: 
37
a
2
37a 
2
  and 
111
a
111a. the coefficients are 37 and 111, and the variables are 
a
2
a 
2
  and 
a
a. i should find the greatest common factor (gcf) of the coefficients and the variables separately.

starting with the coefficients: 37 and 111. hmm, 37 is a prime number, isn't it? let me check: 37 divided by 2 is 18.5, not an integer; divided by 3 is about 12.333, also not an integer. so, 37 is prime. now, 111 divided by 37 is 3, because 37 times 3 is 111. so, the gcf of 37 and 111 is 37.

next, the variables: 
a
2
a 
2
  and 
a
a. the lowest power of 
a
a present in both terms is 
a
a, since one term has 
a
2
a 
2
  and the other has 
a
a. so, the gcf for the variables is 
a
a.

therefore, the overall gcf of the entire expression is 
37
a
37a.

now, i need to factor 
37
a
37a out of each term in the expression. let's do that step by step.

first term: 
37
a
2
37a 
2
 . if i factor out 
37
a
37a, i'm left with 
a
a, because 
37
a
×
a
=
37
a
2
37a×a=37a 
2
 .

second term: 
111
a
111a. if i factor out 
37
a
37a, i need to see what's left. so, 
37
a
×
3
=
111
a
37a×3=111a, because 
37
×
3
=
111
37×3=111 and 
a
×
1
=
a
a×1=a.

so, factoring 
37
a
37a out of both terms, the expression becomes:

37
a
(
a
+
3
)
37a(a+3)
let me double-check this by expanding it to make sure it matches the original expression.

expanding 
37
a
(
a
+
3
)
37a(a+3):

37
a
×
a
=
37
a
2
37a×a=37a 
2
 
37
a
×
3
=
111
a
37a×3=111a
so, 
37
a
2
+
111
a
37a 
2
 +111a, which matches the original expression. that means i did it correctly.

just to be thorough, i should consider if there's anything else to factor inside the parentheses. the expression inside the parentheses is 
a
+
3
a+3, which doesn't have any common factors other than 1, and it's a binomial that doesn't factor further over the integers.

therefore, the fully factored form of the expression is 
37
a
(
a
+
3
)
37a(a+3).

**final answer**

37
a
(
a
+
3
)
37a(a+3)
