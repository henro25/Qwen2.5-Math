Answer: Given a right-angled triangle with a 60-degree angle and an inscribed circle of radius 6 cm, we need to find the length of side \(\overline{ab}\) in simplest radical form.

first, we use the formula for the inradius \(r\) of a right-angled triangle:

\[ r = \frac{a + b - c}{2} \]

where \(a\) and \(b\) are the legs, and \(c\) is the hypotenuse. given \(r = 6\) cm, we have:

\[ 6 = \frac{a + b - c}{2} \]
\[ a + b - c = 12 \]

for a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio \(1 : \sqrt{3} : 2\). let the sides be \(a\), \(a\sqrt{3}\), and \(2a\). plugging these into the equation:

\[ a + a\sqrt{3} - 2a = 12 \]
\[ a(\sqrt{3} - 1) = 12 \]
\[ a = \frac{12}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \]
\[ a = \frac{12(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \frac{12(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = 6(\sqrt{3} + 1) \]

the hypotenuse \(c\) is:

\[ c = 2a = 2 \times 6(\sqrt{3} + 1) = 12(\sqrt{3} + 1) \]

thus, the length of \(\overline{ab}\) is:

\[
\boxed{12(\sqrt{3} + 1)}
\]
