Answer: To determine how many integer values of \( n \) satisfy the inequality \( -50 < n^3 < 50 \), we start by finding the approximate cube roots of -50 and 50, which are around -3.684 and 3.684, respectively. this means \( n \) must be an integer between -3 and 3.

we check each integer in this range:

- for \( n = -3 \): \( (-3)^3 = -27 \), which satisfies \( -50 < -27 < 50 \).
- for \( n = -2 \): \( (-2)^3 = -8 \), which satisfies \( -50 < -8 < 50 \).
- for \( n = -1 \): \( (-1)^3 = -1 \), which satisfies \( -50 < -1 < 50 \).
- for \( n = 0 \): \( 0^3 = 0 \), which satisfies \( -50 < 0 < 50 \).
- for \( n = 1 \): \( 1^3 = 1 \), which satisfies \( -50 < 1 < 50 \).
- for \( n = 2 \): \( 2^3 = 8 \), which satisfies \( -50 < 8 < 50 \).
- for \( n = 3 \): \( 3^3 = 27 \), which satisfies \( -50 < 27 < 50 \).

integers outside this range, such as \( n = -4 \) and \( n = 4 \), do not satisfy the inequality because their cubes are outside the range of -50 to 50.

thus, the integer values of \( n \) that satisfy the inequality are -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3, giving us a total of 7 values.

\[
\boxed{7}
