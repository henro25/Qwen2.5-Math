Reasoning: So i need to figure out how many integer values of 
n
n satisfy the inequality 
−
50
<
n
3
<
50
−50<n 
3
 <50. hmm, let's see.

first, i know that 
n
n is an integer, and 
n
3
n 
3
  means 
n
n multiplied by itself three times. so, i need to find all integers 
n
n where the cube of 
n
n is greater than -50 and less than 50.

maybe i should start by finding the cube roots of -50 and 50 to get an idea of the range for 
n
n.

the cube root of -50 is approximately -3.684, and the cube root of 50 is approximately 3.684. so, 
n
3
n 
3
  is between -50 and 50 when 
n
n is between -3.684 and 3.684.

but since 
n
n has to be an integer, i should look for integer values of 
n
n that fall within this range. so, what integers are between -3.684 and 3.684?

well, integers are whole numbers, so starting from the smallest integer greater than -3.684, which is -3, up to the largest integer less than 3.684, which is 3. so, possible integer values for 
n
n are -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3.

let me check each of these to make sure they satisfy the original inequality.

first, 
n
=
−
3
n=−3: 
(
−
3
)
3
=
−
27
(−3) 
3
 =−27. is -27 greater than -50? yes. is -27 less than 50? yes. so, -3 works.

next, 
n
=
−
2
n=−2: 
(
−
2
)
3
=
−
8
(−2) 
3
 =−8. -8 is greater than -50 and less than 50. so, -2 works.

then, 
n
=
−
1
n=−1: 
(
−
1
)
3
=
−
1
(−1) 
3
 =−1. -1 is greater than -50 and less than 50. so, -1 works.

now, 
n
=
0
n=0: 
0
3
=
0
0 
3
 =0. 0 is greater than -50 and less than 50. so, 0 works.

next, 
n
=
1
n=1: 
1
3
=
1
1 
3
 =1. 1 is greater than -50 and less than 50. so, 1 works.

then, 
n
=
2
n=2: 
2
3
=
8
2 
3
 =8. 8 is greater than -50 and less than 50. so, 2 works.

finally, 
n
=
3
n=3: 
3
3
=
27
3 
3
 =27. 27 is greater than -50 and less than 50. so, 3 works.

wait a minute, but earlier i thought about the cube roots being approximately -3.684 and 3.684. but, what if there are integers outside this range that still satisfy the inequality?

let me check 
n
=
−
4
n=−4: 
(
−
4
)
3
=
−
64
(−4) 
3
 =−64. is -64 greater than -50? no, it's -64 < -50, so it doesn't satisfy the inequality.

similarly, 
n
=
4
n=4: 
4
3
=
64
4 
3
 =64. 64 is greater than 50, so it doesn't satisfy the inequality.

okay, so -4 and 4 are out of the range. what about 
n
=
−
5
n=−5: 
(
−
5
)
3
=
−
125
(−5) 
3
 =−125. that's even smaller, so definitely less than -50.

and 
n
=
5
n=5: 
5
3
=
125
5 
3
 =125. that's greater than 50.

so, indeed, only 
n
=
−
3
,
−
2
,
−
1
,
0
,
1
,
2
,
3
n=−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3 satisfy the inequality.

let me count them: that's 7 integer values.

wait, but i should make sure there are no other integers i'm missing. are there any other integers between -3.684 and 3.684 besides -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3?

no, because between -3 and -4, the only integer is -3, and between 3 and 4, it's 3. so, i think i've covered all possible integer values of 
n
n that satisfy 
−
50
<
n
3
<
50
−50<n 
3
 <50.

therefore, the number of integer values of 
n
n that satisfy the inequality is 7.

**final answer**

7
