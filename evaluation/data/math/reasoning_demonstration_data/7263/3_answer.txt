Answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the largest positive integer \( n \) such that \( n! \) can be expressed as the product of \( n - 3 \) consecutive positive integers. we start by understanding the given example: \( 6! = 8 \cdot 9 \cdot 10 \), where \( 6! = 720 \) and the product of 3 consecutive integers \( 8, 9, 10 \) also equals 720.

we generalize this by expressing \( n! \) as the product of \( n - 3 \) consecutive integers starting from \( k \):

\[
n! = k \cdot (k+1) \cdot (k+2) \cdots (k + n - 4)
\]

this can be written using factorials as:

\[
n! = \frac{(k + n - 4)!}{(k - 1)!}
\]

rearranging, we get:

\[
(k + n - 4)! = n! \cdot (k - 1)!
\]

we test specific values of \( n \) to find the largest \( n \) for which this equation holds with integer \( k \).

for \( n = 6 \):
\[
6! = 720 = 8 \cdot 9 \cdot 10
\]
this works with \( k = 8 \).

for \( n = 7 \):
\[
7! = 5040 = 7 \cdot 8 \cdot 9 \cdot 10
\]
this works with \( k = 7 \).

for \( n = 8 \):
\[
8! = 40320
\]
testing possible \( k \) values shows no integer \( k \) satisfies the product of 5 consecutive integers equal to 40320.

for \( n = 9 \):
\[
9! = 362880
\]
testing possible \( k \) values shows no integer \( k \) satisfies the product of 6 consecutive integers equal to 362880.

for \( n = 10 \):
\[
10! = 3628800
\]
testing possible \( k \) values shows no integer \( k \) satisfies the product of 7 consecutive integers equal to 3628800.

thus, the largest \( n \) for which \( n! \) can be expressed as the product of \( n - 3 \) consecutive positive integers is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]
