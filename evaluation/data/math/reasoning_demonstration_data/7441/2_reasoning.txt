Reasoning: So i have this problem: for 
−
25
≤
x
≤
25
−25≤x≤25, find the maximum value of 
25
+
x
+
25
−
x
25+x
​	
 + 
25−x
​	
 . hmm, interesting. i need to find the maximum value of this expression within the given range for 
x
x.

first, i should probably understand the expression better. it’s the sum of two square roots: one involving 
25
+
x
25+x and the other 
25
−
x
25−x. since 
x
x is between -25 and 25, both 
25
+
x
25+x and 
25
−
x
25−x will be non-negative, which means the square roots are real numbers. that’s good because i don’t have to worry about imaginary numbers here.

maybe i can simplify the expression or find a way to maximize it. one approach that comes to mind is to consider the function 
f
(
x
)
=
25
+
x
+
25
−
x
f(x)= 
25+x
​	
 + 
25−x
​	
  and find its maximum value over the interval 
[
−
25
,
25
]
[−25,25].

to find the maximum of a function on a closed interval, i can use calculus: find the critical points by taking the derivative and setting it to zero, then evaluate the function at those points and at the endpoints of the interval.

alright, let’s try that. first, find 
f
′
(
x
)
f 
′
 (x).

f
(
x
)
=
25
+
x
+
25
−
x
f(x)= 
25+x
​	
 + 
25−x
​	
 

the derivative of 
25
+
x
25+x
​	
  with respect to 
x
x is 
1
2
25
+
x
2 
25+x
​	
 
1
​	
 , and the derivative of 
25
−
x
25−x
​	
  is 
−
1
2
25
−
x
2 
25−x
​	
 
−1
​	
 .

so,

f
′
(
x
)
=
1
2
25
+
x
−
1
2
25
−
x
f 
′
 (x)= 
2 
25+x
​	
 
1
​	
 − 
2 
25−x
​	
 
1
​	
 

set 
f
′
(
x
)
=
0
f 
′
 (x)=0 to find critical points:

1
2
25
+
x
−
1
2
25
−
x
=
0
2 
25+x
​	
 
1
​	
 − 
2 
25−x
​	
 
1
​	
 =0

simplify:

1
25
+
x
=
1
25
−
x
25+x
​	
 
1
​	
 = 
25−x
​	
 
1
​	
 

which implies:

25
+
x
=
25
−
x
25+x
​	
 = 
25−x
​	
 

square both sides:

25
+
x
=
25
−
x
25+x=25−x

simplify:

x
=
−
x
x=−x

which means 
x
=
0
x=0

so, the only critical point in the interval is at 
x
=
0
x=0.

now, evaluate 
f
(
x
)
f(x) at 
x
=
0
x=0, 
x
=
−
25
x=−25, and 
x
=
25
x=25:

first, at 
x
=
0
x=0:

f
(
0
)
=
25
+
0
+
25
−
0
=
25
+
25
=
5
+
5
=
10
f(0)= 
25+0
​	
 + 
25−0
​	
 = 
25
​	
 + 
25
​	
 =5+5=10

next, at 
x
=
25
x=25:

f
(
25
)
=
25
+
25
+
25
−
25
=
50
+
0
=
50
+
0
=
50
f(25)= 
25+25
​	
 + 
25−25
​	
 = 
50
​	
 + 
0
​	
 = 
50
​	
 +0= 
50
​	
 

similarly, at 
x
=
−
25
x=−25:

f
(
−
25
)
=
25
−
25
+
25
+
25
=
0
+
50
=
0
+
50
=
50
f(−25)= 
25−25
​	
 + 
25+25
​	
 = 
0
​	
 + 
50
​	
 =0+ 
50
​	
 = 
50
​	
 

now, compare these values:

f
(
0
)
=
10
f(0)=10

f
(
25
)
=
50
≈
7.07
f(25)= 
50
​	
 ≈7.07

f
(
−
25
)
=
50
≈
7.07
f(−25)= 
50
​	
 ≈7.07

so, the maximum value is at 
x
=
0
x=0, and it's 10.

wait a minute, that seems straightforward. but maybe there's another way to confirm this result. perhaps i can consider squaring the expression to make it easier to handle.

let’s consider 
f
(
x
)
=
25
+
x
+
25
−
x
f(x)= 
25+x
​	
 + 
25−x
​	
 . if i square both sides:

f
(
x
)
2
=
(
25
+
x
+
25
−
x
)
2
f(x) 
2
 =( 
25+x
​	
 + 
25−x
​	
 ) 
2
 

expanding the right side:

f
(
x
)
2
=
(
25
+
x
)
+
2
(
25
+
x
)
(
25
−
x
)
+
(
25
−
x
)
f(x) 
2
 =(25+x)+2 
(25+x)(25−x)
​	
 +(25−x)

simplify:

f
(
x
)
2
=
25
+
x
+
25
−
x
+
2
(
25
)
2
−
x
2
f(x) 
2
 =25+x+25−x+2 
(25) 
2
 −x 
2
 
​	
 

which simplifies further to:

f
(
x
)
2
=
50
+
2
625
−
x
2
f(x) 
2
 =50+2 
625−x 
2
 
​	
 

so, 
f
(
x
)
2
=
50
+
2
625
−
x
2
f(x) 
2
 =50+2 
625−x 
2
 
​	
 

now, to maximize 
f
(
x
)
f(x), i need to maximize 
f
(
x
)
2
f(x) 
2
 , since the square function is increasing for non-negative values.

so, maximize 
50
+
2
625
−
x
2
50+2 
625−x 
2
 
​	
 

the term 
625
−
x
2
625−x 
2
  is maximized when 
x
2
x 
2
  is minimized, which occurs at 
x
=
0
x=0.

at 
x
=
0
x=0, 
625
−
x
2
=
625
625−x 
2
 =625, so 
625
=
25
625
​	
 =25, and 
2
×
25
=
50
2×25=50, so 
f
(
x
)
2
=
50
+
50
=
100
f(x) 
2
 =50+50=100, and 
f
(
x
)
=
10
f(x)=10, which matches what i found earlier.

alternatively, when 
x
=
±
25
x=±25, 
625
−
x
2
=
625
−
625
=
0
625−x 
2
 =625−625=0, so 
0
=
0
0
​	
 =0, and 
f
(
x
)
2
=
50
+
0
=
50
f(x) 
2
 =50+0=50, so 
f
(
x
)
=
50
f(x)= 
50
​	
 , again matching previous calculations.

therefore, the maximum value of 
f
(
x
)
f(x) is indeed 10, achieved at 
x
=
0
x=0.

another way to think about this is to consider the symmetry of the function. the expression 
25
+
x
+
25
−
x
25+x
​	
 + 
25−x
​	
  is symmetric around 
x
=
0
x=0, meaning that it has the same value for 
x
x and 
−
x
−x. this suggests that the maximum is likely at 
x
=
0
x=0.

moreover, considering the behavior of the function, as 
∣
x
∣
∣x∣ increases from 0 to 25, one of the square roots increases while the other decreases, but the sum seems to decrease overall, which is consistent with the derivative approach and the earlier calculations.

i could also consider plotting the function to visualize its behavior, but since i don't have graphing tools right now, i'll rely on the analytical methods.

alternatively, i might think about whether there’s a trigonometric substitution that could simplify the expression, but given that the expression involves square roots of linear functions, maybe not necessary here.

perhaps i can also consider the cauchy-schwarz inequality or other inequalities to bound the expression, but since i've already found the maximum via calculus and confirmed it through squaring the expression, it seems sufficient.

wait, maybe i can try to use the am-qm inequality or something similar. let’s see.

the arithmetic mean of 
25
+
x
25+x
​	
  and 
25
−
x
25−x
​	
  is 
25
+
x
+
25
−
x
2
2
25+x
​	
 + 
25−x
​	
 
​	
 , and the quadratic mean is 
25
+
x
+
25
−
x
2
=
50
2
=
25
=
5
2
25+x+25−x
​	
 
​	
 = 
2
50
​	
 
​	
 = 
25
​	
 =5.

by the am-qm inequality, 
25
+
x
+
25
−
x
2
≤
5
2
25+x
​	
 + 
25−x
​	
 
​	
 ≤5, which implies 
25
+
x
+
25
−
x
≤
10
25+x
​	
 + 
25−x
​	
 ≤10, which matches the maximum value i found earlier.

equality in am-qm occurs when 
25
+
x
=
25
−
x
25+x
​	
 = 
25−x
​	
 , which again happens at 
x
=
0
x=0. so this confirms that the maximum is indeed 10 at 
x
=
0
x=0.

this seems pretty solid. i can’t think of any other methods that would give a different result, and all the approaches i’ve tried so far point to the same conclusion.

therefore, the maximum value of 
25
+
x
+
25
−
x
25+x
​	
 + 
25−x
​	
  for 
−
25
≤
x
≤
25
−25≤x≤25 is 10, achieved when 
x
=
0
x=0.

**final answer**

10
