Problem: For a nonnegative integer $n$, let $r_9(n)$ stand for the remainder left when $n$ is divided by $9.$ For example, $r_9(25)=7.$

What is the $22^{\text{nd}}$ entry in an ordered list of all nonnegative integers $n$ that satisfy $$r_9(5n)\le 4~?$$(Note that the first entry in this list is $0$.)
