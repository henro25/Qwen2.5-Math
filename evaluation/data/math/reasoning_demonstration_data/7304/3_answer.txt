Answer: To find the probability that at least one of two fair 6-sided dice shows a 1, we can use the complementary approach.

1. calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice:
   \[
   6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

2. calculate the probability that neither die shows a 1. the probability that one die does not show a 1 is \(\frac{5}{6}\). therefore, the probability that neither die shows a 1 is:
   \[
   \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{36}
   \]

3. the probability that at least one die shows a 1 is the complement of the probability that neither die shows a 1:
   \[
   1 - \frac{25}{36} = \frac{11}{36}
   \]

alternatively, we can directly count the favorable outcomes:
- outcomes where the first die is 1: \((1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\) (6 outcomes)
- outcomes where the second die is 1: \((2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\) (5 outcomes)
- the overlap (both dice are 1): \((1,1)\) (1 outcome)

total unique favorable outcomes:
\[
6 + 5 - 1 = 11
\]

thus, the probability is:
\[
\frac{11}{36}
\]

therefore, the probability that at least one of the two fair 6-sided dice shows a 1 is \(\boxed{\frac{11}{36}}\).
