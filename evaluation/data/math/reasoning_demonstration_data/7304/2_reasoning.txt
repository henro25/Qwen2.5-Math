Reasoning: So i have this probability problem here: "two fair 6-sided dice are rolled. what is the probability that at least one of the dice shows a 1?" alright, let's see how to approach this.

first off, i know that when dealing with probabilities, especially with multiple events, it's often helpful to consider the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes. so, with two dice, each die has 6 faces, right? so, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice is 6 times 6, which is 36. that makes sense because each die is independent of the other.

now, the problem is asking for the probability that at least one die shows a 1. so, "at least one" means either one die is a 1 or both dice are 1s. hmm, thinking about it, it might be easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and then subtract it from 1. the complementary event here would be that neither die shows a 1, meaning both dice show numbers other than 1.

let me try that approach. so, the probability that one die does not show a 1 is 5 out of 6, since there are 5 other possible outcomes (2, 3, 4, 5, 6). since the dice are independent, the probability that neither die shows a 1 would be (5/6) times (5/6), which is (5/6)^2.

calculating that, (5/6)^2 is 25/36. so, the probability that neither die shows a 1 is 25/36. therefore, the probability that at least one die shows a 1 should be 1 minus that, right? so, 1 - 25/36 equals 11/36.

wait, but let me double-check that. maybe i should calculate it directly to confirm. so, directly finding the number of favorable outcomes where at least one die is a 1.

there are two scenarios here: either the first die is a 1 and the second isn't, or the second die is a 1 and the first isn't, or both dice are 1s.

so, for the first scenario, the first die is a 1 and the second die is not a 1. there's 1 way for the first die to be a 1 and 5 ways for the second die to be not a 1, so that's 1*5 = 5 favorable outcomes.

similarly, for the second scenario, the second die is a 1 and the first die is not a 1. again, that's 1*5 = 5 favorable outcomes.

and finally, for both dice being 1s, that's 1 way (both are 1).

so, total favorable outcomes are 5 + 5 + 1 = 11.

since the total number of possible outcomes is 36, the probability is 11/36.

okay, that matches what i got earlier using the complementary approach. so, that's reassuring.

alternatively, i could think about it using combinations or permutations, but in this case, since the dice are distinguishable (they are two separate dice), it's straightforward to consider their individual outcomes.

another way to look at it is to list out all the possible outcomes where at least one die is a 1. so, let's list them:

- (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)

that's 6 outcomes where the first die is a 1.

and then:

- (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)

that's another 5 outcomes where the second die is a 1.

wait, but (1,1) is included in both lists, so i need to make sure i don't double-count it. so, total unique favorable outcomes are 6 + 5 - 1 = 10. wait, that's only 10, but earlier i got 11.

hmm, there's a discrepancy here. let me check my counting again.

first list: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) – that's 6 outcomes.

second list: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) – that's 5 outcomes.

total unique outcomes: 6 + 5 - 1 = 10, because (1,1) is counted in both.

but earlier, i had 11 favorable outcomes. which one is correct?

wait a minute, maybe i miscounted earlier. let's recount the direct method.

first scenario: first die is 1, second die is not 1 – that's (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) – that's 5 outcomes.

second scenario: second die is 1, first die is not 1 – that's (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) – that's another 5 outcomes.

third scenario: both dice are 1 – that's (1,1) – that's 1 outcome.

total favorable outcomes: 5 + 5 + 1 = 11.

but when i list them out, it's only 10 unique outcomes because (1,1) is included in both the first and second scenarios. so, why is there a discrepancy here?

ah, i see the confusion. when i list the outcomes where the first die is 1, that includes (1,1), and when i list the outcomes where the second die is 1, that also includes (1,1). so, if i add them directly, i'm double-counting (1,1). therefore, to get the correct total, i should add the two scenarios and then subtract the overlap.

so, it's 6 (first die is 1) + 5 (second die is 1) - 1 (both are 1) = 10 favorable outcomes.

but earlier, using the complementary approach, i got 11/36, which suggests 11 favorable outcomes out of 36.

which one is correct?

wait, perhaps i miscounted the direct method. let's think carefully.

if i have two dice, and i want at least one to be a 1, the possible favorable outcomes are:

- first die is 1, second die anything: 6 outcomes.

- second die is 1, first die anything: 6 outcomes.

but this double-counts the (1,1) outcome.

so, total favorable outcomes should be 6 + 6 - 1 = 11.

yes, that makes sense. so, there are indeed 11 favorable outcomes.

but earlier, when listing the unique outcomes, i thought it was only 10, but that can't be right.

wait, perhaps i miscounted when listing them out. let's list them again:

from first die is 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) – that's 6.

from second die is 1: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) – that's 5.

total unique: 6 + 5 - 1 = 10, but according to the other method, it should be 11.

wait, there must be a mistake here.

hold on, perhaps i missed an outcome in the listing.

from first die is 1: 6 outcomes.

from second die is 1: 6 outcomes, including (1,1).

so, total unique favorable outcomes: 6 + 6 - 1 = 11.

yes, that makes sense. so, i must have miscounted earlier when listing them out.

let me try listing them again:

- (1,1)

- (1,2)

- (1,3)

- (1,4)

- (1,5)

- (1,6)

- (2,1)

- (3,1)

- (4,1)

- (5,1)

- (6,1)

that's 11 unique outcomes.

okay, now it matches the earlier calculation. so, there are indeed 11 favorable outcomes out of 36 possible.

therefore, the probability is 11/36.

alternatively, using the complementary approach: probability of neither die showing a 1 is (5/6)*(5/6) = 25/36.

so, probability of at least one die showing a 1 is 1 - 25/36 = 11/36.

both methods agree, so i'm confident that 11/36 is the correct probability.

just to be thorough, maybe i can think about it in terms of combinations or permutations.

but in this case, since the dice are distinguishable and order matters (i.e., (1,2) is different from (2,1)), it's probably not necessary to use combinations.

alternatively, if i consider the dice to be indistinguishable, the calculation might be a bit different, but in standard probability problems with dice, they are considered distinguishable unless specified otherwise.

so, sticking with distinguishable dice, the answer is 11/36.

therefore, the probability that at least one of the two fair 6-sided dice shows a 1 is 11/36.

**final answer**

the probability is \boxed{\dfrac{11}{36}}.
