Problem: A game board is constructed by shading two of the regions formed by the altitudes of an equilateral triangle as shown. What is the probability that the tip of the spinner will come to rest in a shaded region? Express your answer as a common fraction. [asy]
import olympiad; size(100); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));
pair A = (0,0), B = (1,0), C = (0.5,sqrt(3)/2);
pair D = (A + B)/2, E = (B + C)/2, F = (C + A)/2;
pair M = intersectionpoint(A--E,B--F);
draw(A--B--C--cycle);
draw(A--E^^B--F^^C--D);
filldraw(D--M--B--cycle,fillpen=gray(0.6));
filldraw(F--M--C--cycle,fillpen=gray(0.6));
draw(M--(0.4,0.5),EndArrow(size=10));
