Answer: To find the probability that a license plate with a sequence of three letters followed by three digits contains at least one palindrome, we use the complementary probability approach.

first, we calculate the total number of possible sequences:
- for letters: \(26^3 = 17,576\)
- for digits: \(10^3 = 1,000\)

next, we find the number of palindromic sequences:
- for letters: \(26 \times 1 \times 26 = 676\)
- for digits: \(10 \times 1 \times 10 = 100\)

the probabilities of having a palindrome in each part are:
- \(p(a) = \frac{676}{17,576} = \frac{676}{17,576} = \frac{676}{17,576} = \frac{25}{26}\)
- \(p(b) = \frac{100}{1,000} = \frac{1}{10}\)

the probabilities of not having a palindrome in each part are:
- \(p(a') = 1 - p(a) = 1 - \frac{676}{17,576} = \frac{16,900}{17,576} = \frac{25}{26}\)
- \(p(b') = 1 - p(b) = 1 - \frac{1}{10} = \frac{9}{10}\)

the probability that neither part is a palindrome is:
\[ p(a' \text{ and } b') = p(a') \times p(b') = \frac{25}{26} \times \frac{9}{10} = \frac{225}{260} = \frac{45}{52} \]

thus, the probability that at least one part is a palindrome is:
\[ p(a \text{ or } b) = 1 - p(a' \text{ and } b') = 1 - \frac{45}{52} = \frac{7}{52} \]

since 7 and 52 are relatively prime, the fraction is in its simplest form. therefore, \(m = 7\) and \(n = 52\), and \(m + n = 59\).

\[
\boxed{59}
\]
