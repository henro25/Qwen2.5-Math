Reasoning: 
So i have this probability problem about license plates. it says that many states use a sequence of three letters followed by three digits as their standard license-plate pattern. each of these arrangements is equally likely, and i need to find the probability that such a license plate will contain at least one palindrome. a palindrome is something that reads the same forwards and backwards, like "aba" or "121". the answer should be in the form of m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers, and then find m + n.

okay, first things first, i need to understand what constitutes a palindrome in this context. for the letters, a three-letter arrangement is a palindrome if the first and third letters are the same, regardless of what the middle letter is. similarly, for the digits, a three-digit arrangement is a palindrome if the first and third digits are the same.

so, the license plate has two parts: three letters and three digits. i need to find the probability that at least one of these parts is a palindrome.

when dealing with "at least one" in probability, it's often easier to find the probability of the complementary event (i.e., neither the letters nor the digits form a palindrome) and then subtract that from 1.

so, let's define:

- a: the event that the three-letter sequence is a palindrome.

- b: the event that the three-digit sequence is a palindrome.

we need p(a or b), which is the probability that either a or b or both occur. by the principle of inclusion-exclusion:

p(a or b) = p(a) + p(b) - p(a and b)

but as i thought earlier, it might be easier to find p(neither a nor b), which is p(a' and b'), and then subtract that from 1.

so, p(a or b) = 1 - p(a' and b')

assuming that the letters and digits are chosen independently, p(a' and b') = p(a') * p(b')

therefore, p(a or b) = 1 - p(a') * p(b')

so, i need to find p(a) and p(b), or rather p(a') and p(b'), the probabilities that the letters and digits are not palindromes.

first, let's find the total number of possible three-letter sequences.

assuming that letters can be repeated and that they are uppercase english letters, there are 26 letters in the english alphabet.

so, the total number of three-letter sequences is 26^3.

similarly, for three-digit sequences, assuming digits are from 0 to 9 and can be repeated, there are 10^3 possibilities.

now, let's find the number of palindromic three-letter sequences.

a palindrome for letters would have the first and third letters the same, and the middle letter can be anything.

so, for the first letter, there are 26 choices. the third letter must be the same as the first, so only 1 choice. the middle letter can be any of the 26 letters.

therefore, the number of palindromic three-letter sequences is 26 * 1 * 26 = 26^2 = 676.

similarly, for digits, a palindromic three-digit sequence has the first and third digits the same, and the middle digit can be anything.

so, for the first digit, there are 10 choices. the third digit must be the same as the first, so only 1 choice. the middle digit can be any of the 10 digits.

therefore, the number of palindromic three-digit sequences is 10 * 1 * 10 = 10^2 = 100.

now, p(a) is the probability that the three-letter sequence is a palindrome, which is number of palindromic sequences divided by total number of sequences.

so, p(a) = 676 / 26^3 = 676 / 17,576.

similarly, p(b) = 100 / 10^3 = 100 / 1,000 = 1/10.

but actually, i need p(a') and p(b'), which are the probabilities that the sequences are not palindromes.

so, p(a') = 1 - p(a) = 1 - (676 / 17,576) = (17,576 - 676) / 17,576 = 16,900 / 17,576.

similarly, p(b') = 1 - p(b) = 1 - (100 / 1,000) = 900 / 1,000 = 9/10.

therefore, p(a or b) = 1 - p(a') * p(b') = 1 - (16,900 / 17,576) * (9/10).

now, let's compute that.

first, simplify 16,900 / 17,576.

let's see, 17,576 divided by 16,900.

wait, actually, let's compute it step by step.

16,900 / 17,576 = ?

well, 17,576 is 26^3, which is 26 * 26 * 26.

26 * 26 is 676, and 676 * 26 is 17,576.

similarly, 16,900 is 26^2 * 25, because 26^2 is 676, and 676 * 25 is 16,900.

wait, is that right?

26^2 is 676, and 676 * 25 is indeed 16,900.

so, 16,900 / 17,576 = 676 * 25 / (676 * 26) = 25 / 26.

oh, that's a neat simplification.

similarly, 9/10 is already simplified.

therefore, p(a or b) = 1 - (25/26) * (9/10) = 1 - (225/260).

now, 225/260 can be simplified.

both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5.

225 ÷ 5 = 45

260 ÷ 5 = 52

so, 45/52.

therefore, p(a or b) = 1 - 45/52 = (52 - 45)/52 = 7/52.

so, the probability is 7/52.

but wait, i need to make sure that 7 and 52 are relatively prime.

52 factors into 2 * 2 * 13.

7 is prime, and it doesn't divide 52, so they are relatively prime.

therefore, m = 7 and n = 52, and m + n = 59.

so, the answer should be 59.

**final answer**
