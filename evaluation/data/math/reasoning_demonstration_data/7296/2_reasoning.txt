Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: there's a stick that's 5 cm long, another that's 9 cm long, and a third one that's n cm long. these three sticks are supposed to form a triangle, and i need to find the sum of all possible whole number values for n.

okay, first thing i remember is the triangle inequality theorem. it says that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. so, for three sides a, b, and c, the following must all be true:

1. a + b > c

2. a + c > b

3. b + c > a

in this problem, the sides are 5 cm, 9 cm, and n cm. so, plugging these into the inequalities:

1. 5 + 9 > n

2. 5 + n > 9

3. 9 + n > 5

simplifying these:

1. 14 > n or n < 14

2. 5 + n > 9 → n > 9 - 5 → n > 4

3. 9 + n > 5 → n > 5 - 9 → n > -4

wait a minute, the third inequality says n > -4, but since n is a length, it has to be positive, so n > 0. but n > 4 is more restrictive than n > -4, so i can ignore n > -4 because n has to be greater than 4 anyway.

so, combining the first two inequalities:

n > 4 and n < 14

but since n has to be a whole number, n can be 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or 13.

now, i need to find the sum of these possible values of n.

let me list them out:

5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

now, to find the sum, i can add them one by one:

5 + 6 = 11

11 + 7 = 18

18 + 8 = 26

26 + 9 = 35

35 + 10 = 45

45 + 11 = 56

56 + 12 = 68

68 + 13 = 81

so, the sum of all possible whole number values of n is 81.

wait, let me double-check that addition to make sure i didn't make a mistake.

starting over:

5 + 6 = 11

11 + 7 = 18

18 + 8 = 26

26 + 9 = 35

35 + 10 = 45

45 + 11 = 56

56 + 12 = 68

68 + 13 = 81

yeah, that seems correct.

alternatively, i could use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. the numbers are consecutive, so it's an arithmetic sequence with first term a = 5, last term l = 13, and number of terms n = 9.

the sum s = n/2 * (a + l) = 9/2 * (5 + 13) = 4.5 * 18 = 81

okay, that matches my previous result. so, the sum is definitely 81.

i think that's it!

**final answer**

81
