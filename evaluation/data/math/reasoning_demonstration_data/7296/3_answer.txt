Answer: To determine the possible whole number values of \( n \) that allow the sticks of lengths 5 cm, 9 cm, and \( n \) cm to form a triangle, we use the triangle inequality theorem. the inequalities are:

1. \( 5 + 9 > n \)
2. \( 5 + n > 9 \)
3. \( 9 + n > 5 \)

simplifying these inequalities:

1. \( 14 > n \) or \( n < 14 \)
2. \( 5 + n > 9 \) which simplifies to \( n > 4 \)
3. \( 9 + n > 5 \) which simplifies to \( n > -4 \) (but since \( n \) is positive, this is always true)

combining the relevant inequalities, we get:

\[ 4 < n < 14 \]

since \( n \) must be a whole number, the possible values of \( n \) are:

\[ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 \]

to find the sum of these values, we use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

\[ \text{sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l) \]

where \( n = 9 \), \( a = 5 \), and \( l = 13 \):

\[ \text{sum} = \frac{9}{2} \times (5 + 13) = 4.5 \times 18 = 81 \]

thus, the sum of all possible whole number values of \( n \) is:

\[
\boxed{81}
\]
