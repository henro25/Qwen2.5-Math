Answer: First, we consider the original setup of the tripod with three legs each of length 5 feet and the top of the tripod 4 feet from the ground. the base points a, b, and c form an equilateral triangle on the ground, with each side of the triangle being \(3\sqrt{3}\) feet.

when one leg breaks off at the lower 1 foot, the new length of that leg is 4 feet. we need to find the new height \(h\) of the top of the tripod from the ground.

we place the top of the tripod at \(t(0,0,k)\) and the base points at \(a'(x,y,0)\), \(b(-\frac{3}{2}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}, 0)\), and \(c(-\frac{3}{2}, -\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}, 0)\).

using the distance formula, we have:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + k^2} = 4 \implies x^2 + y^2 + k^2 = 16
\]
\[
\sqrt{\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 + k^2} = 5 \implies \frac{9}{4} + \frac{27}{4} + k^2 = 25 \implies 9 + k^2 = 25 \implies k^2 = 16 \implies k = 4
\]

thus, the new height \(h\) of the top of the tripod from the ground is 4 feet. this can be written as \(\frac{4}{\sqrt{1}}\), where \(m = 4\) and \(n = 1\).

finally, we find:
