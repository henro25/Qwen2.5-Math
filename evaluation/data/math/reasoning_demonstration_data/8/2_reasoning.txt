Reasoning: So i'm trying to figure out how many lattice points lie on the hyperbola defined by the equation 
x
2
−
y
2
=
200
0
2
x 
2
 −y 
2
 =2000 
2
 . a lattice point is just a point where both 
x
x and 
y
y are integers, so i need to find all integer solutions to this equation.

first, i should probably rearrange the equation to make it easier to work with. let's see, 
x
2
−
y
2
=
200
0
2
x 
2
 −y 
2
 =2000 
2
  can be factored as 
(
x
−
y
)
(
x
+
y
)
=
200
0
2
(x−y)(x+y)=2000 
2
 . that seems promising because it turns the problem into finding pairs of integers whose product is 
200
0
2
2000 
2
 , and those pairs correspond to 
(
x
−
y
)
(x−y) and 
(
x
+
y
)
(x+y).

so, if i let 
a
=
x
−
y
a=x−y and 
b
=
x
+
y
b=x+y, then i have 
a
×
b
=
200
0
2
a×b=2000 
2
 . my goal is to find all integer pairs 
(
a
,
b
)
(a,b) such that their product is 
200
0
2
2000 
2
 , and then solve for 
x
x and 
y
y in terms of 
a
a and 
b
b.

from 
a
=
x
−
y
a=x−y and 
b
=
x
+
y
b=x+y, i can solve for 
x
x and 
y
y:

x
=
a
+
b
2
,
y
=
b
−
a
2
x= 
2
a+b
​
 ,y= 
2
b−a
​
 
for 
x
x and 
y
y to be integers, both 
a
+
b
a+b and 
b
−
a
b−a must be even, which means that 
a
a and 
b
b must be both even or both odd. however, since 
200
0
2
2000 
2
  is even, and actually divisible by 4 (because 
2000
2000 is divisible by 2 multiple times), both 
a
a and 
b
b must be even. otherwise, their product wouldn't be divisible by 4.

so, i need to find all pairs of even integers 
(
a
,
b
)
(a,b) such that 
a
×
b
=
200
0
2
a×b=2000 
2
 .

first, let's factorize 
200
0
2
2000 
2
 . since 
2000
=
2
4
×
5
3
×
5
3
2000=2 
4
 ×5 
3
 ×5 
3
 , wait, no. let's do it properly.

2000
=
2
4
×
5
3
2000=2 
4
 ×5 
3
 , because 
2000
=
16
×
125
2000=16×125, and 
16
=
2
4
16=2 
4
 , 
125
=
5
3
125=5 
3
 . therefore, 
200
0
2
=
(
2
4
×
5
3
)
2
=
2
8
×
5
6
2000 
2
 =(2 
4
 ×5 
3
 ) 
2
 =2 
8
 ×5 
6
 .

so, the prime factorization of 
200
0
2
2000 
2
  is 
2
8
×
5
6
2 
8
 ×5 
6
 .

now, the number of positive divisors of 
200
0
2
2000 
2
  is 
(
8
+
1
)
(
6
+
1
)
=
9
×
7
=
63
(8+1)(6+1)=9×7=63. but since both 
a
a and 
b
b need to be even, and 
a
×
b
=
200
0
2
a×b=2000 
2
 , i need to find the number of pairs 
(
a
,
b
)
(a,b) where both 
a
a and 
b
b are even divisors of 
200
0
2
2000 
2
 .

alternatively, since 
a
a and 
b
b are both even, i can set 
a
=
2
k
a=2k and 
b
=
2
m
b=2m, where 
k
k and 
m
m are integers. then, 
(
2
k
)
(
2
m
)
=
200
0
2
(2k)(2m)=2000 
2
 , so 
4
k
m
=
200
0
2
4km=2000 
2
 , which means 
k
m
=
200
0
2
4
=
50
0
2
km= 
4
2000 
2
 
​
 =500 
2
 .

so, now i need to find all integer pairs 
(
k
,
m
)
(k,m) such that 
k
×
m
=
50
0
2
k×m=500 
2
 .

the number of such pairs is equal to the number of divisors of 
50
0
2
500 
2
 , considering both positive and negative divisors.

first, let's factorize 
500
500. 
500
=
2
2
×
5
3
500=2 
2
 ×5 
3
 , so 
50
0
2
=
(
2
2
×
5
3
)
2
=
2
4
×
5
6
500 
2
 =(2 
2
 ×5 
3
 ) 
2
 =2 
4
 ×5 
6
 .

the number of positive divisors of 
50
0
2
500 
2
  is 
(
4
+
1
)
(
6
+
1
)
=
5
×
7
=
35
(4+1)(6+1)=5×7=35. since both 
k
k and 
m
m can be positive or negative, the total number of integer pairs 
(
k
,
m
)
(k,m) is 
35
×
2
=
70
35×2=70.

wait, no. actually, for each positive divisor pair 
(
k
,
m
)
(k,m), there is a corresponding negative pair 
(
−
k
,
−
m
)
(−k,−m), but 
(
k
,
m
)
(k,m) and 
(
−
k
,
−
m
)
(−k,−m) would give the same 
a
a and 
b
b, since 
a
=
2
k
a=2k and 
b
=
2
m
b=2m, and 
x
=
a
+
b
2
x= 
2
a+b
​
 , 
y
=
b
−
a
2
y= 
2
b−a
​
 . so, i need to be careful here.

alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider all possible pairs 
(
a
,
b
)
(a,b) where 
a
×
b
=
200
0
2
a×b=2000 
2
 , and both 
a
a and 
b
b are even integers.

the total number of such pairs is equal to the number of ways to write 
200
0
2
2000 
2
  as a product of two even integers.

given that 
200
0
2
=
2
8
×
5
6
2000 
2
 =2 
8
 ×5 
6
 , and both 
a
a and 
b
b must be even, meaning they have at least one factor of 2 each.

so, i can set 
a
=
2
k
a=2k, 
b
=
2
m
b=2m, then 
k
×
m
=
2
6
×
5
6
k×m=2 
6
 ×5 
6
 .

wait, let's see: 
a
=
2
k
a=2k, 
b
=
2
m
b=2m, so 
(
2
k
)
(
2
m
)
=
4
k
m
=
200
0
2
=
2
8
×
5
6
(2k)(2m)=4km=2000 
2
 =2 
8
 ×5 
6
 , so 
k
m
=
2
6
×
5
6
km=2 
6
 ×5 
6
 .

therefore, 
k
m
=
2
6
×
5
6
km=2 
6
 ×5 
6
 .

now, the number of integer pairs 
(
k
,
m
)
(k,m) such that 
k
×
m
=
2
6
×
5
6
k×m=2 
6
 ×5 
6
  is equal to the number of divisors of 
2
6
×
5
6
2 
6
 ×5 
6
 , considering positive and negative divisors.

the number of positive divisors is 
(
6
+
1
)
(
6
+
1
)
=
49
(6+1)(6+1)=49. for each positive divisor 
k
k, there is a corresponding 
m
=
2
6
×
5
6
k
m= 
k
2 
6
 ×5 
6
 
​
 . additionally, for each negative divisor 
k
k, there is a corresponding 
m
=
2
6
×
5
6
k
m= 
k
2 
6
 ×5 
6
 
​
 , which is negative. so, total number of integer pairs 
(
k
,
m
)
(k,m) is 
49
×
2
=
98
49×2=98.

however, this counts both 
(
k
,
m
)
(k,m) and 
(
−
k
,
−
m
)
(−k,−m), which correspond to the same 
a
a and 
b
b because 
a
=
2
k
a=2k, 
b
=
2
m
b=2m, and 
x
=
a
+
b
2
x= 
2
a+b
​
 , 
y
=
b
−
a
2
y= 
2
b−a
​
 . wait, actually, no. if 
k
k and 
m
m are both negative, then 
a
=
2
k
a=2k and 
b
=
2
m
b=2m are both negative, but 
x
=
a
+
b
2
x= 
2
a+b
​
  and 
y
=
b
−
a
2
y= 
2
b−a
​
  would still give valid integer solutions, potentially different from the positive counterparts.

alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that each pair 
(
a
,
b
)
(a,b) corresponds to a unique pair 
(
x
,
y
)
(x,y), and since 
a
×
b
=
200
0
2
a×b=2000 
2
 , with both 
a
a and 
b
b even, the number of such pairs should be equal to the number of positive divisor pairs multiplied by 2 (for the sign choices), but ensuring that 
a
a and 
b
b are both even.

wait, perhaps there's a better approach. maybe i should consider the symmetry of the hyperbola.

the hyperbola 
x
2
−
y
2
=
200
0
2
x 
2
 −y 
2
 =2000 
2
  is symmetric with respect to both the 
x
x-axis and the 
y
y-axis, as well as the origin. so, if 
(
x
,
y
)
(x,y) is a solution, then 
(
−
x
,
y
)
(−x,y), 
(
x
,
−
y
)
(x,−y), and 
(
−
x
,
−
y
)
(−x,−y) are also solutions.

therefore, i can find the number of solutions in the first quadrant (where 
x
x and 
y
y are positive) and then multiply by 4 to account for all quadrants.

so, let's focus on finding positive integer solutions 
(
x
,
y
)
(x,y) with 
x
>
y
x>y, since 
x
2
−
y
2
=
200
0
2
x 
2
 −y 
2
 =2000 
2
  implies 
x
>
y
x>y.

given 
x
2
−
y
2
=
200
0
2
x 
2
 −y 
2
 =2000 
2
 , i can write this as 
(
x
−
y
)
(
x
+
y
)
=
200
0
2
(x−y)(x+y)=2000 
2
 .

let me set 
d
1
=
x
−
y
d 
1
​
 =x−y and 
d
2
=
x
+
y
d 
2
​
 =x+y, so 
d
1
×
d
2
=
200
0
2
d 
1
​
 ×d 
2
​
 =2000 
2
 .

since 
x
x and 
y
y are positive integers with 
x
>
y
x>y, both 
d
1
d

​
  and 
d

d

​
  are positive integers, and 
d

>
d

d

​
 >d

​
 .

also, since 
x
=
d

d

2
x=

d

​
 +d

​

​
  and 
d

−
d

d

 −d

​
  must be even, which means 
d
1
d

​
  and 
d

d

​
  are both even or both odd.

however, since

d

d

 ×d

​
 =2000

2
=

×
5

2000

 =2

 ×5 
6
 , which is divisible by 4, both 
d
1
d 
1
​
  and 
d
2
d 
2
​
  must be even. if one were odd and the other even, their product would be even but not necessarily divisible by 4, but in this case, it's divisible by 
2
8
2 
8
 , which is more than enough. wait, no. actually, if one is even and the other is odd, their product is even, but since 
200
0
2
2000 
2
  is divisible by 
2
8
2 
8
 , which is divisible by 4, but to have 
d

×
d
2
d

​
 ×d 
2
​
  divisible by 4, both being even ensures that, but actually, one even and one odd would still make the product even, but not necessarily divisible by 4. given that 
200
0
2
2000 
2
  is divisible by 
2
8
2 
8
 , which is divisible by 4, but to have 
d

×
d
2
d 
1
​
 ×d 
2
​
  divisible by 4, it's sufficient that at least one of them is divisible by 4, or both are even.

wait, actually, no. if both 
d
1
d 
1
​
  and 
d
2
d 
2
​
  are even, their product is divisible by 4, which is necessary since 
200
0
2
2000 
2
  is divisible by 
4
4. but they don't necessarily have to be both divisible by 4, as long as their product is divisible by 
4
4.

but in this case, 
200
0
2
=
2
8
×
5
6
2000 
2
 =2 
8
 ×5 
6
 , so for 
d

×
d
2
d 
1
​
 ×d 
2
​
  to be 
2
8
×
5
6
2 
8
 ×5 
6
 , and given that 
d
1
d 
1
​
  and 
d
2
d 
2
​
  are both even, we need to distribute the factors of 2 and 5 between 
d
1
d 
1
​
  and 
d
2
d 
2
​
 .

let me think about the exponents of 2 and 5 in 
d
1
d 
1
​
  and 
d
2
d 
2
​
 .

let’s denote:

d
1
=
2
a
×
5
b
d 
1
​
 =2 
a
 ×5 
b
 

d
2
=
2
c
×
5
d
d 
2
​
 =2 
c
 ×5 
d
 

then, 
d
1
×
d
2
=
2
a
+
c
×
5
b
+
d
=
2
8
×
5
6
d 
1
​
 ×d 
2
​
 =2 
a+c
 ×5 
b+d
 =2 
8
 ×5 
6
 .

since both 
d
1
d 
1
​
  and 
d
2
d 
2
​
  are even, 
a
≥
1
a≥1 and 
c
≥
1
c≥1.

also, since 
d
2
>
d
1
d 
2
​
 >d 
1
​
 , and both are positive, we can assume 
c
≥
a
c≥a, but actually, that might not necessarily hold because the exponents of 5 could influence which one is larger.

this seems a bit complicated. maybe there's a better way to approach this.

let me consider that 
d
1
d 
1
​
  and 
d
2
d 
2
​
  are both divisors of 
200
0
2
2000 
2
 , and 
d
1
×
d
2
=
200
0
2
d 
1
​
 ×d 
2
​
 =2000 
2
 , with 
d
2
>
d
1
d 
2
​
 >d 
1
​
  and both even.

the number of such pairs is equal to half the number of even divisor pairs of 
200
0
2
2000 
2
 , since each pair 
(
d
1
,
d
2
)
(d 
1
​
 ,d 
2
​
 ) and 
(
d
2
,
d
1
)
(d 
2
​
 ,d 
1
​
 ) would be counted separately, but since 
d
2
>
d
1
d 
2
​
 >d 
1
​
 , we only want one of them.

wait, but in this case, since 
d
1
d 
1
​
  and 
d
2
d 
2
​
  are distinct (unless 
d
1
=
d
2
d 
1
​
 =d 
2
​
 , which would imply 
x
=
y
x=y, but in that case, 
x
2
−
y
2
=
0
x 
2
 −y 
2
 =0, which is not equal to 
200
0
2
2000 
2
 ), so 
d
1
≠
d
2
d 
1
​
 

=d 
2
​
 .

therefore, the number of such pairs 
(
d
1
,
d
2
)
(d 
1
​
 ,d 
2
​
 ) is equal to half the number of pairs where both divisors are even and distinct.

first, find the total number of even divisors of 
200
0
2
2000 
2
 .

the prime factorization is 
2
8
×
5
6
2 
8
 ×5 
6
 , so the number of even divisors is 
(
8
)
×
(
6
+
1
)
)
=
8
×
7
=
56
(8)×(6+1))=8×7=56.

wait, no. the number of even divisors is equal to the total number of divisors minus the number of odd divisors.

the total number of divisors is 
(
8
+
1
)
(
6
+
1
)
=
9
×
7
=
63
(8+1)(6+1)=9×7=63.

the number of odd divisors is when the exponent of 2 is 0, so 
(
0
+
1
)
(
6
+
1
)
=
1
×
7
=
7
(0+1)(6+1)=1×7=7.

therefore, the number of even divisors is 
63
−
7
=
56
63−7=56.

now, the number of pairs 
(
d
1
,
d
2
)
(d 
1
​
 ,d 
2
​
 ) with 
d
1
×
d
2
=
200
0
2
d 
1
​
 ×d 
2
​
 =2000 
2
  and both even is equal to the number of ways to choose two even divisors such that their product is 
200
0
2
2000 
2
 .

but since 
d
2
=
200
0
2
d
1
d 
2
​
 = 
d 
1
​
 
2000 
2
 
​
 , for each even 
d
1
d 
1
​
 , there is exactly one even 
d
2
d 
2
​
 , provided that 
d
2
d 
2
​
  is also even, which it is because 
d
1
d 
1
​
  divides 
200
0
2
2000 
2
  and 
d
1
d 
1
​
  is even, so 
d
2
=
200
0
2
d
1
d 
2
​
 = 
d 
1
​
 
2000 
2
 
​
  must also be even.

therefore, the number of such pairs is equal to half the number of even divisors, because each pair 
(
d
1
,
d
2
)
(d 
1
​
 ,d 
2
​
 ) is counted twice (once as 
(
d
1
,
d
2
)
(d 
1
​
 ,d 
2
​
 ) and once as 
(
d
2
,
d
1
)
(d 
2
​
 ,d 
1
​
 )), but since 
d
2
>
d
1
d 
2
​
 >d 
1
​
 , we only want one of them.

wait, but 
d
1
d 
1
​
  and 
d
2
d 
2
​
  are distinct because 
d
1
=
d
2
d 
1
​
 =d 
2
​
  would imply 
d
1
2
=
200
0
2
d 
1
2
​
 =2000 
2
 , so 
d
1
=
2000
d 
1
​
 =2000, but then 
x
=
y
x=y, which doesn't satisfy the original equation. so, all pairs are distinct.

therefore, the number of pairs 
(
d
1
,
d
2
)
(d 
1
​
 ,d 
2
​
 ) with 
d
1
<
d
2
d 
1
​
 <d 
2
​
  and both even is 
56
2
=
28
2
56
​
 =28.

wait, no. the total number of even divisors is 56, and each pair 
(
d
1
,
d
2
)
(d 
1
​
 ,d 
2
​
 ) corresponds to a unique 
(
d
2
,
d
1
)
(d 
2
​
 ,d 
1
​
 ), but since 
d
1
<
d
2
d 
1
​
 <d 
2
​
 , we only count each pair once.

therefore, the number of such pairs is 
56
2
=
28
2
56
​
 =28.

but wait, 
56
56 is the total number of even divisors, and since 
d
1
d 
1
​
  can be any even divisor, and 
d
2
=
200
0
2
d
1
d 
2
​
 = 
d 
1
​
 
2000 
2
 
​
 , which is also even, and since 
d
1
≠
d
2
d 
1
​
 

=d 
2
​
 , the number of unordered pairs is 
56
2
=
28
2
56
​
 =28.

however, we need to consider the ordering 
d
1
<
d
2
d 
1
​
 <d 
2
​
 , so indeed, there are 28 such pairs.

each such pair corresponds to a unique solution 
(
x
,
y
)
(x,y) in the first quadrant, where 
x
>
y
>
0
x>y>0.

therefore, in the first quadrant, there are 28 lattice points on the hyperbola.

now, considering the symmetry of the hyperbola, for each solution 
(
x
,
y
)
(x,y), there are corresponding solutions 
(
−
x
,
y
)
(−x,y), 
(
x
,
−
y
)
(x,−y), and 
(
−
x
,
−
y
)
(−x,−y).

therefore, the total number of lattice points is 
4
×
28
=
112
4×28=112.

wait a minute, but i need to make sure that there are no solutions where 
x
x or 
y
y is zero, because if 
x
=
0
x=0, then 
−
y
2
=
200
0
2
−y 
2
 =2000 
2
 , which implies 
y
2
=
−
200
0
2
y 
2
 =−2000 
2
 , which is impossible for real numbers, let alone integers. similarly, if 
y
=
0
y=0, then 
x
2
=
200
0
2
x 
2
 =2000 
2
 , which has solutions 
x
=
±
2000
x=±2000. so, there are two additional points: 
(
2000
,
0
)
(2000,0) and 
(
−
2000
,
0
)
(−2000,0).

but wait, in the earlier count of 28 solutions in the first quadrant, do these points get included? if 
y
=
0
y=0, then 
d
1
=
x
−
0
=
x
d 
1
​
 =x−0=x, 
d
2
=
x
+
0
=
x
d 
2
​
 =x+0=x, so 
d
1
=
d
2
=
x
d 
1
​
 =d 
2
​
 =x, but then 
d
1
×
d
2
=
x
2
=
200
0
2
d 
1
​
 ×d 
2
​
 =x 
2
 =2000 
2
 , so 
x
=
±
2000
x=±2000. however, in our earlier approach, we assumed 
d
1
<
d
2
d 
1
​
 <d 
2
​
 , but in this case, 
d
1
=
d
2
=
2000
d 
1
​
 =d 
2
​
 =2000, which was excluded because 
d
1
≠
d
2
d 
1
​
 

=d 
2
​
 . therefore, the points 
(
2000
,
0
)
(2000,0) and 
(
−
2000
,
0
)
(−2000,0) are not included in the 28 solutions we counted earlier.

therefore, in addition to the 112 points from the 28 solutions in the first quadrant and their symmetries, there are these two extra points.

wait, but actually, if 
d
1
=
d
2
=
2000
d 
1
​
 =d 
2
​
 =2000, then 
x
=
2000
+
2000
2
=
2000
x= 
2
2000+2000
​
 =2000, 
y
=
2000
−
2000
2
=
0
y= 
2
2000−2000
​
 =0, which gives 
(
2000
,
0
)
(2000,0). similarly, 
(
−
2000
,
0
)
(−2000,0) can be obtained by considering negative values. however, since we excluded the case 
d
1
=
d
2
d 
1
​
 =d 
2
​
 , these points are not included in the 28 solutions.

therefore, the total number of lattice points is 
112
+
2
=
114
112+2=114.

but let's double-check this reasoning.

first, find all positive integer solutions 
(
x
,
y
)
(x,y) with 
x
>
y
x>y, then multiply by 4 for symmetry, and then add the points where 
y
=
0
y=0.

alternatively, perhaps i should consider that the cases where 
y
=
0
y=0 are separate and should be added after considering the general solutions.

alternatively, perhaps i should consider that when 
y
=
0
y=0, the equation becomes 
x
2
=
200
0
2
x 
2
 =2000 
2
 , so 
x
=
±
2000
x=±2000, giving two points: 
(
2000
,
0
)
(2000,0) and 
(
−
2000
,
0
)
(−2000,0).

similarly, if 
x
=
0
x=0, 
−
y
2
=
200
0
2
−y 
2
 =2000 
2
 , which has no real solutions, so no points there.

therefore, in addition to the 112 points from the 28 solutions in the first quadrant and their symmetries, there are two more points: 
(
2000
,
0
)
(2000,0) and 
(
−
2000
,
0
)
(−2000,0), making the total 
114
114.

but let's confirm if there are any other special cases or if i've miscounted something.

alternatively, perhaps i should consider that for each pair 
(
d
1
,
d
2
)
(d 
1
​
 ,d 
2
​
 ), where 
d
1
×
d
2
=
200
0
2
d 
1
​
 ×d 
2
​
 =2000 
2
  and both are even, with 
d
1
<
d
2
d 
1
​
 <d 
2
​
 , there is one solution in the first quadrant, and then four solutions considering all quadrants (unless there's some overlap).

wait, actually, for each such pair, there are four solutions: 
(
x
,
y
)
(x,y), 
(
−
x
,
y
)
(−x,y), 
(
x
,
−
y
)
(x,−y), and 
(
−
x
,
−
y
)
(−x,−y), provided that 
x
x and 
y
y are both non-zero.

if 
y
=
0
y=0, then 
x
=
±
2000
x=±2000, which are already accounted for separately.

therefore, the total number of lattice points is 
4
×
28
=
112
4×28=112, plus the two points where 
y
=
0
y=0, totaling 
114
114.

alternatively, maybe i should consider that when 
y
=
0
y=0, the pair 
(
d
1
,
d
2
)
=
(
2000
,
2000
)
(d 
1
​
 ,d 
2
​
 )=(2000,2000), but since 
d
1
=
d
2
d 
1
​
 =d 
2
​
 , and we've excluded that case in our earlier counting, these two points are indeed additional.

therefore, the total number of lattice points on the hyperbola is 
114
114.

however, i recall that sometimes in such problems, the number of solutions can be even, and maybe i've miscounted by including the points where 
y
=
0
y=0.

alternatively, perhaps i should consider that the two points where 
y
=
0
y=0 are included in the count of 112 points, but that seems unlikely since we excluded the case 
d
1
=
d
2
d 
1
​
 =d 
2
​
 .

alternatively, perhaps i should think differently.

let me try to find the number of positive integer solutions 
(
x
,
y
)
(x,y) with 
x
>
y
x>y, then multiply by 4 to account for all quadrants, and then add the points where 
y
=
0
y=0.

given 
x
2
−
y
2
=
200
0
2
x 
2
 −y 
2
 =2000 
2
 , and 
x
>
y
>
0
x>y>0, then 
x
=
d
1
+
d
2
2
x=

d

​
 +d

​
 
​
 , 
y
=
d

−
d

2
y=

d

​
 −d

​
 
​
 , where 
d
1
=
x
−
y
d 
1
​
 =x−y, 
d
2
=
x
+
y
d 
2
​
 =x+y, and 
d
1
×
d

=
200

d

​
 ×d

​
 =2000 
2
 , with 
d
1
<
d
2
d 
1
​
 <d 
2
​
 , both even.

the number of such pairs 
(
d
1
,
d
2
)
(d 
1
​
 ,d 
2
​
 ) is equal to the number of ways to choose 
d

d 
1
​
  and 
d
2
d 
2
​
  such that 
d

<
d

 <d

×
d

=
200

d 
1
​
 ×d 
2
​
 =2000 
2
 .

as previously calculated, there are 28 such pairs.

therefore, there are 28 solutions in the first quadrant, leading to 
4
×
28
=
112
4×28=112 points in all quadrants.

additionally, there are two points where 
y
=
0
y=0: 
(
2000
,
0
)
(2000,0) and 
(
−
2000
,
0
)
(−2000,0).

therefore, the total number of lattice points is 
112
+
2
=
114
112+2=114.

but let's check if there are any other points where 
y
=
0
y=0, but as discussed earlier, only 
x
=
±
2000
x=±2000 satisfy the equation in that case.

therefore, the final answer should be 
114
114.

wait, but i'm not entirely confident. maybe i should look up a similar problem or see if there's a formula for the number of lattice points on a hyperbola.

alternatively, perhaps there's a formula involving the number of ways to express 
n
n as a difference of squares.

wait, actually, 
x
2
−
y
2
=
n
x 
2
 −y 
2
 =n can be expressed as 
(
x
−
y
)
(
x
+
y
)
=
n
(x−y)(x+y)=n, and the number of solutions depends on the factor pairs of 
n
n.

in this case, 
n
=
200
0
2
n=2000 
2
 , and both 
x
x and 
y
y are integers.

given that 
x
x and 
y
y are integers, 
x
−
y
x−y and 
x
+
y
x+y must both be integers of the same parity (both even or both odd), as previously established.

since 
n
=
200
0
2
n=2000 
2
  is even, and specifically divisible by 4, both 
x
−
y
x−y and 
x
+
y
x+y must be even.

therefore, the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to write 
200
0
2
2000 
2
  as a product of two even integers 
a
a and 
b
b, where 
a
<
b
a<b, and then multiplying by 4 for symmetry, plus the two points where 
y
=
0
y=0.

alternatively, perhaps the total number of lattice points is equal to the number of positive divisor pairs 
(
d
1
,
d
2
)
(d 
1
​
 ,d 
2
​
 ) with 
d
1
×
d
2
=
200
0
2
d 
1
​
 ×d 
2
​
 =2000 
2
 , both even, and then accounting for symmetry.

given that i've already calculated 28 such pairs in the first quadrant, leading to 112 points, plus the two points where 
y
=
0
y=0, totaling 114 points.

therefore, the final answer should be 
114
114
​
 .
