Answer: To solve the expression \(3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 + 15 \div 3\), we follow the order of operations (pemdas):

1. there are no parentheses or exponents, so we proceed with multiplication and division from left to right.
2. calculate \(3 \cdot 5\):
   \[
   3 \cdot 5 = 15
   \]
3. next, multiply the result by 7:
   \[
   15 \cdot 7 = 105
   \]
4. then, perform the division \(15 \div 3\):
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
5. finally, add the results of the multiplication and division:
   \[
   105 + 5 = 110
   \]

thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{110}\).
