Reasoning: So i've got this math problem here: 
3
⋅
5
⋅
7
+
15
÷
3
3⋅5⋅7+15÷3. okay, let's see how to approach this. i remember from school that there's an order of operations i need to follow, often abbreviated as pemdas: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division from left to right, and addition and subtraction from left to right.

first, there are no parentheses or exponents in this expression, so i can skip those steps. next up is multiplication and division. i need to perform these operations from left to right. let's look at the expression again: 
3
⋅
5
⋅
7
+
15
÷
3
3⋅5⋅7+15÷3.

starting from the left, i see 
3
⋅
5
⋅
7
3⋅5⋅7. hmm, should i do 
3
⋅
5
3⋅5 first or 
5
⋅
7
5⋅7 first? according to the order of operations, i should go from left to right, so i'll do 
3
⋅
5
3⋅5 first. that's 
15
15. now the expression looks like 
15
⋅
7
+
15
÷
3
15⋅7+15÷3.

next, i need to do the multiplication and division before addition. so, 
15
⋅
7
15⋅7 is next. let's calculate that. 
15
×
7
15×7 is 
105
105. so now the expression is 
105
+
15
÷
3
105+15÷3.

now, i need to do the division before the addition. so, 
15
÷
3
15÷3 is 
5
5. the expression now is 
105
+
5
105+5.

finally, i just need to add those two numbers together. 
105
+
5
105+5 equals 
110
110.

wait a minute, is there a quicker way to do this? maybe i could have combined some steps. let me think. if i look at the original expression, 
3
⋅
5
⋅
7
+
15
÷
3
3⋅5⋅7+15÷3, i can see that 
15
÷
3
15÷3 is 
5
5, as i calculated before. so, the expression simplifies to 
3
⋅
5
⋅
7
+
5
3⋅5⋅7+5.

now, maybe i can factor out a 5 from both terms. let's see: 
3
⋅
5
⋅
7
+
5
=
5
(
3
⋅
7
+
1
)
3⋅5⋅7+5=5(3⋅7+1). calculating inside the parentheses first: 
3
⋅
7
3⋅7 is 
21
21, plus 
1
1 is 
22
22. so, 
5
×
22
5×22 is 
110
110. okay, that matches my previous answer.

another way to approach this could be to compute 
3
⋅
5
⋅
7
3⋅5⋅7 directly. let's see: 
3
×
5
=
15
3×5=15, and 
15
×
7
=
105
15×7=105. then, 
105
+
15
÷
3
=
105
+
5
=
110
105+15÷3=105+5=110. again, i get the same result.

i think i've confirmed that the answer is indeed 
110
110. to make sure i didn't make any calculation errors, let me double-check each step:

1. 
3
⋅
5
=
15
3⋅5=15

2. 
15
⋅
7
=
105
15⋅7=105

3. 
15
÷
3
=
5
15÷3=5

4. 
105
+
5
=
110
105+5=110

all these steps seem correct. i don't see any mistakes in my calculations or in the application of the order of operations. therefore, i'm confident that the final answer is 
110
110.

**final answer**

110
110
