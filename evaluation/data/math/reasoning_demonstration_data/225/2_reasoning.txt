Reasoning: So i've got this problem here. i need to find a vector that points from the origin to a given line, and this vector has to be parallel to another vector, specifically 
(
2
1
)
( 
2
1
​
 ). let me try to understand what this means.

first, the line is parameterized by:

x
=
4
t
+
2
,
y
=
t
+
2
x=4t+2,y=t+2
this means that as the parameter 
t
t changes, the points 
(
x
,
y
)
(x,y) trace out the line. so, for each value of 
t
t, i get a different point on the line.

now, i need a vector from the origin 
(
0
,
0
)
(0,0) to this line. that means i need to find some point 
(
x
,
y
)
(x,y) on the line, and then the vector from the origin to that point is just 
(
x
y
)
( 
x
y
​
 ).

but there's a catch: this vector has to be parallel to 
(
2
1
)
( 
2
1
​
 ). when vectors are parallel, one is a scalar multiple of the other. so, if my vector from the origin to the line is 
(
x
y
)
( 
x
y
​
 ), it should be equal to some scalar 
k
k times 
(
2
1
)
( 
2
1
​
 ), right? that is:

(
x
y
)
=
k
(
2
1
)
=
(
2
k
k
)
( 
x
y
​
 )=k( 
2
1
​
 )=( 
2k
k
​
 )
so, 
x
=
2
k
x=2k and 
y
=
k
y=k.

but wait, i also know that this point 
(
x
,
y
)
(x,y) lies on the line, so it must satisfy the parametric equations of the line:

x
=
4
t
+
2
,
y
=
t
+
2
x=4t+2,y=t+2
so, substituting 
x
=
2
k
x=2k and 
y
=
k
y=k into these equations:

2
k
=
4
t
+
2
and
k
=
t
+
2
2k=4t+2andk=t+2
now, i have a system of two equations with two variables, 
k
k and 
t
t. i can solve this system to find the values of 
k
k and 
t
t.

let's solve the second equation for 
t
t:

k
=
t
+
2
  
⟹
  
t
=
k
−
2
k=t+2⟹t=k−2
now, plug this into the first equation:

2
k
=
4
(
k
−
2
)
+
2
2k=4(k−2)+2
let's simplify:

2
k
=
4
k
−
8
+
2
  
⟹
  
2
k
=
4
k
−
6
2k=4k−8+2⟹2k=4k−6
subtract 
4
k
4k from both sides:

−
2
k
=
−
6
  
⟹
  
k
=
3
−2k=−6⟹k=3
now, plug 
k
=
3
k=3 back into 
t
=
k
−
2
t=k−2:

t
=
3
−
2
=
1
t=3−2=1
so, 
t
=
1
t=1 and 
k
=
3
k=3.

now, the vector from the origin to the point on the line is:

(
x
y
)
=
(
2
k
k
)
=
(
6
3
)
( 
x
y
​
 )=( 
2k
k
​
 )=( 
6
3
​
 )
wait a minute, but i need to make sure that this point actually lies on the line. let's check by plugging 
t
=
1
t=1 back into the parametric equations:

x
=
4
(
1
)
+
2
=
6
,
y
=
1
+
2
=
3
x=4(1)+2=6,y=1+2=3
yes, it does give 
(
6
,
3
)
(6,3), which matches what i got for the vector.

but the problem is asking for a vector pointing from the origin to this line that is parallel to 
(
2
1
)
( 
2
1
​
 ). i think i've found that vector: 
(
6
3
)
( 
6
3
​
 ), which is indeed parallel to 
(
2
1
)
( 
2
1
​
 ) because 
(
6
3
)
=
3
(
2
1
)
( 
6
3
​
 )=3( 
2
1
​
 ).

however, the problem asks for a vector 
(
a
b
)
( 
a
b
​
 ). so, i need to express my answer in terms of 
a
a and 
b
b.

from what i have:

a
=
6
,
b
=
3
a=6,b=3
so, the vector is:

(
6
3
)
( 
6
3
​
 )
but is this the only possible answer? let me think.

if i consider that any scalar multiple of 
(
2
1
)
( 
2
1
​
 ) would work, but it has to point from the origin to the line. so, perhaps there is only one such vector that satisfies both conditions: being parallel to 
(
2
1
)
( 
2
1
​
 ) and pointing from the origin to the line.

wait, maybe i should consider that the vector must not only be parallel to 
(
2
1
)
( 
2
1
​
 ) but also that it connects the origin to the line in the direction of that vector.

alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem, perhaps using projections or something similar.

let me try another approach. the vector from the origin to the line can be found by projecting the vector from the origin to any point on the line onto the direction vector of the line.

but in this case, i need the vector to be parallel to 
(
2
1
)
( 
2
1
​
 ), not necessarily in the direction of the line's direction vector.

wait, perhaps i should find the point on the line closest to the origin, and then see if the vector from the origin to that point is parallel to 
(
2
1
)
( 
2
1
​
 ).

let me find the point on the line closest to the origin.

the line is parameterized as:

r
(
t
)
=
(
4
t
+
2
t
+
2
)
r(t)=( 
4t+2
t+2
​
 )
the vector from the origin to a point on the line is:

v
(
t
)
=
(
4
t
+
2
t
+
2
)
v(t)=( 
4t+2
t+2
​
 )
to find the point closest to the origin, i can minimize the distance squared, which is:

d
2
(
t
)
=
(
4
t
+
2
)
2
+
(
t
+
2
)
2
d 
2
 (t)=(4t+2) 
2
 +(t+2) 
2
 
let's expand this:

d
2
(
t
)
=
16
t
2
+
16
t
+
4
+
t
2
+
4
t
+
4
=
17
t
2
+
20
t
+
8
d 
2
 (t)=16t 
2
 +16t+4+t 
2
 +4t+4=17t 
2
 +20t+8
to minimize this, take derivative with respect to 
t
t and set to zero:

d
d
t
d
2
(
t
)
=
34
t
+
20
=
0
  
⟹
  
t
=
−
20
34
=
−
10
17
dt
d
​
 d 
2
 (t)=34t+20=0⟹t=− 
34
20
​
 =− 
17
10
​
 
now, plug 
t
=
−
10
17
t=− 
17
10
​
  back into the parametric equations to find the closest point:

x
=
4
(
−
10
17
)
+
2
=
−
40
17
+
34
17
=
−
6
17
x=4(− 
17
10
​
 )+2=− 
17
40
​
 + 
17
34
​
 =− 
17
6
​
 
y
=
−
10
17
+
2
=
−
10
17
+
34
17
=
24
17
y=− 
17
10
​
 +2=− 
17
10
​
 + 
17
34
​
 = 
17
24
​
 
so, the closest point is 
(
−
6
17
,
24
17
)
(− 
17
6
​
 , 
17
24
​
 ), and the vector from the origin to this point is:

(
−
6
17
24
17
)
( 
− 
17
6
​
 
17
24
​
 
​
 )
now, is this vector parallel to 
(
2
1
)
( 
2
1
​
 )? let's check if one is a scalar multiple of the other.

suppose:

(
−
6
17
24
17
)
=
k
(
2
1
)
=
(
2
k
k
)
( 
− 
17
6
​
 
17
24
​
 
​
 )=k( 
2
1
​
 )=( 
2k
k
​
 )
this would require:

−
6
17
=
2
k
and
24
17
=
k
− 
17
6
​
 =2kand 
17
24
​
 =k
from the second equation, 
k
=
24
17
k= 
17
24
​
 , but plugging into the first:

−
6
17
=
2
(
24
17
)
=
48
17
− 
17
6
​
 =2( 
17
24
​
 )= 
17
48
​
 
which is not true, so the closest point does not lie along the direction of 
(
2
1
)
( 
2
1
​
 ). that means there must be another point on the line where the vector from the origin is parallel to 
(
2
1
)
( 
2
1
​
 ).

so, perhaps my initial approach was correct, and the vector is 
(
6
3
)
( 
6
3
​
 ), but i need to make sure that this is indeed the vector pointing from the origin to the line and parallel to 
(
2
1
)
( 
2
1
​
 ).

wait, maybe i should think about the direction of the vector. if the vector from the origin to the line is parallel to 
(
2
1
)
( 
2
1
​
 ), then it should be in the direction of that vector or its opposite.

so, perhaps i should consider both positive and negative scalar multiples.

but in my earlier solution, i found 
k
=
3
k=3, giving 
(
6
3
)
( 
6
3
​
 ), which seems valid. maybe there is only one such vector.

alternatively, perhaps i can solve this using the concept of projection.

let me consider that the vector from the origin to the line, parallel to 
(
2
1
)
( 
2
1
​
 ), must satisfy being perpendicular to the direction vector of the line.

wait, the direction vector of the line is 
(
4
1
)
( 
4
1
​
 ), since the parametric equations are 
x
=
4
t
+
2
x=4t+2 and 
y
=
t
+
2
y=t+2.

if i have a vector 
(
a
b
)
( 
a
b
​
 ) from the origin to the line, and it is parallel to 
(
2
1
)
( 
2
1
​
 ), then 
(
a
b
)
=
k
(
2
1
)
( 
a
b
​
 )=k( 
2
1
​
 ).

now, for this vector to point from the origin to the line, it must be perpendicular to the direction vector of the line.

wait, is that correct? actually, no. the vector from the origin to the line, when projected onto the direction vector of the line, should give the component along the line, but i'm not sure that's the right way to think about it.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line in vector form.

the distance 
d
d from the origin to the line can be found using the formula:

d
=
∥
p
0
×
v
∥
∥
v
∥
d= 
∥v∥
∥p 
0
​
 ×v∥
​
 
where 
p
0
p 
0
​
  is a point on the line, and 
v
v is the direction vector of the line.

wait, but i need the vector from the origin to the line that is parallel to a given vector, not necessarily the perpendicular distance.

maybe i should approach this differently. let's consider the line as a set of points 
r
(
t
)
=
(
4
t
+
2
t
+
2
)
r(t)=( 
4t+2
t+2
​
 ), and i want a vector 
v
=
(
2
k
k
)
v=( 
2k
k
​
 ) such that 
v
v points to a point on the line, i.e., there exists some 
t
t where:

v
=
r
(
t
)
v=r(t)
so,

(
2
k
k
)
=
(
4
t
+
2
t
+
2
)
( 
2k
k
​
 )=( 
4t+2
t+2
​
 )
which gives the system:

2
k
=
4
t
+
2
and
k
=
t
+
2
2k=4t+2andk=t+2
solving this, as i did earlier, gives 
k
=
3
k=3 and 
t
=
1
t=1, leading to 
v
=
(
6
3
)
v=( 
6
3
​
 ).

i think this is the correct approach, and the answer should be 
(
6
3
)
( 
6
3
​
 ).

but just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other possible solutions. suppose there is another 
t
t that satisfies the equations, but from the system i solved earlier, there is only one solution for 
t
t and 
k
k, so this should be the unique vector.

therefore, the vector from the origin to the line that is parallel to 
(
2
1
)
( 
2
1
​
 ) is 
(
6
3
)
( 
6
3
​
 ).

**final answer**

(
6
3
)
( 
6
3
​
 )
​
