Reasoning: So i have this problem here: i need to find the minimum value of 
1
x
+
1
y
x
1
​	
 + 
y
1
​	
  given that 
x
+
y
=
10
x+y=10, where 
x
x and 
y
y are positive real numbers. okay, let's see how to approach this.

first, since 
x
+
y
=
10
x+y=10, maybe i can express one variable in terms of the other to reduce the number of variables. let's solve for 
y
y in terms of 
x
x. so, 
y
=
10
−
x
y=10−x. that makes sense because if i know 
x
x, i can find 
y
y, and vice versa.

now, substitute 
y
y into the expression i need to minimize: 
1
x
+
1
y
=
1
x
+
1
10
−
x
x
1
​	
 + 
y
1
​	
 = 
x
1
​	
 + 
10−x
1
​	
 . so, i have a function of one variable now: 
f
(
x
)
=
1
x
+
1
10
−
x
f(x)= 
x
1
​	
 + 
10−x
1
​	
 , where 
x
x is between 0 and 10 (since both 
x
x and 
y
y are positive).

i need to find the minimum of this function. since it's a function of one variable, i can use calculus to find its minimum. i'll need to find the derivative of 
f
(
x
)
f(x) with respect to 
x
x, set it equal to zero, and solve for 
x
x.

let's find 
f
′
(
x
)
f 
′
 (x). the derivative of 
1
x
x
1
​	
  is 
−
1
x
2
− 
x 
2
 
1
​	
 , and the derivative of 
1
10
−
x
10−x
1
​	
  is 
1
(
10
−
x
)
2
(10−x) 
2
 
1
​	
  because the derivative of 
1
u
u
1
​	
  is 
−
u
′
u
2
− 
u 
2
 
u 
′
 
​	
 , and here 
u
=
10
−
x
u=10−x, so 
u
′
=
−
1
u 
′
 =−1, hence 
1
(
10
−
x
)
2
(10−x) 
2
 
1
​	
 .

so, 
f
′
(
x
)
=
−
1
x
2
+
1
(
10
−
x
)
2
f 
′
 (x)=− 
x 
2
 
1
​	
 + 
(10−x) 
2
 
1
​	
 .

set 
f
′
(
x
)
=
0
f 
′
 (x)=0:

−
1
x
2
+
1
(
10
−
x
)
2
=
0
− 
x 
2
 
1
​	
 + 
(10−x) 
2
 
1
​	
 =0.

let's solve for 
x
x:

1
(
10
−
x
)
2
=
1
x
2
(10−x) 
2
 
1
​	
 = 
x 
2
 
1
​	
 .

taking reciprocals on both sides (since both sides are positive because 
x
x and 
y
y are positive):

(
10
−
x
)
2
=
x
2
(10−x) 
2
 =x 
2
 .

now, expand both sides:

100
−
20
x
+
x
2
=
x
2
100−20x+x 
2
 =x 
2
 .

subtract 
x
2
x 
2
  from both sides:

100
−
20
x
=
0
100−20x=0.

so, 
20
x
=
100
20x=100, which gives 
x
=
5
x=5.

okay, so 
x
=
5
x=5. then, 
y
=
10
−
x
=
5
y=10−x=5. so both 
x
x and 
y
y are 5.

now, plug these back into the original expression to find the minimum value:

1
5
+
1
5
=
2
5
5
1
​	
 + 
5
1
​	
 = 
5
2
​	
 .

so, the minimum value of 
1
x
+
1
y
x
1
​	
 + 
y
1
​	
  is 
2
5
5
2
​	
 .

wait a minute, does this make sense? let me check if this is indeed a minimum. maybe i should verify by looking at the second derivative to confirm it's a minimum.

first, find the second derivative 
f
′
′
(
x
)
f 
′′
 (x).

we have 
f
′
(
x
)
=
−
1
x
2
+
1
(
10
−
x
)
2
f 
′
 (x)=− 
x 
2
 
1
​	
 + 
(10−x) 
2
 
1
​	
 .

so, 
f
′
′
(
x
)
=
2
x
3
+
2
(
10
−
x
)
3
f 
′′
 (x)= 
x 
3
 
2
​	
 + 
(10−x) 
3
 
2
​	
 .

at 
x
=
5
x=5, 
f
′
′
(
5
)
=
2
125
+
2
125
=
4
125
f 
′′
 (5)= 
125
2
​	
 + 
125
2
​	
 = 
125
4
​	
 , which is positive. since the second derivative is positive at 
x
=
5
x=5, this critical point is indeed a local minimum.

therefore, the minimum value is 
2
5
5
2
​	
 .

alternatively, maybe i can approach this problem using the am-hm inequality, which relates the arithmetic mean and the harmonic mean.

recall that for positive real numbers, the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the harmonic mean.

so, for 
x
x and 
y
y, 
x
+
y
2
≥
2
1
x
+
1
y
2
x+y
​	
 ≥ 
x
1
​	
 + 
y
1
​	
 
2
​	
 .

given that 
x
+
y
=
10
x+y=10, plug that in:

10
2
≥
2
1
x
+
1
y
2
10
​	
 ≥ 
x
1
​	
 + 
y
1
​	
 
2
​	
 , which simplifies to 
5
≥
2
1
x
+
1
y
5≥ 
x
1
​	
 + 
y
1
​	
 
2
​	
 .

taking reciprocals (and remembering to flip the inequality since we're dealing with positive quantities):

1
5
≤
1
x
+
1
y
2
5
1
​	
 ≤ 
2
x
1
​	
 + 
y
1
​	
 
​	
 .

multiply both sides by 2:

2
5
≤
1
x
+
1
y
5
2
​	
 ≤ 
x
1
​	
 + 
y
1
​	
 .

so, the harmonic mean approach also gives that 
1
x
+
1
y
x
1
​	
 + 
y
1
​	
  is at least 
2
5
5
2
​	
 , and equality holds when 
x
=
y
x=y, which is 
x
=
y
=
5
x=y=5, confirming our earlier result.

another way to look at it is to use the method of lagrange multipliers, which is a strategy for finding the local maxima and minima of a function subject to equality constraints.

define the function to minimize as 
f
(
x
,
y
)
=
1
x
+
1
y
f(x,y)= 
x
1
​	
 + 
y
1
​	
 , subject to the constraint 
g
(
x
,
y
)
=
x
+
y
−
10
=
0
g(x,y)=x+y−10=0.

the method of lagrange multipliers tells us to set 
∇
f
=
λ
∇
g
∇f=λ∇g, where 
λ
λ is the lagrange multiplier.

compute the gradients:

∇
f
=
(
−
1
x
2
,
−
1
y
2
)
∇f=(− 
x 
2
 
1
​	
 ,− 
y 
2
 
1
​	
 )

∇
g
=
(
1
,
1
)
∇g=(1,1)

so, we have:

−
1
x
2
=
λ
− 
x 
2
 
1
​	
 =λ

−
1
y
2
=
λ
− 
y 
2
 
1
​	
 =λ

therefore, 
−
1
x
2
=
−
1
y
2
− 
x 
2
 
1
​	
 =− 
y 
2
 
1
​	
 , which implies 
1
x
2
=
1
y
2
x 
2
 
1
​	
 = 
y 
2
 
1
​	
 , and hence 
x
=
y
x=y (since 
x
x and 
y
y are positive).

again, we find that 
x
=
y
=
5
x=y=5, leading to 
1
x
+
1
y
=
2
5
x
1
​	
 + 
y
1
​	
 = 
5
2
​	
 .

alternatively, maybe i can consider the function 
f
(
x
)
=
1
x
+
1
10
−
x
f(x)= 
x
1
​	
 + 
10−x
1
​	
  and analyze its behavior.

first, note that as 
x
x approaches 0 from the positive side, 
1
x
x
1
​	
  goes to infinity, and 
1
10
−
x
10−x
1
​	
  approaches 
1
10
10
1
​	
 . so, 
f
(
x
)
f(x) approaches infinity.

similarly, as 
x
x approaches 10 from the left, 
1
x
x
1
​	
  approaches 
1
10
10
1
​	
 , and 
1
10
−
x
10−x
1
​	
  approaches infinity. so, 
f
(
x
)
f(x) approaches infinity in both extremes.

therefore, the function has a minimum somewhere between 0 and 10.

we already found that the critical point is at 
x
=
5
x=5, and the second derivative is positive there, confirming it's a minimum.

alternatively, maybe i can use the cauchy-schwarz inequality.

recall that for vectors 
a
a and 
b
b, 
(
∑
a
i
b
i
)
2
≤
(
∑
a
i
2
)
(
∑
b
i
2
)
(∑a 
i
​	
 b 
i
​	
 ) 
2
 ≤(∑a 
i
2
​	
 )(∑b 
i
2
​	
 ).

let me try to apply it to this problem.

let’s set 
a
=
(
1
,
1
)
a=(1,1) and 
b
=
(
1
x
,
1
y
)
b=( 
x
1
​	
 , 
y
1
​	
 ).

then, 
(
1
x
+
1
y
)
2
≤
(
1
2
+
1
2
)
(
(
1
x
)
2
+
(
1
y
)
2
)
( 
x
1
​	
 + 
y
1
​	
 ) 
2
 ≤(1 
2
 +1 
2
 )(( 
x
1
​	
 ) 
2
 +( 
y
1
​	
 ) 
2
 ).

hmm, not sure if that helps directly.

maybe i need to think differently.

alternatively, perhaps using the am-gm inequality.

wait, am-gm says that for positive real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean.

so, 
x
+
y
2
≥
x
y
2
x+y
​	
 ≥ 
xy
​	
 .

given that 
x
+
y
=
10
x+y=10, this becomes 
5
≥
x
y
5≥ 
xy
​	
 , so 
x
y
≤
25
xy≤25.

but i need to relate this to 
1
x
+
1
y
x
1
​	
 + 
y
1
​	
 .

let me see.

express 
1
x
+
1
y
=
x
+
y
x
y
=
10
x
y
x
1
​	
 + 
y
1
​	
 = 
xy
x+y
​	
 = 
xy
10
​	
 .

since 
x
y
≤
25
xy≤25, 
10
x
y
≥
10
25
=
2
5
xy
10
​	
 ≥ 
25
10
​	
 = 
5
2
​	
 .

therefore, 
1
x
+
1
y
≥
2
5
x
1
​	
 + 
y
1
​	
 ≥ 
5
2
​	
 , with equality when 
x
y
=
25
xy=25.

given that 
x
+
y
=
10
x+y=10, and 
x
y
=
25
xy=25, the numbers 
x
x and 
y
y are both 5, since they satisfy 
x
=
y
=
5
x=y=5.

this again confirms that the minimum value is 
2
5
5
2
​	
 .

i think i've approached this problem from multiple angles—calculus, am-hm inequality, am-gm inequality—and all methods point to the same conclusion: the minimum value of 
1
x
+
1
y
x
1
​	
 + 
y
1
​	
  is 
2
5
5
2
​	
 , achieved when 
x
=
y
=
5
x=y=5.

therefore, i'm confident that the answer is 
2
5
5
2
​	
 .

**final answer**
