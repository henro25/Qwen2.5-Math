Answer: Given the ratio of the areas of two squares is \(\frac{32}{63}\), we need to find the ratio of their side lengths, rationalize the denominator, and express it in the form \(\frac{a\sqrt{b}}{c}\) where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are integers, and then find the sum \(a + b + c\).

first, we start with the ratio of the areas:

\[
\frac{s^2}{t^2} = \frac{32}{63}
\]

taking the square root of both sides to find the ratio of the side lengths:

\[
\frac{s}{t} = \sqrt{\frac{32}{63}}
\]

separating the square roots of the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{32}{63}} = \frac{\sqrt{32}}{\sqrt{63}}
\]

simplifying the square roots:

\[
\sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \sqrt{63} = 3\sqrt{7}
\]

thus, the ratio becomes:

\[
\frac{s}{t} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3\sqrt{7}}
\]

rationalizing the denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{7}\):

\[
\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3\sqrt{7}} \times \frac{\sqrt{7}}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{4\sqrt{14}}{21}
\]

the ratio of the side lengths is now in the form \(\frac{a\sqrt{b}}{c}\) where \(a = 4\), \(b = 14\), and \(c = 21\).

finally, the sum \(a + b + c\) is:

\[
4 + 14 + 21 = 39
\]

\[
\boxed{39}
\]
