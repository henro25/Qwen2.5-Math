Reasoning: Let's tackle this problem step by step. it seems a bit tricky at first, but if i break it down, i can manage it.

first, let's understand what's given:

- jar a initially has 4 red buttons and 8 blue buttons. so, total buttons in jar a at the start are 4 + 8 = 12 buttons.

carla removes the same number of red buttons as blue buttons from jar a and puts them into jar b. let's denote the number of red buttons she removes as r and the number of blue buttons as b. according to the problem, r = b.

after removal, jar a now has 2/3 of its original number of buttons. the original number was 12, so 2/3 of 12 is 8 buttons remaining in jar a.

so, the number of buttons removed from jar a is the original 12 minus the remaining 8, which is 4 buttons. since she removed the same number of red and blue buttons, and the total removed is 4, that means she removed 2 red and 2 blue buttons (because 2 red + 2 blue = 4 buttons, and r = b = 2).

now, let's confirm this:

- buttons removed: 2 red and 2 blue.

- remaining in jar a: 4 - 2 = 2 red, and 8 - 2 = 6 blue. so, 2 + 6 = 8 buttons, which matches the 2/3 of original.

great, that checks out.

next, these 2 red and 2 blue buttons are placed into jar b, which was initially empty. so, jar b now has 2 red and 2 blue buttons.

now, carla is going to choose one button from jar a and one from jar b, and we need to find the probability that both chosen buttons are red.

to find this probability, i need to find the probability of choosing a red button from jar a and a red button from jar b, and then multiply these probabilities together because the choices are independent.

first, let's find the probability of choosing a red button from jar a.

jar a now has 2 red and 6 blue buttons, so total of 8 buttons.

probability of red from jar a = number of red buttons in jar a / total buttons in jar a = 2/8 = 1/4.

next, probability of choosing a red button from jar b.

jar b has 2 red and 2 blue buttons, so total of 4 buttons.

probability of red from jar b = number of red buttons in jar b / total buttons in jar b = 2/4 = 1/2.

now, since these two events are independent, the probability that both events happen is the product of their individual probabilities.

so, probability both buttons are red = (1/4) * (1/2) = 1/8.

wait, but let's double-check everything to make sure i haven't missed anything.

first, confirming the number of buttons removed: we said r = b, and total removed is 4, so r = b = 2. that seems correct.

remaining buttons in jar a: 4 - 2 = 2 red, and 8 - 2 = 6 blue. total 8 buttons, which is 2/3 of original 12. correct.

buttons in jar b: 2 red and 2 blue. total 4 buttons.

probability from jar a: 2 red out of 8 total, which is 1/4.

probability from jar b: 2 red out of 4 total, which is 1/2.

multiplying them: 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8.

seems straightforward, but maybe there's another way to look at it, just to confirm.

alternatively, we could consider all possible pairs of buttons chosen from jar a and jar b and find how many of those pairs are both red.

total ways to choose one from jar a and one from jar b: 8 (from a) * 4 (from b) = 32 possible pairs.

number of pairs where both are red: number of red in a (2) * number of red in b (2) = 4.

so, probability is 4/32 = 1/8.

same answer, so that confirms it.

alternatively, perhaps we can set up equations to solve for r and b, even though we already know r = b = 2.

let’s try that approach to see if it holds.

let r = number of red buttons removed from jar a.

since r = b, number of blue buttons removed is also r.

total buttons removed: r + r = 2r.

original total in jar a: 12.

remaining in jar a: 12 - 2r.

according to the problem, remaining buttons in jar a is 2/3 of original, which is 8.

so, 12 - 2r = 8.

solving for r: 12 - 8 = 2r → 4 = 2r → r = 2.

again, r = 2, which matches our earlier conclusion.

so, all methods point to the same answer: 1/8.

i think that's solid.

**final answer**
