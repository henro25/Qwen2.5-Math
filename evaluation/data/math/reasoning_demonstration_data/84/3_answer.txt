Answer: First, we determine the initial number of buttons in jar a: 4 red and 8 blue, totaling 12 buttons. carla removes the same number of red and blue buttons, denoted as \( r \) and \( b \) respectively, with \( r = b \). after removal, jar a has \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its original number of buttons, which is 8 buttons. therefore, the number of buttons removed is \( 12 - 8 = 4 \), implying \( r + b = 4 \) and since \( r = b \), we have \( r = b = 2 \).

thus, jar a now contains \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) red buttons and \( 8 - 2 = 6 \) blue buttons, totaling 8 buttons. jar b, initially empty, now contains 2 red and 2 blue buttons, totaling 4 buttons.

next, we calculate the probability of choosing a red button from both jars:

- probability of choosing a red button from jar a: 
  \[
  \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
  \]
- probability of choosing a red button from jar b: 
  \[
  \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
  \]

the combined probability of both events occurring is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8}
\]

thus, the probability that both chosen buttons are red is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{8}}
\]
