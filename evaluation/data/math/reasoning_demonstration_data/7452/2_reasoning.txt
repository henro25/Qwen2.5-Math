Reasoning: Alright, let's see. I have this problem: "What two-digit positive integer is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6?" Hmm, okay, so I need to find a two-digit number that's one more than a multiple of all these numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

First, I need to understand what it means to be one more than a multiple of these numbers. So, if a number is a multiple of, say, 2, that means it's divisible by 2 without any remainder. If it's one more than a multiple of 2, then when I divide it by 2, the remainder should be 1. The same logic applies to 3, 4, 5, and 6.

So, I'm looking for a number, let's call it N, such that:

- N divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1.

- N divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.

- N divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 1.

- N divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 1.

- N divided by 6 leaves a remainder of 1.

That means N - 1 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So, N - 1 is a common multiple of these numbers. To find the smallest such N, I should find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and then add 1 to it.

Wait, but I need a two-digit number. So, I should find the LCM of these numbers and then add 1, and check if it's a two-digit number. If not, maybe find multiples of that LCM and add 1 until I get a two-digit number.

First, let's find the LCM of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

I know that the LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of them.

Let's list the prime factors of each number:

- 2 is prime.

- 3 is prime.

- 4 is 2 squared.

- 5 is prime.

- 6 is 2 times 3.

To find the LCM, I take the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorization of these numbers.

So, for 2, the highest power is 2 squared from 4.

For 3, the highest power is 3 to the first power.

For 5, it's 5 to the first power.

So, LCM = 2^2 * 3 * 5 = 4 * 3 * 5 = 60.

Therefore, N - 1 = 60, so N = 61.

Is 61 a two-digit number? Yes, it's between 10 and 99.

But wait, is there any other two-digit number that satisfies this condition?

Let me check.

If N - 1 is a multiple of 60, then N - 1 could be 60, 120, 180, etc.

So, N could be 61, 121, 181, etc.

But I need a two-digit number, so 61 is the smallest one. Is there a larger two-digit number that also satisfies this?

Let's see, 60 * 2 = 120, so N = 121, but 121 is a three-digit number, which is beyond two digits.

So, 61 is the only two-digit number that is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Wait, but I should check if 61 indeed satisfies all the conditions.

Let's verify:

- 61 divided by 2: 61 / 2 = 30 with a remainder of 1.

- 61 divided by 3: 61 / 3 = 20 with a remainder of 1.

- 61 divided by 4: 61 / 4 = 15 with a remainder of 1.

- 61 divided by 5: 61 / 5 = 12 with a remainder of 1.

- 61 divided by 6: 61 / 6 = 10 with a remainder of 1.

Yes, in all cases, the remainder is 1, which matches the condition.

Therefore, 61 is the correct answer.

But wait, is there a way to approach this problem differently, maybe without finding the LCM?

Let me think.

Another approach could be to list out numbers that are one more than a multiple of 2, and see which of those also satisfy being one more than a multiple of 3, 4, 5, and 6.

So, numbers that are one more than a multiple of 2 are all odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99.

Now, among these, find numbers that are one more than a multiple of 3.

So, for a number to be one more than a multiple of 3, it should be congruent to 1 modulo 3.

Let's list numbers from the above list that satisfy this:

1 (1 mod 3), 4 (not in the list), 7 (7 mod 3 = 1), 10 (not in the list), 13 (13 mod 3 = 1), 16 (not in the list), 19 (19 mod 3 = 1), 22 (not in the list), 25 (25 mod 3 = 1), 28 (not in the list), 31 (31 mod 3 = 1), 34 (not in the list), 37 (37 mod 3 = 1), 40 (not in the list), 43 (43 mod 3 = 1), 46 (not in the list), 49 (49 mod 3 = 1), 52 (not in the list), 55 (55 mod 3 = 1), 58 (not in the list), 61 (61 mod 3 = 1), 64 (not in the list), 67 (67 mod 3 = 1), 70 (not in the list), 73 (73 mod 3 = 1), 76 (not in the list), 79 (79 mod 3 = 1), 82 (not in the list), 85 (85 mod 3 = 1), 88 (not in the list), 91 (91 mod 3 = 1), 94 (not in the list), 97 (97 mod 3 = 1), 100 (not in the list).

Wait, but some of these numbers are not in the initial list because they aren't odd. For example, 4 is not in the list of numbers that are one more than a multiple of 2, which are all odd numbers.

So, from the odd numbers, the ones that are also one more than a multiple of 3 are: 1, 7, 13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43, 49, 55, 61, 67, 73, 79, 85, 91, 97.

Now, from this list, I need to find numbers that are also one more than a multiple of 4.

So, numbers that are one more than a multiple of 4: numbers that are 1 mod 4.

Looking at the list: 1, 7, 13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43, 49, 55, 61, 67, 73, 79, 85, 91, 97.

Which of these are 1 mod 4?

1 mod 4 is 1.

7 mod 4 is 3.

13 mod 4 is 1.

19 mod 4 is 3.

25 mod 4 is 1.

31 mod 4 is 3.

37 mod 4 is 1.

43 mod 4 is 3.

49 mod 4 is 1.

55 mod 4 is 3.

61 mod 4 is 1.

67 mod 4 is 3.

73 mod 4 is 1.

79 mod 4 is 3.

85 mod 4 is 1.

91 mod 4 is 3.

97 mod 4 is 1.

So, the numbers that are 1 mod 4 are: 1, 13, 25, 37, 49, 61, 73, 85, 97.

Now, from this list, I need numbers that are also one more than a multiple of 5, i.e., 1 mod 5.

Looking at the list: 1, 13, 25, 37, 49, 61, 73, 85, 97.

Which of these are 1 mod 5?

1 mod 5 is 1.

13 mod 5 is 3.

25 mod 5 is 0.

37 mod 5 is 2.

49 mod 5 is 4.

61 mod 5 is 1.

73 mod 5 is 3.

85 mod 5 is 0.

97 mod 5 is 2.

So, only 1 and 61 are 1 mod 5.

But 1 is not a two-digit number, so 61 is the only candidate left.

Finally, I need to check if 61 is one more than a multiple of 6.

61 - 1 = 60, and 60 is divisible by 6, since 6*10=60.

Therefore, 61 satisfies all the conditions.

So, the answer is 61.
