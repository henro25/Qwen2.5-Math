Reasoning: Alright, so I've got this problem here: 3△₄ = △2₁₁, and I need to find out what digit △ stands for, where △ is a digit from 0 to 9. Okay, let's break this down.

First off, I see subscripts here: 4 and 11. I think those might represent different number bases. Like, in math, when you have a number with a subscript, it usually indicates the base of the number system being used. So, 3△₄ would be a number in base 4, and △2₁₁ would be a number in base 11.

So, let's confirm that. In base 4, the digits can only be 0, 1, 2, or 3. But here, we have a digit △, which is supposed to be between 0 and 9. Wait, that doesn't make sense because in base 4, digits can't be higher than 3. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe the subscript indicates the base, but the digits themselves can still be higher than the base if there's a placeholder or something. But no, in any base system, each digit has to be less than the base. So in base 4, digits can only be 0, 1, 2, or 3. So if △ is a digit between 0 and 9, but in base 4, it has to be less than 4, so △ can only be 0, 1, 2, or 3 in 3△₄.

But in △2₁₁, since it's base 11, digits can go up to 10, right? So △ can be up to 10 in base 11, but the problem says it's a single digit from 0 to 9, so that should be fine.

Okay, so let's try to convert both numbers to decimal (base 10) and set them equal to each other to solve for △.

Starting with 3△₄. In base 4, the rightmost digit is the units place (4^0), and the next one is the fours place (4^1). So, 3△₄ = 3*4^1 + △*4^0 = 12 + △.

Now, △2₁₁. In base 11, the rightmost digit is the units place (11^0), and the next one is the elevens place (11^1). So, △2₁₁ = △*11^1 + 2*11^0 = 11△ + 2.

So, setting them equal: 12 + △ = 11△ + 2.

Now, let's solve for △. Subtract △ from both sides: 12 = 10△ + 2.

Then, subtract 2 from both sides: 10 = 10△.

So, △ = 1.

Wait, but I should check if this makes sense in the original equation.

Plugging △ = 1 back in:

3△₄ = 31₄ = 3*4 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13.

△2₁₁ = 12₁₁ = 1*11 + 2 = 11 + 2 = 13.

Okay, they match. So, △ is 1.

But wait, let's double-check if there are any other possible values for △. Since △ has to be a single digit from 0 to 9, and in base 4, △ can only be 0, 1, 2, or 3, but we got △ = 1, which fits within both constraints.

So, the answer should be △ = 1.
