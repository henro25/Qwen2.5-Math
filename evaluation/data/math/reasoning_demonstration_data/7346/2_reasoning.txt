Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: find x, given that x is nonzero and the numbers {x}, floor(x), and x form an arithmetic sequence in that order. and they define {x} as x minus floor(x). hmm, okay, let's break this down.

first off, i need to recall what an arithmetic sequence is. it's a sequence where the difference between consecutive terms is constant. so, in this case, the difference between the first and second term should be the same as the difference between the second and third term.

so, we have {x}, floor(x), and x in that order, and they form an arithmetic sequence. that means:

floor(x) - {x} = x - floor(x)

let me write that down:

floor(x) - {x} = x - floor(x)

now, {x} is defined as x - floor(x), right? so, i can substitute that in:

floor(x) - (x - floor(x)) = x - floor(x)

simplify the left side:

floor(x) - x + floor(x) = x - floor(x)

combine like terms:

2*floor(x) - x = x - floor(x)

now, i can bring all terms involving floor(x) and x to one side:

2*floor(x) + floor(x) = x + x

which simplifies to:

3*floor(x) = 2x

so, floor(x) = (2/3)x

alright, now floor(x) is the greatest integer less than or equal to x. so, floor(x) is an integer, assuming x is not an integer itself, but wait, if x is an integer, then {x} = 0, but the problem says x is nonzero, and {x} is part of the sequence.

let me think about this. if x is an integer, then {x} = 0, floor(x) = x, and the sequence would be 0, x, x, which would have differences x - 0 = x and x - x = 0. for these to be equal, x must be 0, but x is nonzero. so, x cannot be an integer.

therefore, x is not an integer, and floor(x) is the integer part of x, and {x} is the fractional part, between 0 and 1.

so, floor(x) = (2/3)x

since floor(x) is an integer, let's denote floor(x) as n, where n is an integer.

so, n = (2/3)x

then, x = (3/2)n

now, since floor(x) = n, that means n ≤ x < n + 1

substitute x = (3/2)n into that inequality:

n ≤ (3/2)n < n + 1

let's solve the left part first:

n ≤ (3/2)n

subtract n from both sides:

0 ≤ (1/2)n

so, n ≥ 0

now, the right part:

(3/2)n < n + 1

subtract n from both sides:

(1/2)n < 1

multiply both sides by 2:

n < 2

so, combining n ≥ 0 and n < 2, and n is an integer, possible values for n are 0 and 1.

but wait, x is nonzero, and x = (3/2)n, so if n = 0, x = 0, which is not allowed. so, n must be 1.

therefore, n = 1

then, x = (3/2)*1 = 3/2

now, let's check if this satisfies the original condition.

compute {x} = x - floor(x) = 3/2 - 1 = 1/2

so, the sequence is {x} = 1/2, floor(x) = 1, x = 3/2

check if it's an arithmetic sequence:

difference between floor(x) and {x}: 1 - 1/2 = 1/2

difference between x and floor(x): 3/2 - 1 = 1/2

yes, both differences are equal to 1/2, so it is an arithmetic sequence.

therefore, x = 3/2 is the solution.

but wait, the problem says "find x," given that x is nonzero and the numbers {x}, floor(x), and x form an arithmetic sequence in that order.

is there any other possible solution?

well, we considered n = 1, but n can also be negative integers, right? because floor(x) can be negative if x is negative.

let me check that case.

if n is negative, say n = -1

then x = (3/2)*(-1) = -3/2

compute {x} = x - floor(x) = -3/2 - (-2) = -3/2 + 2 = 1/2

sequence: {x} = 1/2, floor(x) = -2, x = -3/2

check differences:

floor(x) - {x} = -2 - 1/2 = -2.5

x - floor(x) = -3/2 - (-2) = -3/2 + 2 = 1/2

these are not equal, so it doesn't satisfy the condition.

similarly, for n = -2

x = (3/2)*(-2) = -3

but floor(x) = -3, {x} = x - floor(x) = -3 - (-3) = 0

sequence: 0, -3, -3

differences: -3 - 0 = -3 and -3 - (-3) = 0, not equal.

so, n = -1 and n = -2 don't work.

what about n = 2?

wait, earlier we had n < 2, but n can be up to less than 2, so n = 1 is the only positive integer in that range.

therefore, the only solution is x = 3/2.

wait a minute, but let's consider if there could be non-integer n.

no, n is floor(x), which is an integer.

hence, the only solution is x = 3/2.

but just to be thorough, let's see if there's any other way to approach this problem.

alternative approach:

given that {x}, floor(x), x form an arithmetic sequence.

so, the common difference d is floor(x) - {x} and also x - floor(x).

therefore, floor(x) - {x} = x - floor(x)

which leads to the same equation as before: 2 floor(x) - x = x - floor(x), so 3 floor(x) = 2x, hence floor(x) = (2/3)x

again, setting floor(x) = n, x = (3/2)n, and n ≤ x < n +1, etc., leading to n =1, x=3/2.

alternatively, maybe consider expressing x in terms of its integer and fractional parts.

let x = n + f, where n = floor(x), and f = {x}, with 0 ≤ f <1.

then, the sequence is f, n, n + f

for these to be in arithmetic sequence:

n - f = (n + f) - n => n - f = f => n = 2f

but n is an integer, f is between 0 and 1.

so, n = 2f, with n integer, and 0 ≤ f <1.

then, 0 ≤ f <1, so 0 ≤ 2f <2, so n can be 0 or 1.

if n =0, then f=0, but then x =0, which is not allowed.

if n=1, then f=1/2

thus, x =1 + 1/2 =3/2, which matches our earlier solution.

therefore, x=3/2 is the only solution.

another way: suppose the common difference is d.

then, the sequence is {x}, floor(x), x.

so, floor(x) = {x} + d

and x = floor(x) + d = {x} + 2d

but {x} = x - floor(x)

so, floor(x) = (x - floor(x)) + d => floor(x) = x - floor(x) + d => 2 floor(x) = x + d

and x = floor(x) + d

from the second equation, d = x - floor(x) = {x}

substitute into the first equation:

2 floor(x) = x + {x} = floor(x) + {x} + {x} = floor(x) + 2{x}

but {x} = x - floor(x), so 2 floor(x) = floor(x) + 2(x - floor(x)) => 2 floor(x) = floor(x) + 2x - 2 floor(x) => 2 floor(x) = 2x - floor(x)

add floor(x) to both sides: 3 floor(x) = 2x, which is the same as before.

hence, again, floor(x) = (2/3)x, leading to x=3/2 when n=1.

therefore, the only solution is x=3/2.
