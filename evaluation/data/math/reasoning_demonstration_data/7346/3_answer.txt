Answer: Given that \( x \) is nonzero and the numbers \(\{x\}\), \(\lfloor x \rfloor\), and \( x \) form an arithmetic sequence in that order, we need to find \( x \). here, \(\{x\} = x - \lfloor x \rfloor\).

first, we set up the condition for an arithmetic sequence:
\[
\lfloor x \rfloor - \{x\} = x - \lfloor x \rfloor
\]
substituting \(\{x\} = x - \lfloor x \rfloor\):
\[
\lfloor x \rfloor - (x - \lfloor x \rfloor) = x - \lfloor x \rfloor
\]
simplifying:
\[
\lfloor x \rfloor - x + \lfloor x \rfloor = x - \lfloor x \rfloor
\]
\[
2\lfloor x \rfloor - x = x - \lfloor x \rfloor
\]
\[
3\lfloor x \rfloor = 2x
\]
let \(\lfloor x \rfloor = n\), where \( n \) is an integer:
\[
n = \frac{2}{3}x \implies x = \frac{3}{2}n
\]
since \( n \leq x < n + 1 \):
\[
n \leq \frac{3}{2}n < n + 1
\]
solving the inequalities:
\[
n \leq \frac{3}{2}n \implies 0 \leq \frac{1}{2}n \implies n \geq 0
\]
\[
\frac{3}{2}n < n + 1 \implies \frac{1}{2}n < 1 \implies n < 2
\]
thus, \( n \) can be 0 or 1. since \( x \neq 0 \), \( n \neq 0 \), so \( n = 1 \):
\[
x = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 1 = \frac{3}{2}
\]
verifying:
\[
\{x\} = x - \lfloor x \rfloor = \frac{3}{2} - 1 = \frac{1}{2}
\]
the sequence is \(\left\{\frac{1}{2}, 1, \frac{3}{2}\right\}\), which is arithmetic with common difference \(\frac{1}{2}\).

therefore, the solution is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{3}{2}}
\]
