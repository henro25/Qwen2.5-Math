Problem: My friend and I both have the same math homework one day. I work at a rate of $p$ problems per hour and it takes me $t$ hours to finish my homework. My friend works at a rate of $2p-4$ problems per hour and it only takes him $t-2$ hours to finish his homework. Given that $p$ and $t$ are positive whole numbers and I do more than $10$ problems per hour, how many problems did I do?
