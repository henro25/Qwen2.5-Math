Reasoning: 
So i have this quadratic equation here: 2x² - 5x - 4 = 0. i need to find its roots in the form x = (m ± √n)/p, where m, n, and p are positive integers with no common factors other than 1. and specifically, i need to find the value of n.

first off, i remember that for a quadratic equation of the form ax² + bx + c = 0, the roots can be found using the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a). that seems like the way to go here.

so, in this equation, a = 2, b = -5, and c = -4. plugging these into the quadratic formula:

x = -(-5) ± √((-5)² - 4*2*(-4)) / (2*2)

simplifying that:

x = 5 ± √(25 - 4*2*(-4)) / 4

wait, the expression inside the square root is the discriminant, which is b² - 4ac. let me calculate that carefully.

first, b² = (-5)² = 25.

then, 4ac = 4*2*(-4) = 8*(-4) = -32.

so, b² - 4ac = 25 - (-32) = 25 + 32 = 57.

therefore, the expression under the square root is 57, which is √57.

so, the roots are x = (5 ± √57)/4.

now, the problem states that the roots can be written in the form (m ± √n)/p, where m, n, and p are positive integers with a greatest common divisor of 1.

in my expression, m is 5, n is 57, and p is 4. but i need to make sure that m, n, and p have no common factors other than 1.

let's check the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 5, 57, and 4.

first, gcd of 5 and 4 is 1, since 5 is prime and doesn't divide 4.

then, gcd of 1 and 57 is still 1.

so, 5, 57, and 4 have a gcd of 1, which satisfies the condition.

therefore, n is 57.

wait a minute, but the problem specifically asks for n, which is under the square root, and i have √57.

is there anything else i need to consider? maybe i should check if 57 can be simplified further, like if it has any square factors.

let's factor 57: 57 = 3 * 19.

both 3 and 19 are prime numbers, so √57 cannot be simplified further. that means √57 is already in its simplest radical form.

therefore, n is indeed 57.

just to make sure, let me recap:

given 2x² - 5x - 4 = 0,

using quadratic formula: x = [5 ± √(25 - 4*2*(-4))]/4 = [5 ± √(25 + 32)]/4 = [5 ± √57]/4.

since 5, 57, and 4 have no common factors other than 1, n is 57.

i don't think there's any other step i need to take here. it seems straightforward.

maybe i should also consider if there's another way to approach this problem, just to double-check.

alternatively, i could try factoring the quadratic, but 2x² - 5x - 4 doesn't look easily factorable with integer coefficients. let me see:

looking for two numbers that multiply to 2*(-4) = -8 and add up to -5.

possible pairs: -8 and 1 (sum -7), -4 and 2 (sum -2), -2 and 4 (sum 2). none of these add up to -5.

so, factoring doesn't seem feasible here, which confirms that using the quadratic formula is the right approach.

therefore, i'm confident that n is 57.
