Reasoning: So i've got this problem: "how many pairs of positive integers (m, n) satisfy m² + n < 22?" okay, let's see. i'm supposed to find all positive integer pairs (m, n) where m squared plus n is less than 22. positive integers mean m and n are both 1 or larger, right? so m and n are at least 1.

first, maybe i should think about possible values of m. since m is a positive integer, m can be 1, 2, 3, and so on, but m squared has to be less than 22, because even when n is 1, m² + 1 has to be less than 22. so m squared has to be less than 22 - 1, which is 21. wait, but n can be larger than 1, so actually, m squared can be up to 22 - n - 1, but that seems messy. maybe it's better to fix m and see what n can be.

let me try that approach. for each possible m, find the range of n that satisfies the inequality.

so, m starts at 1.

when m = 1, m² = 1. then 1 + n < 22, so n < 21. since n is a positive integer, n can be from 1 to 20. so there are 20 possible n values when m = 1.

next, m = 2. m² = 4. then 4 + n < 22, so n < 18. n can be from 1 to 17. that's 17 possible n values.

m = 3. m² = 9. then 9 + n < 22, so n < 13. n can be from 1 to 12. that's 12 possible n values.

m = 4. m² = 16. then 16 + n < 22, so n < 6. n can be from 1 to 5. that's 5 possible n values.

m = 5. m² = 25. then 25 + n < 22. wait, 25 is already greater than 22, so there are no solutions for m = 5 because even when n = 1, 25 + 1 = 26, which is not less than 22.

so m can only be from 1 to 4.

now, to find the total number of pairs, i can add up the possible n values for each m.

so total pairs = 20 (for m=1) + 17 (for m=2) + 12 (for m=3) + 5 (for m=4).

let me add those up: 20 + 17 is 37, plus 12 is 49, plus 5 is 54.

wait, is that correct? let me double-check.

for m=1: n < 21, so n = 1 to 20, that's 20 values.

for m=2: n < 18, so n = 1 to 17, that's 17 values.

for m=3: n < 13, so n = 1 to 12, that's 12 values.

for m=4: n < 6, so n = 1 to 5, that's 5 values.

total is indeed 20 + 17 + 12 + 5 = 54.

but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe to verify.

another way could be to consider the inequality m² + n < 22, which can be rewritten as n < 22 - m².

since n is a positive integer, n can be from 1 up to floor(22 - m² - 1), but wait, no. since n < 22 - m², and n is a positive integer, n can be from 1 up to floor(22 - m² - 1), but that seems off.

actually, since n has to be less than 22 - m², and n is a positive integer, the maximum n can be is floor(22 - m² - 1), but i'm getting confused.

wait, no. if n < 22 - m², and n is a positive integer, then n can be from 1 up to floor(22 - m² - 1), but that doesn't make sense. actually, n can be from 1 up to floor(22 - m² - 1), but that seems incorrect.

let me correct that. if n < 22 - m², and n is a positive integer, then n can be from 1 up to floor(22 - m² - 1), but that doesn't seem right.

wait, no. if n is less than 22 - m², and n is a positive integer, then the maximum n can be is floor(22 - m² - 1), but that seems off. maybe it's better to think of it as n can be from 1 up to floor(22 - m² - 1), but that doesn't make sense.

actually, if n < 22 - m², and n is a positive integer, then n can be from 1 up to floor(22 - m² - 1), but that's not correct.

let me think differently. if n < 22 - m², and n is a positive integer, then the number of possible n values is floor(22 - m² - 1), but that still seems off.

wait, perhaps i should consider that n can be at most floor(22 - m² - 1), but that doesn't make sense because if n < 22 - m², then n can be up to 22 - m² - 1, assuming 22 - m² is not an integer, but since m and n are integers, 22 - m² is an integer if m is an integer.

so, n can be from 1 to 22 - m² - 1, but again, that seems off.

let me try plugging in m=1 again. for m=1, n < 21, so n can be 1 to 20, which is 20 values. that matches my earlier calculation.

for m=2, n < 18, so n can be 1 to 17, which is 17 values.

for m=3, n < 13, so n can be 1 to 12, which is 12 values.

for m=4, n < 6, so n can be 1 to 5, which is 5 values.

for m=5, n < 22 - 25 = -3, which is not possible since n is positive.

so, total pairs are indeed 20 + 17 + 12 + 5 = 54.

wait, but let me see if there's a formula or a smarter way to calculate this without adding up each case.

perhaps i can express the total number of pairs as the sum from m=1 to m=4 of (22 - m² - 1), since n can be from 1 to 22 - m² - 1.

so, total pairs = σ (from m=1 to m=4) of (21 - m²)

which is (21 - 1) + (21 - 4) + (21 - 9) + (21 - 16) = 20 + 17 + 12 + 5 = 54, which matches my earlier calculation.

alternatively, i could think of it as the area under the curve m² < 22 - n, but that seems more complicated for integer values.

another way is to consider that for each m, n can be up to 21 - m², since n < 22 - m² and n is at least 1.

wait, but earlier i had n < 22 - m², which for positive integers means n ≤ floor(22 - m² - 1), but that doesn't make sense.

actually, since m and n are integers, n < 22 - m² is equivalent to n ≤ 21 - m².

so, the number of possible n for each m is 21 - m².

but wait, for m=1, 21 - 1 = 20, which matches.

for m=2, 21 - 4 = 17.

for m=3, 21 - 9 = 12.

for m=4, 21 - 16 = 5.

and for m=5, 21 - 25 = -4, which means no solutions, as expected.

so, total pairs = σ (from m=1 to m=4) (21 - m²) = 20 + 17 + 12 + 5 = 54.

i think this confirms that 54 is the correct answer.

but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's a general formula for this kind of problem.

suppose we have m² + n < c, where c is a constant, and m and n are positive integers.

then, for each m, n can be from 1 to floor(c - m² - 1), but again, in our case, since c is 22 and m and n are positive integers, n can be from 1 to floor(22 - m² - 1), but that doesn't seem right.

wait, no. if n < c - m², and n is a positive integer, then n can be from 1 to floor(c - m² - 1), but in our earlier calculation, for m=1, n can be up to 20, which is 21 - 1, but 21 - m² = 21 - 1 = 20, which matches.

similarly, for m=2, 21 - 4 = 17, which matches.

so, total pairs = σ (from m=1 to m_max) (21 - m²), where m_max is the largest m such that m² < c.

in our case, c=22, so m_max is floor(sqrt(21)), since m² < 22, and m is a positive integer.

wait, sqrt(22) is approximately 4.69, so m_max is 4, as we have m=1,2,3,4.

so, general formula is sum from m=1 to floor(sqrt(c - 1)) of (c - 1 - m²).

in our case, c=22, so sum from m=1 to floor(sqrt(21)) of (21 - m²).

which is sum from m=1 to 4 of (21 - m²) = 20 + 17 + 12 + 5 = 54.

i think that's solid.

alternatively, if i wanted to find a closed-form expression for the sum, it would be sum from m=1 to k of (c - 1 - m²), where k is floor(sqrt(c - 1)).

this can be rewritten as k*(c - 1) - sum from m=1 to k of m².

sum of m² from m=1 to k is (k(k + 1)(2k + 1))/6.

so, total pairs = k*(c - 1) - (k(k + 1)(2k + 1))/6.

in our case, c=22, k=4.

so, total pairs = 4*21 - (4*5*9)/6 = 84 - (180)/6 = 84 - 30 = 54.

again, 54.

this confirms the earlier result.

just to be extra sure, maybe i can list out some of the pairs.

for m=1:

n from 1 to 20: (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,20): 20 pairs.

for m=2:

n from 1 to 17: (2,1), (2,2), ..., (2,17): 17 pairs.

for m=3:

n from 1 to 12: (3,1), (3,2), ..., (3,12): 12 pairs.

for m=4:

n from 1 to 5: (4,1), (4,2), ..., (4,5): 5 pairs.

total: 20 + 17 + 12 + 5 = 54.

yes, that seems correct.

i don't think i've missed anything here. the possible m values are limited to 1,2,3,4, and for each m, the n values are correctly bounded by the inequality m² + n < 22.

therefore, the total number of positive integer pairs (m, n) that satisfy m² + n < 22 is 54.

**final answer**

the total number of pairs is \boxed{54}.
