Answer: To determine the number of pairs of positive integers \((m, n)\) that satisfy \(m^2 + n < 22\), we consider each possible value of \(m\) and find the corresponding range of \(n\).

1. for \(m = 1\):
   \[
   1^2 + n < 22 \implies 1 + n < 22 \implies n < 21
   \]
   thus, \(n\) can be any integer from 1 to 20, giving 20 possible pairs.

2. for \(m = 2\):
   \[
   2^2 + n < 22 \implies 4 + n < 22 \implies n < 18
   \]
   thus, \(n\) can be any integer from 1 to 17, giving 17 possible pairs.

3. for \(m = 3\):
   \[
   3^2 + n < 22 \implies 9 + n < 22 \implies n < 13
   \]
   thus, \(n\) can be any integer from 1 to 12, giving 12 possible pairs.

4. for \(m = 4\):
   \[
   4^2 + n < 22 \implies 16 + n < 22 \implies n < 6
   \]
   thus, \(n\) can be any integer from 1 to 5, giving 5 possible pairs.

5. for \(m \geq 5\):
   \[
   m^2 \geq 25 \implies m^2 + n \geq 25 + 1 = 26 > 22
   \]
   thus, there are no solutions for \(m \geq 5\).

summing up all possible pairs:
\[
20 + 17 + 12 + 5 = 54
\]

therefore, the total number of pairs \((m, n)\) that satisfy \(m^2 + n < 22\) is \(\boxed{54}\).
