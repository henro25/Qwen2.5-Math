Reasoning: So i've got this problem here. it says that there's a real function f with a special property: whenever a, b, and n are positive integers such that a + b equals 2 to the power of n, then f(a) plus f(b) equals n squared. and i need to find f(2002). hmm, interesting.

first off, i need to understand what this property is telling me. it seems like for any a and b that add up to 2^n, their function values add up to n squared. so, if i can find pairs (a, b) where a + b is a power of 2, i can relate f(a) and f(b) through this equation.

let me try to see if there's a pattern or a way to express f(a) in terms of a directly.

maybe i can start by considering specific values of n and see what that tells me about f.

let's take n = 1. then 2^1 = 2. so, a + b = 2.

the positive integer pairs (a, b) that satisfy this are (1,1). so, f(1) + f(1) = 1^2 = 1.

that means 2*f(1) = 1, so f(1) = 1/2.

okay, that's one value.

now, n = 2. then 2^2 = 4. so, a + b = 4.

possible pairs: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1).

so, f(1) + f(3) = 4, and f(2) + f(2) = 4.

from earlier, f(1) = 1/2, so 1/2 + f(3) = 4, which means f(3) = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2.

and for f(2) + f(2) = 4, so 2*f(2) = 4, hence f(2) = 2.

alright, so now i have f(1) = 1/2, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 7/2.

let me try n = 3. 2^3 = 8. so, a + b = 8.

possible pairs: (1,7), (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2), (7,1).

so, f(1) + f(7) = 9 (since n=3, n^2=9), and similarly for other pairs.

we already know f(1) = 1/2, so f(7) = 9 - 1/2 = 17/2.

similarly, f(2) + f(6) = 9, and f(2) = 2, so f(6) = 9 - 2 = 7.

f(3) + f(5) = 9, and f(3) = 7/2, so f(5) = 9 - 7/2 = 11/2.

f(4) + f(4) = 9, so 2*f(4) = 9, hence f(4) = 9/2.

so far, i have:

f(1) = 1/2

f(2) = 2

f(3) = 7/2

f(4) = 9/2

f(5) = 11/2

f(6) = 7

f(7) = 17/2

hmm, i see some pattern here.

let me see if i can generalize this.

looking at the values:

for a = 1: 1/2

a = 2: 2 = 4/2

a = 3: 7/2

a = 4: 9/2

a = 5: 11/2

a = 6: 14/2 = 7

a = 7: 17/2

wait a minute, let's see if there's a relation between a and f(a).

let me consider writing f(a) in terms of a.

looking at the values:

a | f(a)

1 | 1/2

2 | 4/2

3 | 7/2

4 | 9/2

5 | 11/2

6 | 14/2

7 | 17/2

hmm, the denominators are all 2, so maybe f(a) = (something)/2.

looking at the numerators:

1, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 17.

is there a pattern here? let's see:

from 1 to 4: +3

4 to 7: +3

7 to 9: +2

9 to 11: +2

11 to 14: +3

14 to 17: +3

hmm, that's not a constant difference. maybe it's related to powers of 2.

let me think differently. maybe f(a) depends on the highest power of 2 less than or equal to a.

for example, for a = 1, the highest power of 2 less than or equal to 1 is 1 (which is 2^0), but 2^1 = 2 >1.

wait, 2^0 =1, which is equal to 1.

for a=2, highest power of 2 less than or equal to 2 is 2 (2^1).

a=3, highest power is 2.

a=4, highest power is 4 (2^2).

a=5, highest power is 4.

a=6, highest power is 4.

a=7, highest power is 4.

a=8, highest power is 8 (2^3).

wait, maybe f(a) is related to the exponent of the highest power of 2 less than or equal to a.

for a=1: 2^0=1, exponent=0, but f(1)=1/2.

a=2: 2^1=2, exponent=1, f(2)=2.

a=3: 2^1=2, exponent=1, f(3)=7/2.

a=4: 2^2=4, exponent=2, f(4)=9/2.

a=5: 2^2=4, exponent=2, f(5)=11/2.

a=6: 2^2=4, exponent=2, f(6)=7.

a=7: 2^2=4, exponent=2, f(7)=17/2.

a=8: 2^3=8, exponent=3, f(8)= ?

wait, i don't have f(8) yet.

but perhaps there's a different approach.

let me think about binary representations.

2002 is the number i need to find f for, and 2002 in binary is... let's calculate that.

2002 divided by 2 is 1001, remainder 0.

1001 divided by 2 is 500, remainder 1.

500 divided by 2 is 250, remainder 0.

250 divided by 2 is 125, remainder 0.

125 divided by 2 is 62, remainder 1.

62 divided by 2 is 31, remainder 0.

31 divided by 2 is 15, remainder 1.

15 divided by 2 is 7, remainder 1.

7 divided by 2 is 3, remainder 1.

3 divided by 2 is 1, remainder 1.

1 divided by 2 is 0, remainder 1.

so, writing the remainders from bottom up: 11111010010.

so, 2002 in binary is 11111010010.

i'm not sure if that helps directly, but maybe thinking in terms of binary will be useful.

alternatively, maybe i can think recursively or find a general formula for f(a).

let me try to find a general expression for f(a).

given that for any a and b with a + b = 2^n, f(a) + f(b) = n^2.

i need to find f(2002). so, perhaps i can express 2002 in terms of powers of 2.

wait, 2002 is less than 2048, which is 2^11, since 2^11 = 2048.

so, 2^11 = 2048, and 2002 + 46 = 2048.

so, a = 2002, b = 46, n = 11.

therefore, f(2002) + f(46) = 11^2 = 121.

so, f(2002) = 121 - f(46).

but i don't know f(46) yet.

perhaps i can find f(46) in a similar way.

find a power of 2 that's greater than 46.

2^6 = 64, which is greater than 46.

so, 64 - 46 = 18.

therefore, a = 46, b = 18, n = 6.

so, f(46) + f(18) = 6^2 = 36.

thus, f(46) = 36 - f(18).

now, need f(18).

find a power of 2 greater than 18, which is 32 (2^5).

so, 32 - 18 = 14.

thus, f(18) + f(14) = 25, since n=5, n^2=25.

therefore, f(18) = 25 - f(14).

now, find f(14).

find a power of 2 greater than 14, which is 16 (2^4).

so, 16 - 14 = 2.

thus, f(14) + f(2) = 16, since n=4, n^2=16.

we know f(2) = 2, so f(14) = 16 - 2 = 14.

therefore, f(14) = 14.

now, go back to f(18) = 25 - f(14) = 25 - 14 = 11.

then, f(46) = 36 - f(18) = 36 - 11 = 25.

finally, f(2002) = 121 - f(46) = 121 - 25 = 96.

wait, is that right?

let me check my steps again.

we had:

f(2002) + f(46) = 121.

f(46) + f(18) = 36.

f(18) + f(14) = 25.

f(14) + f(2) = 16.

given f(2) = 2, so f(14) = 14.

then f(18) = 25 - 14 = 11.

f(46) = 36 - 11 = 25.

then f(2002) = 121 - 25 = 96.

seems consistent.

but let's verify with another approach to be sure.

maybe there's a general formula for f(a).

let me try to find a general expression.

given that for a + b = 2^n, f(a) + f(b) = n^2.

suppose i fix a and vary b, with b = 2^n - a.

but that might not help directly.

alternatively, perhaps f(a) can be expressed as a function involving the binary representation of a.

alternatively, maybe f(a) is related to the number of times a appears in certain pairs.

alternatively, perhaps f(a) is proportional to a, but that doesn't seem to fit the values i have.

wait, let's see:

from earlier:

f(1) = 1/2

f(2) = 2

f(3) = 7/2

f(4) = 9/2

f(5) = 11/2

f(6) = 7

f(7) = 17/2

f(8) = ?

i need to find f(8).

find a power of 2 greater than 8, which is 16 (2^4).

so, 16 - 8 = 8.

thus, f(8) + f(8) = 16, so 2*f(8) = 16, hence f(8) = 8.

wait, but earlier when n=3, a + b = 8, and we have f(4) + f(4) = 9, but n=3, n^2=9.

wait, but 2^3 = 8, so a + b = 8, and for a = b = 4, f(4) + f(4) = 9, so f(4) = 9/2.

wait, but above for a=8, 16 - 8 = 8, so f(8) + f(8) = 16, hence f(8)=8.

that seems inconsistent with the earlier pattern.

wait, perhaps i need to think differently.

let me consider that for a + b = 2^n, f(a) + f(b) = n^2.

maybe f(a) is related to the number of times a appears in such pairs.

alternatively, perhaps f(a) can be expressed as the sum over certain n.

alternatively, perhaps i can think in terms of binary digits or something.

wait, maybe f(a) is equal to the number of 1's in the binary representation of a times something.

looking back at the values:

a=1: binary 1, one '1', f(a)=1/2.

a=2: 10, one '1', f(a)=2.

a=3: 11, two '1's, f(a)=7/2.

a=4: 100, one '1', f(a)=9/2.

a=5: 101, two '1's, f(a)=11/2.

a=6: 110, two '1's, f(a)=7.

a=7: 111, three '1's, f(a)=17/2.

a=8: 1000, one '1', f(a)=8.

hmm, not sure if that helps.

alternatively, perhaps f(a) can be expressed in terms of log base 2 of a, but a is not necessarily a power of 2.

alternatively, maybe f(a) is related to the highest power of 2 less than or equal to a, say 2^k, and then f(a) = k^2 - f(2^k - a).

wait, that seems recursive.

wait, let's see:

given a + b = 2^n, then f(a) + f(b) = n^2.

so, f(a) = n^2 - f(b), where b = 2^n - a.

so, if i can express b in terms of a, i can write f(a) in terms of f(b).

but this is recursive, and might not lead directly to a closed-form expression.

alternatively, maybe i can consider writing f(a) as n^2 - f(2^n - a), where n is such that 2^n > a.

but again, this seems circular.

maybe i need to think about the binary representation more carefully.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that f(a) is equal to the number of times a appears in these pairs multiplied by something.

alternatively, maybe f(a) can be expressed as a sum over certain n.

alternatively, perhaps f(a) is equal to the number of ones in the binary representation times something.

alternatively, maybe f(a) is related to the position of a in the binary tree of subsets or something.

this is getting a bit too vague.

maybe i should consider building a table for more values to see a pattern.

let me try to compute more f(a) values.

we have:

f(1) = 1/2

f(2) = 2

f(3) = 7/2

f(4) = 9/2

f(5) = 11/2

f(6) = 7

f(7) = 17/2

f(8) = 8

f(9): let's compute f(9).

find a power of 2 greater than 9, which is 16 (2^4).

so, 16 - 9 = 7.

thus, f(9) + f(7) = 16, since n=4, n^2=16.

we have f(7)=17/2, so f(9)=16 - 17/2 = 32/2 - 17/2 = 15/2.

similarly, f(10): 16 - 10 = 6.

so, f(10) + f(6) = 16.

we have f(6)=7, so f(10)=16 -7=9.

f(11): 16 -11 =5.

f(11) + f(5)=16.

f(5)=11/2, so f(11)=16 -11/2 =32/2 -11/2=21/2.

f(12): 16 -12=4.

f(12)+f(4)=16.

f(4)=9/2, so f(12)=16 -9/2=32/2 -9/2=23/2.

f(13): 16 -13=3.

f(13)+f(3)=16.

f(3)=7/2, so f(13)=16 -7/2=32/2 -7/2=25/2.

f(14): as before, f(14)=14.

f(15): 16-15=1.

f(15)+f(1)=16.

f(1)=1/2, so f(15)=16 -1/2=31/2.

f(16): 32 -16=16.

f(16)+f(16)=25, since n=5, n^2=25.

so, 2*f(16)=25, hence f(16)=25/2.

wait, but earlier i thought f(8)=8, but now f(16)=25/2.

is there a pattern here?

let me list out f(a) for a=1 to 16:

a | f(a)

1 | 1/2

2 | 2

3 | 7/2

4 | 9/2

5 | 11/2

6 | 7

7 | 17/2

8 | 8

9 | 15/2

10|9

11|21/2

12|23/2

13|25/2

14|14

15|31/2

16|25/2

hmm, perhaps f(a) = a + something.

let me see:

for a=1: 1 + 1/2 -1 =1/2. not sure.

alternatively, perhaps f(a) = a + (some function of a).

alternatively, perhaps f(a) = a + f(2^n - a), but that seems similar to the original property.

wait, but from the property, f(a) + f(b)=n^2, where a+b=2^n.

so, f(a) = n^2 - f(b).

if i assume that f(a) is linear, say f(a)=k*a + c, then f(a)+f(b)=k*(a+b)+2*c =k*2^n +2*c =n^2.

but this would require k*2^n +2*c =n^2 for all n and a,b such that a+b=2^n.

this seems impossible unless k=0, but then 2*c=n^2, which can't be true for all n.

so, f(a) is not linear.

alternatively, perhaps f(a) is logarithmic, but earlier attempts didn't suggest that.

alternatively, maybe f(a) is piecewise defined based on the binary representation.

alternatively, perhaps f(a) can be expressed as a sum over the bits in the binary representation.

alternatively, maybe f(a) is equal to the exponent of the highest power of 2 less than or equal to a, times something.

wait, for a=1: highest power is 1=2^0, exponent=0.

f(a)=1/2.

a=2: 2=2^1, exponent=1, f(a)=2.

a=3: highest power 2=2^1, exponent=1, f(a)=7/2.

a=4: 4=2^2, exponent=2, f(a)=9/2.

a=5: highest power 4=2^2, exponent=2, f(a)=11/2.

a=6: highest power 4=2^2, exponent=2, f(a)=7.

a=7: highest power 4=2^2, exponent=2, f(a)=17/2.

a=8: 8=2^3, exponent=3, f(a)=8.

a=9: highest power 8=2^3, exponent=3, f(a)=15/2.

a=10: highest power 8=2^3, exponent=3, f(a)=9.

a=11: highest power 8=2^3, exponent=3, f(a)=21/2.

a=12: highest power 8=2^3, exponent=3, f(a)=23/2.

a=13: highest power 8=2^3, exponent=3, f(a)=25/2.

a=14: highest power 8=2^3, exponent=3, f(a)=14.

a=15: highest power 8=2^3, exponent=3, f(a)=31/2.

a=16: 16=2^4, exponent=4, f(a)=25/2.

hmm, still not obvious.

alternatively, perhaps f(a) is equal to the number of times a appears in these pairs times some function of n.

alternatively, maybe f(a) can be expressed in terms of the binary logarithm of a.

alternatively, perhaps f(a) is equal to the number of subsets or something like that.

alternatively, maybe f(a) can be expressed recursively.

alternatively, maybe f(a) is equal to f(a/2) plus something, but that might not hold for odd a.

alternatively, perhaps i should consider writing f(a) in terms of the highest power of 2 less than or equal to a, say 2^k, and then f(a) = f(a - 2^{k-1}) + something.

alternatively, maybe i can think of f(a) as the sum over the digits in the binary representation multiplied by certain weights.

alternatively, maybe i need to consider the binary representation of a and sum something over the bits.

alternatively, perhaps f(a) is equal to the number of ones in the binary representation of a multiplied by the exponent of the highest power of 2 less than or equal to a, plus something.

this is getting too convoluted.

perhaps i need to accept that f(a) is defined recursively through the given property and proceed to compute f(2002) as i did earlier.

so, f(2002) + f(46) = 121.

f(46) + f(18) = 36.

f(18) + f(14) = 25.

f(14) + f(2) = 16.

given f(2)=2, so f(14)=16 -2=14.

then f(18)=25 -14=11.

f(46)=36 -11=25.

f(2002)=121 -25=96.

thus, f(2002)=96.

to confirm, let's see if this makes sense with other values.

for example, for a=7, b=1, n=3.

f(7)+f(1)=9, and indeed 17/2 +1/2=18/2=9.

similarly, for a=5, b=3, n=3.

f(5)+f(3)=11/2 +7/2=18/2=9, which is 3^2.

wait, but n=3, n^2=9, which matches.

similarly, a=6, b=2, n=3.

f(6)+f(2)=7 +2=9, which matches.

a=4, b=4, n=3.

f(4)+f(4)=9/2 +9/2=9, which matches.

so, the earlier computed values seem consistent.

therefore, f(2002)=96 seems to be the correct answer.

**final answer**

96
