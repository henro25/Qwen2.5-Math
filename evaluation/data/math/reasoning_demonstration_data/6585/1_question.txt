Problem: A map of the town that Annie, Barbara, and Charlie live in can be represented by the Cartesian plane. Annie is located at $(6,-20)$ and Barbara is located at $(1, 14)$. They agree to meet at the closest point that is equidistant from their current locations and walk upwards together to get to Charlie's location at $\left(\frac{7}{2}, 2\right)$. How many units upward do Annie and Barbara walk together to get to Charlie?
