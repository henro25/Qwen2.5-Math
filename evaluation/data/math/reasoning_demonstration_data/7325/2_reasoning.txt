Reasoning: So i need to convert the decimal number 115 to base 11. i'm a bit rusty on base conversions, but i think i can figure this out step by step. first, i need to understand what it means to convert a number from base 10 to base 11.

in base 10, each digit represents a power of 10. for example, the number 115 in base 10 is:

1
×
1
0
2
+
1
×
1
0
1
+
5
×
1
0
0
1×10 
2
 +1×10 
1
 +5×10 
0
 
which is:

1
×
100
+
1
×
10
+
5
×
1
=
100
+
10
+
5
=
115
1×100+1×10+5×1=100+10+5=115
now, in base 11, each digit represents a power of 11. so, the rightmost digit is 
1
1
0
11 
0
 , then 
1
1
1
11 
1
 , 
1
1
2
11 
2
 , and so on. my goal is to find digits 
a
,
b
,
c
,
a,b,c, etc., such that:

a
×
1
1
2
+
b
×
1
1
1
+
c
×
1
1
0
=
115
a×11 
2
 +b×11 
1
 +c×11 
0
 =115
i need to find the values of 
a
,
b
,
c
a,b,c that satisfy this equation, where each digit is less than 11 since it's base 11. also, if any digit is 10, i should represent it as 
a
a.

to find these digits, i can use the division method, where i divide the number by the base repeatedly and keep track of the remainders.

let's start by dividing 115 by 11.

first division:

115
÷
11
=
10
 with a remainder of 
5
115÷11=10 with a remainder of 5
so, the remainder is 5, which will be the least significant digit (rightmost digit) in base 11.

now, take the quotient from the first division, which is 10, and divide that by 11.

second division:

10
÷
11
=
0
 with a remainder of 
10
10÷11=0 with a remainder of 10
the remainder is 10, which, according to the problem, should be represented as 
a
a.

since the quotient is now 0, i stop here.

so, reading the remainders from last to first, the base 11 representation should be 
a
5
a5.

wait a minute, that doesn't seem right. let me check my calculations again.

first division:

115
÷
11
=
10
 with a remainder of 
5
115÷11=10 with a remainder of 5
yes, that's correct because 
11
×
10
=
110
11×10=110, and 
115
−
110
=
5
115−110=5.

second division:

10
÷
11
=
0
 with a remainder of 
10
10÷11=0 with a remainder of 10
hmm, but 10 divided by 11 is indeed 0 with a remainder of 10.

so, putting the remainders together, starting from the last division, it should be 
a
5
a5.

but wait, i think i might be missing something. let me try another approach to verify.

another way to convert is to express 115 as a sum of powers of 11.

first, find the largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 115.

calculate 
1
1
2
=
121
11 
2
 =121, which is larger than 115, so i should use 
1
1
1
=
11
11 
1
 =11.

wait, no, that can't be right. if 
1
1
2
=
121
11 
2
 =121 is larger than 115, then the highest power i can use is 
1
1
1
=
11
11 
1
 =11.

but actually, in base 11, the place values are 
1
1
2
=
121
11 
2
 =121, 
1
1
1
=
11
11 
1
 =11, and 
1
1
0
=
1
11 
0
 =1.

since 115 is less than 121, the coefficient for 
1
1
2
11 
2
  is 0.

so, let's write:

115
=
a
×
1
1
1
+
b
×
1
1
0
115=a×11 
1
 +b×11 
0
 
115
=
a
×
11
+
b
115=a×11+b
where 
a
a and 
b
b are digits less than 11.

to find 
a
a, divide 115 by 11:

a
=
⌊
115
11
⌋
=
10
a=⌊ 
11
115
​	
 ⌋=10
and the remainder is:

b
=
115
−
11
×
10
=
115
−
110
=
5
b=115−11×10=115−110=5
so, 
a
=
10
a=10 and 
b
=
5
b=5.

since 
a
=
10
a=10 is represented as 
a
a, the base 11 number should be 
a
5
a5.

wait, but earlier i thought that might be incorrect. maybe i need to consider the position of the digits.

in base 11, the leftmost digit is the highest power, which in this case is 
1
1
1
11 
1
 , and the rightmost is 
1
1
0
11 
0
 .

so, 
a
a is in the 
1
1
1
11 
1
  place, and 5 is in the 
1
1
0
11 
0
  place.

so, the number should be written as 
a
5
11
a5 
11
​	
 .

to confirm, let's convert 
a
5
11
a5 
11
​	
  back to base 10 to see if it equals 115.

first, replace 
a
a with 10:

a
5
11
=
10
×
1
1
1
+
5
×
1
1
0
=
10
×
11
+
5
×
1
=
110
+
5
=
115
a5 
11
​	
 =10×11 
1
 +5×11 
0
 =10×11+5×1=110+5=115
yes, that checks out.

so, 
11
5
10
=
a
5
11
115 
10
​	
 =a5 
11
​	
 .

alternatively, i could have used the positional method.

starting from the right:

- the rightmost digit is 
1
1
0
=
1
11 
0
 =1, which is 5 in this case.

- the next digit to the left is 
1
1
1
=
11
11 
1
 =11, which is 
a
a (10).

so, 
a
×
11
+
5
×
1
=
110
+
5
=
115
a×11+5×1=110+5=115, which matches the original number.

therefore, the base 11 representation of 115 is indeed 
a
5
a5.

i think i'm confident with this answer now.

**final answer**

a
5
11
