Problem: Dean is playing a game with calculators. The 42 participants (including Dean) sit in a circle, and Dean holds 3 calculators. One calculator reads 1, another 0, and the last one -1. Dean starts by pressing the cube button on the calculator that shows 1, pressing the square button on the one that shows 0, and on the calculator that shows -1, he presses the negation button. After this, he passes all of the calculators to the next person in the circle. Each person presses the same buttons on the same calculators that Dean pressed and then passes them to the next person. Once the calculators have all gone around the circle and return to Dean so that everyone has had one turn, Dean adds up the numbers showing on the calculators. What is the sum he ends up with?
