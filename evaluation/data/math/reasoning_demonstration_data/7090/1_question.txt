Problem: The coefficients of the polynomial
\[a_{10} x^{10} + a_9 x^9 + a_8 x^8 + \dots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\]are all integers, and its roots $r_1,$ $r_2,$ $\dots,$ $r_{10}$ are all integers.  Furthermore, the roots of the polynomial
\[a_0 x^{10} + a_1 x^9 + a_2 x^8 + \dots + a_8 x^2 + a_9 x + a_{10} = 0\]are also $r_1,$ $r_2,$ $\dots,$ $r_{10}.$  Find the number of possible multisets $S = \{r_1, r_2, \dots, r_{10}\}.$

(A multiset, unlike a set, can contain multiple elements.  For example, $\{-2, -2, 5, 5, 5\}$ and $\{5, -2, 5, 5, -2\}$ are the same multiset, but both are different from $\{-2, 5, 5, 5\}.$  And as usual, $a_{10} \neq 0$ and $a_0 \neq 0.$)
