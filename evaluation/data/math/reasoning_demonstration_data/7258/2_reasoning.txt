Reasoning: So i've got this equation here: 
3
x
+
5
y
=
20
3x+5y=20, and i need to find the y-intercept. hmm, y-intercept... i remember that the y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. and on the y-axis, the x-coordinate is always 0. so, to find the y-intercept, i should set 
x
=
0
x=0 and solve for 
y
y.

let me try that. if 
x
=
0
x=0, then plugging into the equation:

3
(
0
)
+
5
y
=
20
3(0)+5y=20

simplifying that, 
0
+
5
y
=
20
0+5y=20, which is just 
5
y
=
20
5y=20.

now, to solve for 
y
y, i need to divide both sides by 5:

y
=
20
5
y= 
5
20
​	
 

so, 
y
=
4
y=4.

therefore, the y-intercept is at the point where 
x
=
0
x=0 and 
y
=
4
y=4, which is the ordered pair 
(
0
,
4
)
(0,4).

wait a second, is there another way to find the y-intercept? maybe using the slope-intercept form of a line, which is 
y
=
m
x
+
b
y=mx+b, where 
b
b is the y-intercept.

let me try rearranging the original equation into slope-intercept form.

starting with 
3
x
+
5
y
=
20
3x+5y=20, i can solve for 
y
y:

first, subtract 
3
x
3x from both sides:

5
y
=
−
3
x
+
20
5y=−3x+20

then, divide every term by 5:

y
=
−
3
5
x
+
4
y=− 
5
3
​	
 x+4

so, in this form, 
b
=
4
b=4, which confirms that the y-intercept is 
(
0
,
4
)
(0,4).

okay, that matches what i got earlier. it seems consistent.

just to be thorough, maybe i can graph this line and see where it crosses the y-axis.

if 
x
=
0
x=0, 
y
=
4
y=4, so that's one point: 
(
0
,
4
)
(0,4).

let me find another point to confirm the line.

suppose 
y
=
0
y=0, then:

3
x
+
5
(
0
)
=
20
3x+5(0)=20

so, 
3
x
=
20
3x=20, which means 
x
=
20
3
x= 
3
20
​	
 , approximately 6.666...

so, another point is 
(
20
3
,
0
)
( 
3
20
​	
 ,0).

plotting these two points, 
(
0
,
4
)
(0,4) and 
(
20
3
,
0
)
( 
3
20
​	
 ,0), and drawing a straight line through them should give me the graph of 
3
x
+
5
y
=
20
3x+5y=20.

looking at this graph, indeed, it crosses the y-axis at 
y
=
4
y=4, which reinforces that the y-intercept is 
(
0
,
4
)
(0,4).

i think i've covered all the bases here. i used substitution by setting 
x
=
0
x=0, converted the equation to slope-intercept form, and even considered plotting points to visualize the line. all methods point to the same y-intercept.

just to be extra sure, maybe i can plug in 
x
=
0
x=0 and 
y
=
4
y=4 back into the original equation to verify.

original equation: 
3
x
+
5
y
=
20
3x+5y=20

plugging in 
x
=
0
x=0 and 
y
=
4
y=4:

3
(
0
)
+
5
(
4
)
=
0
+
20
=
20
3(0)+5(4)=0+20=20, which matches the right side of the equation.

perfect, that checks out.

i don't think there's anything else to do here. the y-intercept is clearly 
(
0
,
4
)
(0,4).

**final answer**

(0, 4)
