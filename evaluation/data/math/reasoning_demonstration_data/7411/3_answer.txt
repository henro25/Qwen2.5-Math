Answer: To find the probability that all three Escher prints are placed consecutively when hanging 10 pieces of art in a row, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to arrange 10 pieces of art:**
   - This is simply \(10!\), as there are 10 distinct pieces.

2. **Calculate the number of favorable arrangements where the three Escher prints are together:**
   - Treat the three Escher prints as a single unit. This gives us 8 units to arrange (the group of Escher prints plus the other 7 pieces).
   - The 8 units can be arranged in \(8!\) ways.
   - Within the group, the three Escher prints can be arranged among themselves in \(3!\) ways.
   - So, the total number of favorable arrangements is \(8! \times 3!\).

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements:
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{8! \times 3!}{10!}
   \]
   - Simplifying:
   \[
   10! = 10 \times 9 \times 8! \quad \text{so} \quad \frac{8! \times 3!}{10!} = \frac{3!}{10 \times 9} = \frac{6}{90} = \frac{1}{15}
   \]

**Answer:** The probability that all three Escher prints are placed consecutively is \(\frac{1}{15}\).
