Reasoning: Okay, so I have this probability problem here. My grandpa has 10 pieces of art, and among them, there are 3 prints by Escher. He's going to hang them in a row in a random order, and I need to find the probability that all three Escher prints are placed consecutively.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. Probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to find out how many ways the Escher prints can be together and divide that by the total number of ways to arrange all 10 pieces.

Let's think about the total number of ways to arrange 10 pieces of art. Since each piece is unique, it's just 10 factorial, which is 10! So, that's 10 × 9 × 8 × ... × 1.

Now, for the favorable outcomes where the three Escher prints are together. If I consider the three Escher prints as a single unit, then effectively, I have 10 - 3 + 1 = 8 units to arrange. Wait, is that right? Let me see. If I group the three Escher prints together, they act like one big piece, so along with the other 7 pieces, that's 8 units in total.

But wait, within that group of three Escher prints, they can be arranged among themselves in different ways. So, for each arrangement of the 8 units, the three Escher prints can be arranged in 3! ways. So, the total number of favorable arrangements should be 8! multiplied by 3!.

Therefore, the probability should be the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements, which is (8! × 3!) / 10!.

Let me check if this makes sense. The total number of ways to arrange 10 distinct items is indeed 10!. When I group the three Escher prints together, treating them as one unit, there are 8 units to arrange, which is 8!. And since the three prints can be arranged among themselves in 3! ways, I multiply those together.

But is there another way to think about this? Maybe by considering the positions where the Escher prints can be placed.

For example, if I have 10 positions in a row, I need to choose 3 consecutive positions for the Escher prints. How many sets of 3 consecutive positions are there in 10 positions?

Let's see, positions 1-3, 2-4, 3-5, ..., up to 8-10. So, that's 8 possible starting positions for the group of three Escher prints.

For each of these 8 starting positions, the three Escher prints can be arranged in 3! ways, and the remaining 7 pieces can be arranged in 7! ways.

So, the number of favorable arrangements is 8 × 3! × 7!.

Wait a minute, earlier I had 8! × 3!, but now I'm getting 8 × 3! × 7!.

Are these the same? Let's see: 8! is 8 × 7!, so 8! × 3! is 8 × 7! × 3!, which matches the second expression.

So, both approaches give the same result for the number of favorable arrangements.

Therefore, the probability is (8! × 3!) / 10!.

I can simplify this fraction to make it easier to compute.

10! is 10 × 9 × 8!, so:

(8! × 3!) / (10 × 9 × 8!) ) = 3! / (10 × 9) = 6 / 90 = 1/15.

So, the probability is 1/15.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check.

Another way to think about it is to calculate the probability step by step.

First, place one Escher print anywhere. Since the arrangement is random, it doesn't matter where it is placed.

Then, place the second Escher print. For it to be adjacent to the first one, there are only 2 positions out of the remaining 9 where it can be placed (either to the left or right of the first one, assuming linear arrangement).

Then, place the third Escher print. It needs to be adjacent to the group formed by the first two. Depending on how the second was placed, there might be only one position left or two positions.

This seems more complicated, and I might be making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the first method, which seems more straightforward.

So, the probability is 1/15.
