Problem: The Boston weatherman says there is a 75 percent chance of rain for each day of the Labor Day four-day weekend. If it doesn't rain, then the weather will be sunny.  Paul and Yuri want it to be sunny one of those days for a World War III preenactment, but if it's sunny for more than one day they won't know what to do with themselves. What is the probability they get the weather they want? Give your answer as a fraction.
