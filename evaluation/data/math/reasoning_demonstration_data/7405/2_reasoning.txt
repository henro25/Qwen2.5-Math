Reasoning: So i have this problem here: let 
f
(
x
)
=
3
x
2
−
7
f(x)=3x 
2
 −7 and 
g
(
f
(
4
)
)
=
9
g(f(4))=9. i need to find 
g
(
f
(
−
4
)
)
g(f(−4)). hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

first, i need to understand what 
f
(
x
)
f(x) is. it's a quadratic function, 
f
(
x
)
=
3
x
2
−
7
f(x)=3x 
2
 −7. that means for any input 
x
x, i square it, multiply by 3, and then subtract 7.

now, 
g
(
f
(
4
)
)
=
9
g(f(4))=9. this means that when i plug 
f
(
4
)
f(4) into the function 
g
g, i get 9. but i don't know what 
g
g is, so i need to find a way to relate 
g
(
f
(
4
)
)
g(f(4)) to 
g
(
f
(
−
4
)
)
g(f(−4)).

let me first find 
f
(
4
)
f(4) and 
f
(
−
4
)
f(−4) since those are the inputs for 
g
g.

calculating 
f
(
4
)
f(4):

f
(
4
)
=
3
(
4
)
2
−
7
=
3
(
16
)
−
7
=
48
−
7
=
41
f(4)=3(4) 
2
 −7=3(16)−7=48−7=41
so, 
f
(
4
)
=
41
f(4)=41.

now, calculating 
f
(
−
4
)
f(−4):

f
(
−
4
)
=
3
(
−
4
)
2
−
7
=
3
(
16
)
−
7
=
48
−
7
=
41
f(−4)=3(−4) 
2
 −7=3(16)−7=48−7=41
interesting, 
f
(
−
4
)
f(−4) is also 41. that's because squaring -4 gives the same result as squaring 4.

so, both 
f
(
4
)
f(4) and 
f
(
−
4
)
f(−4) equal 41. that means 
g
(
f
(
4
)
)
=
g
(
41
)
=
9
g(f(4))=g(41)=9.

since 
f
(
−
4
)
=
41
f(−4)=41 as well, then 
g
(
f
(
−
4
)
)
=
g
(
41
)
g(f(−4))=g(41).

but wait, 
g
(
41
)
g(41) is already given as 9 from 
g
(
f
(
4
)
)
=
9
g(f(4))=9.

therefore, 
g
(
f
(
−
4
)
)
=
9
g(f(−4))=9.

so, the answer should be 9.

let me just double-check to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

first, compute 
f
(
4
)
f(4):

f
(
4
)
=
3
(
4
)
2
−
7
=
48
−
7
=
41
f(4)=3(4) 
2
 −7=48−7=41
correct.

then, compute 
f
(
−
4
)
f(−4):

f
(
−
4
)
=
3
(
−
4
)
2
−
7
=
48
−
7
=
41
f(−4)=3(−4) 
2
 −7=48−7=41
also correct.

given that 
g
(
f
(
4
)
)
=
g
(
41
)
=
9
g(f(4))=g(41)=9, and since 
f
(
−
4
)
=
41
f(−4)=41, it follows that 
g
(
f
(
−
4
)
)
=
g
(
41
)
=
9
g(f(−4))=g(41)=9.

i think that's solid. i don't see any errors in this reasoning.
