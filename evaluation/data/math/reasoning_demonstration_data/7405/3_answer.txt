Answer: First, we are given the function \( f(x) = 3x^2 - 7 \) and the information that \( g(f(4)) = 9 \). we need to find \( g(f(-4)) \).

we start by calculating \( f(4) \):
\[
f(4) = 3(4)^2 - 7 = 3(16) - 7 = 48 - 7 = 41
\]

next, we calculate \( f(-4) \):
\[
f(-4) = 3(-4)^2 - 7 = 3(16) - 7 = 48 - 7 = 41
\]

since both \( f(4) \) and \( f(-4) \) equal 41, we have:
\[
g(f(4)) = g(41) = 9
\]

therefore, \( g(f(-4)) = g(41) = 9 \).

the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]
