Problem: 100 people who were surveyed and asked the question: ``Is fuchsia kinda pink, or purply?'' Of them, 60 believe that fuchsia is ``kinda pink'' and 27 believe it is both ``kinda pink,'' and also ``purply.''  Another 17 think that fuchsia is neither ``kinda pink'' nor ``purply.''

How many of those 100 people believe that fuchsia is ``purply''?
