Reasoning: 
So i have this probability problem here: "two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards. what is the probability that the first card is a king and the second card is a heart?" alright, let's see how to tackle this.

first, i need to understand what's being asked. we have a standard deck of 52 cards, and we're dealing two cards in sequence. the first card needs to be a king, and the second card needs to be a heart. i need to find the probability of both these events happening in this specific order.

probability is generally about the chance of an event occurring, and when dealing with multiple events, especially dependent ones, i need to consider how one event affects the other.

so, for the first part, the probability that the first card is a king. there are 4 kings in a standard deck of 52 cards. so, the probability of drawing a king first is 4 out of 52, or 4/52.

now, given that the first card is a king, i need to find the probability that the second card is a heart. but here's where it gets a bit tricky because the first card could be a king of hearts or one of the other kings.

if the first card is the king of hearts, then there are now 12 hearts left in the deck (since one heart, the king of hearts, has already been removed). but if the first card is one of the other three kings (king of spades, diamonds, or clubs), then there are still 13 hearts remaining in the deck.

so, it seems like i need to consider these two separate cases and then combine them appropriately.

let me try to structure this.

first, calculate the probability that the first card is the king of hearts, and then the second card is a heart.

second, calculate the probability that the first card is a king that is not a heart, and then the second card is a heart.

then, add these two probabilities together to get the total probability of the desired outcome.

alright, let's start with the first case:

case 1: first card is the king of hearts.

the probability of drawing the king of hearts first is 1 out of 52, since there's only one king of hearts in the deck.

then, after drawing the king of hearts, there are 51 cards left in the deck, and 12 hearts remaining (since we've already taken out one heart).

so, the probability of drawing a heart in the second draw, given that the first card was the king of hearts, is 12 out of 51.

therefore, the probability for this case is (1/52) * (12/51).

now, case 2: first card is a king that is not a heart.

there are three kings that are not hearts: king of spades, king of diamonds, and king of clubs.

so, the probability of drawing one of these three kings first is 3 out of 52.

then, after drawing one of these kings, there are still 13 hearts left in the remaining 51 cards.

so, the probability of drawing a heart in the second draw, given that the first card was a king that is not a heart, is 13 out of 51.

therefore, the probability for this case is (3/52) * (13/51).

now, to find the total probability of the first card being a king and the second card being a heart, i need to add the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive cases.

so, total probability = (1/52)*(12/51) + (3/52)*(13/51).

let me calculate that.

first, calculate (1/52)*(12/51):

1 * 12 = 12

52 * 51 = 2652

so, 12/2652

similarly, (3/52)*(13/51):

3 * 13 = 39

52 * 51 = 2652

so, 39/2652

now, total probability = 12/2652 + 39/2652 = (12 + 39)/2652 = 51/2652

simplify 51/2652.

let's divide numerator and denominator by 3:

51 ÷ 3 = 17

2652 ÷ 3 = 884

so, 17/884

can this be simplified further? let's see.

17 is a prime number, and 884 divided by 17 is 52.

wait, 17*52 = 884, yes.

so, 17 and 52 have no common factors besides 1, so 17/884 is the simplified form.

alternatively, maybe i can find a better way to simplify 51/2652.

let me try dividing numerator and denominator by 13:

51 ÷ 13 = 3.923, which is not an integer.

wait, 51 ÷ 13 is not an integer; 13*3=39, 13*4=52, so no.

wait, perhaps i made a mistake earlier.

let me check 51/2652.

divide numerator and denominator by 51:

51 ÷ 51 = 1

2652 ÷ 51 = 52

so, 1/52.

wait, but earlier i thought it was 17/884.

but 17/884 simplifies to 1/52, since 17*52=884.

yes, because 17*52=884, and 52*51=2652.

wait, i'm getting a bit confused here.

let me double-check.

original total probability: 51/2652

divide numerator and denominator by 51:

51 ÷ 51 = 1

2652 ÷ 51 = 52

so, 1/52.

alternatively, 51/2652 = (51 ÷ 51)/(2652 ÷ 51) = 1/52.

yes, that's simpler.

so, the probability is 1/52.

wait a minute, that seems too simple. is that correct?

let me verify.

alternatively, i can think about it in another way.

the total number of ways to draw two cards from a deck is 52*51, since it's without replacement and order matters.

the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to first draw a king and then a heart.

as before, there are two cases:

1. first card is king of hearts, then any of the remaining 12 hearts.

number of ways: 1 (king of hearts) * 12 (remaining hearts) = 12

2. first card is one of the other three kings, then any of the 13 hearts.

number of ways: 3 (other kings) * 13 (hearts) = 39

total favorable outcomes: 12 + 39 = 51

total possible outcomes: 52 * 51 = 2652

so, probability = 51 / 2652 = 1/52

yes, that matches.

alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way to think about it.

is there a way to calculate this probability without splitting into cases?

let me think.

we need p(first card is king and second card is heart).

we can use the multiplication rule for dependent events:

p(a and b) = p(a) * p(b | a)

here, a is first card is king, b is second card is heart.

so, p(a) = p(first card is king) = 4/52

p(b | a) = p(second card is heart given first card is king)

now, depending on whether the first king was a heart or not, p(b | a) changes.

wait, that's basically the same as splitting into cases.

alternatively, maybe i can think of it as:

p(first card is king and second is heart) = p(first card is king of hearts) * p(second card is heart | first is king of hearts) + p(first card is king but not heart) * p(second card is heart | first is king but not heart)

which is exactly what i did earlier.

so, perhaps 1/52 is the correct answer.

but let me see if there's another approach.

suppose i don't consider the order, but in this problem, order matters because it's first card and then second card.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the probability that the first card is a king, and the second card is a heart, without worrying about whether the king is a heart or not, but i think that's what i did already.

alternatively, think about it this way: the probability that the first card is a king is 4/52.

then, the probability that the second card is a heart, given that the first card was a king.

but the first card could be a king of hearts or not.

so, perhaps it's better to stick with the original approach.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that the second card being a heart is independent of the first card being a king, but i don't think that's the case because if the first card is the king of hearts, it affects the number of hearts remaining.

alternatively, maybe i can think in terms of conditional probability.

wait, perhaps i can use the law of total probability.

p(second is heart | first is king) = p(second is heart | first is king of hearts) * p(first is king of hearts | first is king) + p(second is heart | first is king not heart) * p(first is king not heart | first is king)

so, p(second is heart | first is king) = (12/51)*(1/4) + (13/51)*(3/4) = (12/51)*(1/4) + (13/51)*(3/4)

wait, p(first is king of hearts | first is king) is 1/4, since there are four kings, one of which is hearts.

similarly, p(first is king not heart | first is king) is 3/4.

so, p(second is heart | first is king) = (12/51)*(1/4) + (13/51)*(3/4)

let's calculate that.

first term: (12/51)*(1/4) = 12/204

second term: (13/51)*(3/4) = 39/204

total: 12/204 + 39/204 = 51/204 = 17/68 = 1/4

wait, that seems different from earlier.

wait, no, i think i messed up.

wait, p(second is heart | first is king) = (12/51)*(1/4) + (13/51)*(3/4) = (12 + 39)/204 = 51/204 = 17/68 = 1/4

but earlier, i had p(first is king and second is heart) = p(first is king) * p(second is heart | first is king) = (4/52) * (1/4) = 1/52

wait, but this gives the same result as before.

wait, p(first is king and second is heart) = p(first is king) * p(second is heart | first is king) = (4/52) * (1/4) = 1/52

wait, but according to the earlier calculation, p(second is heart | first is king) is 1/4.

but in my first approach, i calculated it as 51/2652 = 1/52.

now, in this approach, i get (4/52)*(1/4)=1/52.

so, both approaches give the same result.

alternatively, perhaps i can think about it differently.

let me think about symmetry.

in a standard deck, there are 52 cards, and we're drawing two in sequence.

the probability that the first card is a king is 4/52.

the probability that the second card is a heart, given the first was a king, depends on whether that king was a heart or not.

but perhaps another way to think is to consider that the total number of possible ordered pairs is 52*51.

the number of favorable ordered pairs is the number of kings times the number of hearts, adjusted for overlap.

wait, but i think i already considered that.

alternatively, perhaps consider that the probability that the second card is a heart is 13/51, given that the first card was a king.

wait, no, because it depends on whether the first king was a heart or not.

alternatively, perhaps i can think about it as:

there are 52 choices for the first card, and for each, 51 choices for the second card.

favorable outcomes: first card is a king (4 choices), and second card is a heart.

but again, it depends on whether the first king was a heart or not.

wait, perhaps there's a formula for such joint probabilities.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the fact that in a standard deck, the probability that the second card is a heart is independent of the first card being a king, but i don't think that's true.

wait, no, because if the first card is a heart king, then there are fewer hearts left.

alternatively, perhaps i can think in terms of combinations.

wait, but order matters here, so combinations might not be the best approach.

alternatively, perhaps i can think in terms of permutations.

total number of ways to draw two cards in order: 52p2 = 52*51 = 2652

number of favorable outcomes: number of ways to first draw a king and then a heart.

as earlier, 1*12 + 3*13 = 12 + 39 = 51

so, probability is 51/2652 = 1/52

yes, that seems consistent.

alternatively, perhaps i can think of it as:

p(first is king and second is heart) = p(first is king of hearts) * p(second is heart | first is king of hearts) + p(first is king not heart) * p(second is heart | first is king not heart)

which is exactly what i did earlier.

so, i think the answer is 1/52.

but wait, i'm a bit confused because in the first approach, i got 1/52, but in another approach, i thought of p(second is heart | first is king) = 1/4, and then p(first is king) = 4/52, and their product is 1/52.

alternatively, perhaps i can think about it in terms of expectation.

wait, maybe that's overcomplicating.

alternatively, perhaps consider that there are 4 kings and 13 hearts.

but no, because the king of hearts is both a king and a heart, so there is overlap.

alternatively, perhaps consider that the probability that the first card is a king is 4/52.

then, the probability that the second card is a heart is, if the first card was a king of hearts, 12/51; if the first card was a king not hearts, 13/51.

so, overall, it's (1/52)*(12/51) + (3/52)*(13/51) = 12/2652 + 39/2652 = 51/2652 = 1/52.

yes, consistent again.

alternatively, perhaps think about it as:

the probability that the first card is a king is 4/52.

the probability that the second card is a heart, given the first is a king, is:

if the first king is a heart, then 12/51

if not, then 13/51

so, overall, p(second is heart | first is king) = p(first is king of hearts | first is king) * 12/51 + p(first is king not heart | first is king) * 13/51

= (1/4)*(12/51) + (3/4)*(13/51)

= 12/204 + 39/204

= 51/204

= 1/4

wait, but then p(first is king and second is heart) = p(first is king) * p(second is heart | first is king) = (4/52)*(1/4) = 1/52

again, same answer.

wait, but now i'm getting 1/4 for p(second is heart | first is king), but earlier i thought it should be less.

wait, maybe i need to double-check this.

wait, p(second is heart | first is king) = (12/51)*(1/4) + (13/51)*(3/4) = (12 + 39)/204 = 51/204 = 1/4

but earlier, total probability is p(first is king) * p(second is heart | first is king) = (4/52)*(1/4) = 1/52

alternatively, perhaps i can think of it as:

the probability that the second card is a heart, given that the first card is a king, is the same as the probability that the second card is a heart, without any condition, because the first card being a king doesn't affect the second card being a heart, except if the first card was the king of hearts.

wait, but that doesn't seem right.

wait, actually, the second card being a heart is affected by whether the first card was a heart or not.

wait, more precisely, it's affected if the first card was the king of hearts, because that removes one heart from the deck.

if the first card was a king that's not a heart, then there are still 13 hearts left.

so, in general, p(second is heart | first is king) = [p(first is king of hearts) * p(second is heart | first is king of hearts)] + [p(first is king not heart) * p(second is heart | first is king not heart)]

= (1/52) * (12/51) + (3/52) * (13/51)

wait, no, actually, p(first is king of hearts | first is king) = 1/4, not 1/52.

wait, no, in the conditional probability, given that the first card is a king, the probability that it's the king of hearts is 1/4, since there are four kings.

so, p(second is heart | first is king) = (1/4)*(12/51) + (3/4)*(13/51) = (12 + 39)/204 = 51/204 = 1/4

so, p(first is king and second is heart) = p(first is king) * p(second is heart | first is king) = (4/52)*(1/4) = 1/52

yes, consistent.

alternatively, perhaps i can think about the fact that the first card being a king reduces the deck size to 51, and the number of hearts left depends on whether the first king was a heart or not.

but regardless of that, all these approaches are leading me to the same answer: 1/52.

so, perhaps that is indeed the correct answer.

alternatively, perhaps i can simulate it.

suppose i have a deck of 52 cards.

number of ways to choose first card as a king: 4 choices.

then, second card as a heart: depends on first card.

if first card is king of hearts: 12 hearts left.

if first card is king not heart: 13 hearts left.

total favorable: 1*12 + 3*13 = 12 + 39 = 51

total possible: 52*51 = 2652

probability: 51/2652 = 1/52

yes, consistent again.

alternatively, perhaps i can think in terms of fractions.

the probability that the first card is a king is 4/52.

then, the probability that the second card is a heart, given that the first was a king, is:

if the first was king of hearts: 12/51

if the first was king not heart: 13/51

so, overall, p(second is heart | first is king) = (1/4)*(12/51) + (3/4)*(13/51) = (12 + 39)/204 = 51/204 = 1/4

then, p(first is king and second is heart) = p(first is king) * p(second is heart | first is king) = (4/52)*(1/4) = 1/52

again, same answer.

wait, perhaps i can think about it in terms of expectations.

alternatively, perhaps consider that the first card being a king and the second being a heart are independent events, but they are not because the first card being a king could be a heart, affecting the second probability.

alternatively, perhaps think about the probability that the second card is a heart is 13/51, regardless of the first card, but that's not the case because if the first card was a heart, it affects the second probability.

wait, no, in this problem, the first card is specifically a king, which could be a heart or not.

alternatively, perhaps i can think about the overall probability that the second card is a heart, given that the first card is a king, which we've already determined is 1/4.

wait, but 1/4 seems a bit high for p(second is heart | first is king).

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that there are 51 cards left, and 13 hearts if the first king wasn't a heart, or 12 if it was.

but in expectation, since there's a 1/4 chance that the first king was a heart, the expected number of hearts left is 13 - 1*(1/4) = 13 - 0.25 = 12.75.

so, the probability is 12.75/51 = (51/4)/51 = 1/4.

yes, consistent again.

so, p(first is king and second is heart) = p(first is king) * p(second is heart | first is king) = (4/52)*(1/4) = 1/52.

therefore, the probability is 1/52.

alternatively, perhaps i can think about it in terms of conditional probability.

wait, perhaps that's overkill.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the fact that the probability that the second card is a heart is independent of the first card being a king, but that doesn't seem right.

wait, but in reality, the second card being a heart depends on whether the first card was a heart or not.

so, no, they're not independent.

alternatively, perhaps i can think about the fact that in a well-shuffled deck, the probability that any specific card is a heart is 13/52 = 1/4.

but again, since we're dealing with two specific positions, it's not directly applicable.

alternatively, perhaps i can think about the probability that the second card is a heart, given that the first card is a king, which is what we've been calculating.

so, in conclusion, after multiple approaches and verifications, the probability is 1/52.

therefore, the final answer is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{52}}
