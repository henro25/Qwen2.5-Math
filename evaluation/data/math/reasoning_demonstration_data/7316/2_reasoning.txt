Reasoning: So i have this problem here. juan takes a number, adds 2 to it, multiplies the answer by 2, subtracts 2 from the result, and finally divides that number by 2. his answer is 7. i need to find the original number.

hmm, let's see. i think the best way to approach this is to work backwards or maybe set up an equation based on the operations juan performed.

let me try to set up an equation. let's call the original number x.

first, juan adds 2 to it: x + 2.

then, he multiplies the answer by 2: 2*(x + 2).

next, he subtracts 2 from the result: 2*(x + 2) - 2.

finally, he divides that number by 2: [2*(x + 2) - 2]/2.

and this equals 7.

so, the equation is:

[2*(x + 2) - 2]/2 = 7.

alright, now i need to solve for x.

first, i can simplify the left side.

let's look at the numerator: 2*(x + 2) - 2.

let me distribute the 2: 2*x + 2*2 = 2x + 4.

then subtract 2: 2x + 4 - 2 = 2x + 2.

so now the equation is:

(2x + 2)/2 = 7.

i can simplify (2x + 2)/2 by dividing each term by 2:

(2x)/2 + 2/2 = x + 1.

so, x + 1 = 7.

now, solving for x:

x + 1 = 7.

subtract 1 from both sides:

x = 7 - 1.

x = 6.

wait, is that it? it seems straightforward. but let me check if this is correct by plugging it back into the original operations.

original number: 6.

add 2: 6 + 2 = 8.

multiply by 2: 8 * 2 = 16.

subtract 2: 16 - 2 = 14.

divide by 2: 14 / 2 = 7.

yes, that matches the given answer of 7. so, the original number is indeed 6.

alternatively, i could have approached this problem by working backwards from the final answer.

starting from the final step: after dividing by 2, the result is 7.

so, before dividing by 2, the number must have been 7 * 2 = 14.

before subtracting 2, the number was 14 + 2 = 16.

before multiplying by 2, the number was 16 / 2 = 8.

before adding 2, the original number was 8 - 2 = 6.

again, i arrive at the same answer, x = 6.

this confirms that the original number is 6.

i think that's sufficient. but just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other possible solutions or if there's anything i might have missed.

the operations are all linear, so there should be only one solution. addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division by a constant don't introduce any extraneous solutions or multiple possibilities.

therefore, the original number is definitely 6.

**final answer**

the original number is \boxed{6}.
