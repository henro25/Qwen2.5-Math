Answer: To find the number of triples \((x, y, z)\) of real numbers that satisfy the given equations:

\[
\begin{align*}
x &= 2018 - 2019 \operatorname{sign}(y + z), \\
y &= 2018 - 2019 \operatorname{sign}(x + z), \\
z &= 2018 - 2019 \operatorname{sign}(x + y),
\end{align*}
\]

we first consider the possible values of \(\operatorname{sign}(y + z)\), \(\operatorname{sign}(x + z)\), and \(\operatorname{sign}(x + y)\), which can be -1, 0, or 1. however, through analysis, we find that \(y + z\), \(x + z\), and \(x + y\) cannot be zero, so \(\operatorname{sign}(y + z)\), \(\operatorname{sign}(x + z)\), and \(\operatorname{sign}(x + y)\) can only be -1 or 1.

we denote:

\[
a = \operatorname{sign}(y + z), \quad b = \operatorname{sign}(x + z), \quad c = \operatorname{sign}(x + y)
\]

and find that:

\[
x = 2018 - 2019a, \quad y = 2018 - 2019b, \quad z = 2018 - 2019c
\]

we then check the consistency of the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) by considering the possible combinations of -1 and 1 for these variables. we find that the valid combinations are:

1. \(a = 1\), \(b = 1\), \(c = -1\)
2. \(a = 1\), \(b = -1\), \(c = 1\)
3. \(a = -1\), \(b = 1\), \(c = 1\)

each combination corresponds to a unique triple \((x, y, z)\):

1. \((x, y, z) = (-1, -1, 4037)\)
2. \((x, y, z) = (-1, 4037, -1)\)
3. \((x, y, z) = (4037, -1, -1)\)

thus, the number of such triples is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]
