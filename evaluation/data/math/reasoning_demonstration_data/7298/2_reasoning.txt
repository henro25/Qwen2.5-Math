Reasoning: So i've got this problem here, and i need to find the number of triples 
(
x
,
y
,
z
)
(x,y,z) that satisfy these three equations:

x
=
2018
−
2019
⋅
sign
⁡
(
y
+
z
)
,
y
=
2018
−
2019
⋅
sign
⁡
(
x
+
z
)
,
z
=
2018
−
2019
⋅
sign
⁡
(
x
+
y
)
.
 
x
y
z
​	
  
=2018−2019⋅sign(y+z),
=2018−2019⋅sign(x+z),
=2018−2019⋅sign(x+y).
​	
 
and the sign function is defined as:

sign
⁡
(
a
)
=
{
1
if 
a
>
0
,
0
if 
a
=
0
,
−
1
if 
a
<
0.
 
sign(a)= 
⎩
⎨
⎧
​	
  
1
0
−1
​	
  
if a>0,
if a=0,
if a<0.
​	
 
okay, first things first, i need to understand what the sign function is doing here. it takes the sum of two variables and outputs -1, 0, or 1 based on whether that sum is negative, zero, or positive.

so, for each equation, the value of one variable depends on the sign of the sum of the other two variables.

i think a good starting point is to consider the possible values of 
sign
⁡
(
y
+
z
)
sign(y+z), 
sign
⁡
(
x
+
z
)
sign(x+z), and 
sign
⁡
(
x
+
y
)
sign(x+y). since each sign function can be -1, 0, or 1, there are potentially 
3
3
=
27
3 
3
 =27 combinations to consider. but that seems like a lot, and maybe there are symmetries or constraints that can reduce the number of cases i need to check.

wait a minute, actually, i need to be careful. the sign function outputs -1, 0, or 1, but let's see what possible values 
x
x, 
y
y, and 
z
z can take based on these.

given 
x
=
2018
−
2019
⋅
sign
⁡
(
y
+
z
)
x=2018−2019⋅sign(y+z), and since 
sign
⁡
(
y
+
z
)
sign(y+z) is either -1, 0, or 1, plugging these in:

- if 
sign
⁡
(
y
+
z
)
=
−
1
sign(y+z)=−1, then 
x
=
2018
−
2019
⋅
(
−
1
)
=
2018
+
2019
=
4037
x=2018−2019⋅(−1)=2018+2019=4037.

- if 
sign
⁡
(
y
+
z
)
=
0
sign(y+z)=0, then 
x
=
2018
−
2019
⋅
0
=
2018
x=2018−2019⋅0=2018.

- if 
sign
⁡
(
y
+
z
)
=
1
sign(y+z)=1, then 
x
=
2018
−
2019
⋅
1
=
2018
−
2019
=
−
1
x=2018−2019⋅1=2018−2019=−1.

similarly, for 
y
y and 
z
z, they can each be either 4037, 2018, or -1, depending on the sign of the sum of the other two variables.

so, 
x
x, 
y
y, and 
z
z can each independently be one of these three values, but their values are interdependent based on the sums of the other two.

this seems a bit circular. maybe i can look for consistency in these equations.

let me consider possible cases based on the values of 
x
x, 
y
y, and 
z
z. since each can be 4037, 2018, or -1, there are 27 possible combinations in total. but many of these might not satisfy all three equations simultaneously.

maybe i can look for symmetry or find relations between 
x
x, 
y
y, and 
z
z.

let me try to express 
y
+
z
y+z, 
x
+
z
x+z, and 
x
+
y
x+y in terms of 
x
x, 
y
y, and 
z
z.

wait, but the sign functions are based on these sums, and 
x
x, 
y
y, and 
z
z are defined in terms of these sign functions.

alternatively, perhaps i can express 
y
+
z
y+z, 
x
+
z
x+z, and 
x
+
y
x+y in terms of 
x
x, 
y
y, and 
z
z, and then see what that implies.

let me try to solve for 
y
+
z
y+z, 
x
+
z
x+z, and 
x
+
y
x+y:

from the first equation:

x
=
2018
−
2019
⋅
sign
⁡
(
y
+
z
)
x=2018−2019⋅sign(y+z)
so,

sign
⁡
(
y
+
z
)
=
2018
−
x
2019
sign(y+z)= 
2019
2018−x
​	
 
similarly,

sign
⁡
(
x
+
z
)
=
2018
−
y
2019
,
sign
⁡
(
x
+
y
)
=
2018
−
z
2019
sign(x+z)= 
2019
2018−y
​	
 ,
sign(x+y)= 
2019
2018−z
​	
 
but 
sign
⁡
(
a
)
sign(a) can only be -1, 0, or 1, so 
2018
−
x
2019
2019
2018−x
​	
  must be one of these values. that means:

2018
−
x
2019
∈
{
−
1
,
0
,
1
}
2019
2018−x
​	
 ∈{−1,0,1}
similarly for the other two.

so, solving for 
x
x:

2018
−
x
=
2019
⋅
sign
⁡
(
y
+
z
)
2018−x=2019⋅sign(y+z)
therefore,

x
=
2018
−
2019
⋅
sign
⁡
(
y
+
z
)
x=2018−2019⋅sign(y+z)
which is just the original equation.

hmm, this seems to be going in circles.

maybe instead of trying to solve for 
x
x, 
y
y, and 
z
z directly, i can consider the possible values of 
sign
⁡
(
y
+
z
)
sign(y+z), 
sign
⁡
(
x
+
z
)
sign(x+z), and 
sign
⁡
(
x
+
y
)
sign(x+y), and see what constraints they impose on each other.

let me denote:

a
=
sign
⁡
(
y
+
z
)
,
b
=
sign
⁡
(
x
+
z
)
,
c
=
sign
⁡
(
x
+
y
)
a=sign(y+z),
b=sign(x+z),
c=sign(x+y)
then, the equations become:

x
=
2018
−
2019
a
,
y
=
2018
−
2019
b
,
z
=
2018
−
2019
c
x=2018−2019a,
y=2018−2019b,
z=2018−2019c
now, i can express 
y
+
z
y+z, 
x
+
z
x+z, and 
x
+
y
x+y in terms of 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c:

y
+
z
=
(
2018
−
2019
b
)
+
(
2018
−
2019
c
)
=
4036
−
2019
(
b
+
c
)
y+z=(2018−2019b)+(2018−2019c)=4036−2019(b+c)
similarly,

x
+
z
=
(
2018
−
2019
a
)
+
(
2018
−
2019
c
)
=
4036
−
2019
(
a
+
c
)
,
x
+
y
=
(
2018
−
2019
a
)
+
(
2018
−
2019
b
)
=
4036
−
2019
(
a
+
b
)
x+z=(2018−2019a)+(2018−2019c)=4036−2019(a+c),
x+y=(2018−2019a)+(2018−2019b)=4036−2019(a+b)
now, since 
a
=
sign
⁡
(
y
+
z
)
a=sign(y+z), and 
y
+
z
=
4036
−
2019
(
b
+
c
)
y+z=4036−2019(b+c), we have:

a
=
sign
⁡
(
4036
−
2019
(
b
+
c
)
)
a=sign(4036−2019(b+c))
similarly,

b
=
sign
⁡
(
4036
−
2019
(
a
+
c
)
)
,
c
=
sign
⁡
(
4036
−
2019
(
a
+
b
)
)
b=sign(4036−2019(a+c)),
c=sign(4036−2019(a+b))
this seems complicated, but maybe i can look for patterns or constraints.

first, note that 
4036
=
2
×
2018
4036=2×2018, and 
2019
2019 is close to 
2018
2018, but not sure if that helps.

alternatively, maybe i can think about the possible values of 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c.

each of 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c can be -1, 0, or 1.

so, there are 27 possible combinations for 
(
a
,
b
,
c
)
(a,b,c).

but not all combinations will satisfy the above equations.

so, perhaps i can iterate through all possible combinations of 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c, and see which ones satisfy:

a
=
sign
⁡
(
4036
−
2019
(
b
+
c
)
)
,
b
=
sign
⁡
(
4036
−
2019
(
a
+
c
)
)
,
c
=
sign
⁡
(
4036
−
2019
(
a
+
b
)
)
a=sign(4036−2019(b+c)),
b=sign(4036−2019(a+c)),
c=sign(4036−2019(a+b))
this seems tedious, but maybe manageable.

let me try to find some patterns or simplifications.

first, notice that 
4036
−
2019
(
b
+
c
)
4036−2019(b+c) is the argument for the sign function to determine 
a
a.

similarly for the others.

so, for each combination of 
b
b and 
c
c, i can compute 
4036
−
2019
(
b
+
c
)
4036−2019(b+c), find its sign, and see if it matches 
a
a, and similarly for the other equations.

but this still seems time-consuming.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that 
4036
4036 is much larger than 
2019
2019 times the sum of 
b
b and 
c
c, since 
b
b and 
c
c are -1, 0, or 1.

let me compute 
2019
(
b
+
c
)
2019(b+c) for possible values of 
b
b and 
c
c:

- if 
b
=
−
1
b=−1 and 
c
=
−
1
c=−1, then 
2019
(
−
1
+
−
1
)
=
−
4038
2019(−1+−1)=−4038

- if 
b
=
−
1
b=−1 and 
c
=
0
c=0, then 
2019
(
−
1
+
0
)
=
−
2019
2019(−1+0)=−2019

- if 
b
=
−
1
b=−1 and 
c
=
1
c=1, then 
2019
(
−
1
+
1
)
=
0
2019(−1+1)=0

- if 
b
=
0
b=0 and 
c
=
−
1
c=−1, then 
2019
(
0
+
−
1
)
=
−
2019
2019(0+−1)=−2019

- if 
b
=
0
b=0 and 
c
=
0
c=0, then 
2019
(
0
+
0
)
=
0
2019(0+0)=0

- if 
b
=
0
b=0 and 
c
=
1
c=1, then 
2019
(
0
+
1
)
=
2019
2019(0+1)=2019

- if 
b
=
1
b=1 and 
c
=
−
1
c=−1, then 
2019
(
1
+
−
1
)
=
0
2019(1+−1)=0

- if 
b
=
1
b=1 and 
c
=
0
c=0, then 
2019
(
1
+
0
)
=
2019
2019(1+0)=2019

- if 
b
=
1
b=1 and 
c
=
1
c=1, then 
2019
(
1
+
1
)
=
4038
2019(1+1)=4038

now, 
4036
−
2019
(
b
+
c
)
4036−2019(b+c) for each of these:

- 
4036
−
(
−
4038
)
=
4036
+
4038
=
8074
4036−(−4038)=4036+4038=8074

- 
4036
−
(
−
2019
)
=
4036
+
2019
=
6055
4036−(−2019)=4036+2019=6055

- 
4036
−
0
=
4036
4036−0=4036

- 
4036
−
(
−
2019
)
=
4036
+
2019
=
6055
4036−(−2019)=4036+2019=6055

- 
4036
−
0
=
4036
4036−0=4036

- 
4036
−
2019
=
2017
4036−2019=2017

- 
4036
−
0
=
4036
4036−0=4036

- 
4036
−
2019
=
2017
4036−2019=2017

- 
4036
−
4038
=
−
2
4036−4038=−2

now, the sign of these:

- 
8074
8074 is positive, so sign is 1

- 
6055
6055 is positive, so sign is 1

- 
4036
4036 is positive, so sign is 1

- 
6055
6055 is positive, so sign is 1

- 
4036
4036 is positive, so sign is 1

- 
2017
2017 is positive, so sign is 1

- 
4036
4036 is positive, so sign is 1

- 
2017
2017 is positive, so sign is 1

- 
−
2
−2 is negative, so sign is -1

wait a minute, in all these cases, except when 
b
=
1
b=1 and 
c
=
1
c=1, 
4036
−
2019
(
b
+
c
)
4036−2019(b+c) is positive, so 
sign
⁡
(
4036
−
2019
(
b
+
c
)
)
=
1
sign(4036−2019(b+c))=1 except when 
b
=
c
=
1
b=c=1, where it is -1.

similarly, the same logic applies for 
a
a and 
c
c and the other equations.

so, for 
a
=
sign
⁡
(
4036
−
2019
(
b
+
c
)
)
a=sign(4036−2019(b+c)), it's 1 unless 
b
=
c
=
1
b=c=1, in which case it's -1.

similarly,

b
=
sign
⁡
(
4036
−
2019
(
a
+
c
)
)
b=sign(4036−2019(a+c)), which is 1 unless 
a
=
c
=
1
a=c=1, then it's -1.

c
=
sign
⁡
(
4036
−
2019
(
a
+
b
)
)
c=sign(4036−2019(a+b)), which is 1 unless 
a
=
b
=
1
a=b=1, then it's -1.

so, now we have:

a
=
{
1
if 
b
+
c
≠
2
,
−
1
if 
b
+
c
=
2.
 
a={ 
1
−1
​	
  
if b+c

=2,
if b+c=2.
​	
 
similarly,

b
=
{
1
if 
a
+
c
≠
2
,
−
1
if 
a
+
c
=
2.
 
,
c
=
{
1
if 
a
+
b
≠
2
,
−
1
if 
a
+
b
=
2.
 
b={ 
1
−1
​	
  
if a+c

=2,
if a+c=2.
​	
 ,
c={ 
1
−1
​	
  
if a+b

=2,
if a+b=2.
​	
 
now, since 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c can be -1, 0, or 1, but based on the above, it seems they can only be 1 or -1, because in all cases, except when 
b
+
c
=
2
b+c=2, 
a
a is 1, and similarly for 
b
b and 
c
c.

wait, but in the earlier calculations, when 
b
=
1
b=1 and 
c
=
1
c=1, 
a
=
−
1
a=−1, but in all other cases, 
a
=
1
a=1.

similarly for 
b
b and 
c
c.

so, it seems 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c can only be 1 or -1, not 0.

is that possible? because earlier, i considered that 
sign
⁡
(
y
+
z
)
sign(y+z) could be -1, 0, or 1, but in the calculations above, with the specific numbers, it seems that 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c are only 1 or -1.

wait, maybe the sum 
y
+
z
y+z cannot be zero, given these equations.

let me check.

if 
y
+
z
=
0
y+z=0, then 
sign
⁡
(
y
+
z
)
=
0
sign(y+z)=0, which would make 
x
=
2018
−
2019
⋅
0
=
2018
x=2018−2019⋅0=2018.

similarly, if 
x
+
z
=
0
x+z=0, then 
y
=
2018
y=2018, and if 
x
+
y
=
0
x+y=0, then 
z
=
2018
z=2018.

but if i plug in 
x
=
2018
x=2018, 
y
=
2018
y=2018, and 
z
=
2018
z=2018, let's see what happens.

compute 
y
+
z
=
2018
+
2018
=
4036
y+z=2018+2018=4036, which is positive, so 
sign
⁡
(
y
+
z
)
=
1
sign(y+z)=1, but according to the first equation, 
x
=
2018
−
2019
⋅
1
=
−
1
x=2018−2019⋅1=−1, which contradicts 
x
=
2018
x=2018.

so, it's impossible for 
y
+
z
y+z to be zero if 
x
=
2018
x=2018, because that would lead to a contradiction.

therefore, 
y
+
z
y+z cannot be zero in this system.

similarly, if 
x
+
z
=
0
x+z=0, then 
y
=
2018
y=2018, but then 
x
+
z
=
0
x+z=0 implies 
x
=
−
z
x=−z, and plugging into the other equations would lead to inconsistencies.

so, it seems that 
y
+
z
y+z, 
x
+
z
x+z, and 
x
+
y
x+y cannot be zero in any solution.

therefore, 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c can only be 1 or -1, not 0.

that simplifies things a bit.

so, now i only need to consider 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c being either 1 or -1.

that reduces the number of cases from 27 to 
2

=

 =8.

let me list all possible combinations of 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c:

1. 
a
=
1
a=1, 
b
=

b=1, 
c
=

c=1

2. 
a

a=1, 
b

c=−1

3.

8. 
a
=
−
1
a=−1, 
b
=
−
1
b=−1, 
c
=
−

c=−1

now, for each of these, i need to check if they satisfy the conditions:

a
=
{

b

−

if

now, for each of these valid 
(
a
,
b
,
c
)
(a,b,c) combinations, i need to find the corresponding 
(
x
,
y
,
z
)
(x,y,z) values and check if they satisfy all the original equations.

let's start with the first valid combination:

1. 
a

a=1, 
b

b=1, 
c

(

=

+
2019
=
4037
x=2018−2019a=2018−2019×1=2018−2019=−1,
y=2018−2019b=2018−2019×1=−1,
z=2018−2019c=2018−2019×(−1)=2018+2019=4037
so, 
(
x

y
,
z
)
=
(
−
1
,
−
1
,
4037
)
(x,y,z)=(−1,−1,4037)

now, let's verify if these values satisfy the original equations:

z=2018−2019⋅sign(x+y)=2018−2019⋅sign(−1+(−1))=2018−2019⋅sign(−2)=2018−2019×(−1)=2018+2019=4037, which matches.

great, this combination works.

this combination works as well.

so, there are three valid combinations for 
(
a
,
b
,
c
)
(a,b,c), each corresponding to a unique triple 
(
x
,
y
,
z
)
(x,y,z).

are there any other possibilities?

well, earlier, i considered that 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c could only be 1 or -1, and indeed, in the valid cases, that's what they are.

but just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any cases where 
a
a, 
b
b, or 
c
c could be 0.

wait, but from earlier, when i tried to set 
y
+
z
=
0
y+z=0, it led to a contradiction because it forced 
x
x to be both 2018 and -1, which is impossible.

similarly, trying to set any of the sums 
y
+
z
y+z, 
x
+
z
x+z, or 
x
+
y
x+y to zero leads to inconsistencies in the equations.

therefore, 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c cannot be zero in any valid solution.

hence, the only possible solutions are the three triples we found.

wait a minute, but earlier, when i listed the possible 
(
a
,
b
,
c
)
(a,b,c) combinations, i only considered -1 and 1, and got three valid triples.

is there a possibility of more solutions if i consider other values or other constraints?

let me see.

alternatively, perhaps i can look for solutions where two variables are equal or something like that, but given the symmetry in the equations, i think the three solutions i found cover all possibilities.

let me summarize:

the three valid solutions are:

1. 
(
x
,
y
,
z
)
=
(
−
1
,
−
1
,
4037
)
(x,y,z)=(−1,−1,4037)

2. 
(
x
,
y
,
z
)
=
(
−
1
,
4037
,
−
1
)
(x,y,z)=(−1,4037,−1)

3. 
(
x
,
y
,
z
)
=
(
4037
,
−
1
,
−
1
)
(x,y,z)=(4037,−1,−1)

each of these satisfies all three original equations.

therefore, the number of such triples is 3.

**final answer**

3
