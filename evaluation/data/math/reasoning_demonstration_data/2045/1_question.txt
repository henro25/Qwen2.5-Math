Problem: In the coordinate plane, consider points $A = (0, 0)$, $B = (11, 0)$, and $C = (18, 0)$.  Line $\ell_A$ has slope 1 and passes through $A$.  Line $\ell_B$ is vertical and passes through $B$.  Line $\ell_C$ has slope $-1$ and passes through $C$.  The three lines $\ell_A$, $\ell_B$, and $\ell_C$ begin rotating clockwise about points $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively.  They rotate at the same angular rate.  At any given time, the three lines form a triangle.  Determine the largest possible area of such a triangle.
