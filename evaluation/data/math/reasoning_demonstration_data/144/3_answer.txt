Answer: To solve the problem, we'll use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

1. **Total students in drama club:** 50

2. **Students taking mathematics (M):** 36

3. **Students taking physics (P):** 27

4. **Students taking both mathematics and physics (M ∩ P):** 20

Using the inclusion-exclusion principle:

\[
\text{Students taking at least one subject (M ∪ P)} = M + P - (M ∩ P)
\]

\[
= 36 + 27 - 20 = 43
\]

Now, subtract the number of students taking at least one subject from the total number of students to find those taking neither:

\[
\text{Students taking neither} = \text{Total students} - \text{Students taking at least one subject}
\]

\[
= 50 - 43 = 7
\]

**Answer:** 7 students take neither mathematics nor physics.
