Reasoning: Let's tackle this vector problem. so, we have three vectors: a, b, and c. we're given that the magnitudes of a and b are both 1, and the magnitude of c is 2. there's also this equation involving a cross product: a cross (a cross c) plus b equals zero. and we need to find all possible angles θ between a and c.

first off, i remember that the cross product of two vectors is another vector that's perpendicular to both of them, and its magnitude is related to the sine of the angle between them. but here, we have a cross product of a cross product, which might be a bit tricky.

i recall there's a vector identity for something like a cross (b cross c). let me see... oh, right! it's the vector triple product. the formula is a cross (b cross c) equals (a dot c)b minus (a dot b)c. so, applying that here, where a is a and b cross c is (a cross c), we get:

a cross (a cross c) = (a · c)a - (a · a)c.

okay, so plugging that into the original equation:

(a · c)a - (a · a)c + b = 0.

now, i know that a · a is just the magnitude of a squared, which is 1, since ||a|| = 1. so, this simplifies to:

(a · c)a - 1*c + b = 0.

let's rearrange this:

(a · c)a - c + b = 0.

hmm, maybe i can solve for b here:

b = c - (a · c)a.

now, i need to find the angle θ between a and c. the dot product a · c is equal to ||a|| ||c|| cos θ, which is 1 * 2 * cos θ = 2 cos θ.

so, b = c - 2 cos θ a.

now, since ||b|| = 1 and ||c|| = 2, and ||a|| = 1, maybe i can find an expression involving cos θ by taking the magnitude of both sides.

let's compute ||b||^2:

||b||^2 = ||c - 2 cos θ a||^2.

expanding the right-hand side:

||c||^2 - 4 cos θ (a · c) + 4 cos² θ ||a||^2.

we know ||c||^2 = 4, a · c = 2 cos θ, and ||a||^2 = 1.

plugging these in:

1 = 4 - 4 cos θ * (2 cos θ) + 4 cos² θ * 1.

simplify:

1 = 4 - 8 cos² θ + 4 cos² θ.

combine like terms:

1 = 4 - 4 cos² θ.

now, subtract 4 from both sides:

-3 = -4 cos² θ.

divide both sides by -4:

3/4 = cos² θ.

so, cos θ = ±√(3)/2.

therefore, θ = 30 degrees or 150 degrees.

wait a minute, let me double-check that. if cos θ = √3/2, then θ = 30 degrees, and if cos θ = -√3/2, then θ = 150 degrees. that seems right.

is there any other possible value for θ? well, cosine is positive in the first and fourth quadrants, and negative in the second and third, but since θ is the angle between two vectors, it should be between 0 and 180 degrees. so, 30 and 150 degrees are the only possible solutions.

let me see if there's another way to approach this to confirm. maybe using the original cross product equation.

starting again with a cross (a cross c) + b = 0.

using the vector triple product identity again:

a cross (a cross c) = (a · c)a - (a · a)c = (2 cos θ)a - c.

so, (2 cos θ)a - c + b = 0.

which rearranges to b = c - 2 cos θ a.

this is the same as before.

taking magnitudes:

||b||^2 = ||c - 2 cos θ a||^2 = 1.

expanding:

||c||^2 - 4 cos θ (a · c) + 4 cos² θ ||a||^2 = 1.

we know ||c||^2 = 4, a · c = 2 cos θ, and ||a||^2 = 1.

plugging in:

4 - 4 cos θ (2 cos θ) + 4 cos² θ = 1.

simplify:

4 - 8 cos² θ + 4 cos² θ = 1.

which again gives:

4 - 4 cos² θ = 1.

so, -4 cos² θ = -3.

thus, cos² θ = 3/4, and cos θ = ±√3/2.

therefore, θ = 30° or 150°.

i think that's solid. no other angles satisfy this equation within the range of 0 to 180 degrees for the angle between two vectors.

just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any constraints i might have missed. for example, if θ were 0°, then a and c are parallel, and the cross product a cross c would be zero. plugging into the original equation:

a cross (a cross c) + b = a cross 0 + b = 0 + b = b = 0.

but ||b|| = 1, so b can't be zero. so θ = 0° is not possible.

similarly, if θ = 180°, a and c are anti-parallel, and a cross c is still zero, leading to the same issue as above. so θ = 180° is also not possible.

therefore, the only possible angles are 30° and 150°.
