Problem: A number is divisible by $8$ if the number formed by its last $3$ digits is divisible by $8.$ For example, the number $47\,389\,248$ is divisible by $8$ because $248$ is divisible by $8.$ However, $47\,389\,284$ is not divisible by $8$ because $284$ is not divisible by $8.$

If $992\,466\,1A6$ is divisible by $8,$ where $A$ represents one digit, what is the sum of the possible values of $A?$
