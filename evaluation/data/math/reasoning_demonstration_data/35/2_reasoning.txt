Reasoning: 
Alright, let's dive into this problem. So, we have three numbers: x, y, and z. Their sum is 165. That means x + y + z = 165. Got it.

Now, it says the smallest number is x, and when you multiply x by 7, you get this value n. So, n = 7x. Okay, that's straightforward.

Then, it says that n is obtained by subtracting 9 from the largest number y. So, n = y - 9. Hmm, interesting. And also, n is obtained by adding 9 to the third number z. So, n = z + 9.

Wait a minute, so n is equal to both y - 9 and z + 9, and also to 7x. So, that gives us a system of equations to work with.

Let me list them out:

1. x + y + z = 165

2. n = 7x

3. n = y - 9

4. n = z + 9

So, from equations 3 and 4, we can set y - 9 equal to z + 9 because both are equal to n. So, y - 9 = z + 9.

Solving that, y - z = 18. So, y is 18 more than z. That's one relationship.

Also, since n = 7x and n = y - 9, we can set 7x = y - 9. So, y = 7x + 9.

Similarly, since n = z + 9 and n = 7x, then z + 9 = 7x, so z = 7x - 9.

Now, we have expressions for y and z in terms of x. So, let's plug those back into the sum equation.

x + y + z = 165

Substitute y with 7x + 9 and z with 7x - 9:

x + (7x + 9) + (7x - 9) = 165

Simplify:

x + 7x + 9 + 7x - 9 = 165

Combine like terms:

15x = 165

So, x = 11.

Now that we have x, we can find y and z.

y = 7x + 9 = 7*11 + 9 = 77 + 9 = 86

z = 7x - 9 = 7*11 - 9 = 77 - 9 = 68

Let me check if these add up to 165:

11 + 86 + 68 = 165

Yes, that checks out.

Now, to find the product of the three numbers: x * y * z = 11 * 86 * 68

Let me calculate that step by step.

First, 11 * 86 = 946

Then, 946 * 68

Let's break that down:

946 * 70 = 66,220

But since it's 68, which is 70 - 2, so subtract 946*2 = 1,892 from 66,220.

66,220 - 1,892 = 64,328

So, the product is 64,328.

Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure.

946 * 68:

946 * 60 = 56,760

946 * 8 = 7,568

Add them up: 56,760 + 7,568 = 64,328

Yes, that's correct.
