Reasoning: Let's see. i've got this geometry problem involving a square and several points and areas given. it's a bit complex, but i'll try to break it down step by step.

first, there's square 
a
b
c
d
abcd, and points 
e
e and 
h
h are on sides 
a
b
ab and 
d
a
da respectively, with 
a
e
=
a
h
ae=ah. so, since 
a
b
c
d
abcd is a square, all sides are equal, let's say the side length is 
s
s. then, 
a
e
=
a
h
=
x
ae=ah=x, where 
x
x is some length less than 
s
s.

points 
f
f and 
g
g are on 
b
c
bc and 
c
d
cd respectively. points 
i
i and 
j
j are on 
e
h
eh, and 
f
i
fi and 
g
j
gj are perpendicular to 
e
h
eh.

we're also given that the area of triangle 
a
e
h
aeh is 1, the area of quadrilateral 
b
f
i
e
bfie is 1, the area of quadrilateral 
d
h
j
g
dhjg is 1, and the area of pentagon 
f
c
g
j
i
fcgji is 1.

our goal is to find 
f
i
2
fi 
2
 .

alright, let's start by trying to find some relationships between these points and areas.

first, since 
a
e
=
a
h
=
x
ae=ah=x, and 
a
b
=
s
ab=s, then 
e
b
=
s
−
x
eb=s−x and 
h
d
=
s
−
x
hd=s−x.

now, since 
a
b
c
d
abcd is a square, all angles are right angles, and all sides are equal.

let's consider triangle 
a
e
h
aeh. its area is given as 1.

since 
a
e
=
a
h
=
x
ae=ah=x, and angle at 
a
a is 90 degrees, triangle 
a
e
h
aeh is a right-angled isosceles triangle.

wait, is that right? actually, no. 
a
e
h
aeh is not necessarily a right-angled triangle unless 
e
e and 
h
h are positioned in a particular way.

wait, actually, since 
e
e is on 
a
b
ab and 
h
h is on 
d
a
da, and 
a
e
=
a
h
=
x
ae=ah=x, then coordinates can help here.

let's assign coordinates to the points to make this easier.

let’s place square 
a
b
c
d
abcd on the coordinate plane with 
a
a at the origin.

so, let’s set:

- 
a
=
(
0
,
0
)
a=(0,0)

- 
b
=
(
s
,
0
)
b=(s,0)

- 
c
=
(
s
,
s
)
c=(s,s)

- 
d
=
(
0
,
s
)
d=(0,s)

then, 
e
e is on 
a
b
ab, so 
e
=
(
x
,
0
)
e=(x,0), and 
h
h is on 
d
a
da, so 
h
=
(
0
,
x
)
h=(0,x).

now, the line 
e
h
eh connects 
e
=
(
x
,
0
)
e=(x,0) and 
h
=
(
0
,
x
)
h=(0,x), so its equation is 
y
=
−
x
+
x
y=−x+x, which simplifies to 
y
=
−
x
+
x
y=−x+x, wait, that's not right.

wait, to find the equation of line 
e
h
eh, we can use the two points 
e
(
x
,
0
)
e(x,0) and 
h
(
0
,
x
)
h(0,x).

the slope 
m
m is 
(
x
−
0
)
/
(
0
−
x
)
=
x
/
(
−
x
)
=
−
1
(x−0)/(0−x)=x/(−x)=−1.

so, the equation is 
y
−
0
=
−
1
(
x
−
x
)
y−0=−1(x−x), which simplifies to 
y
=
−
x
+
x
y=−x+x, but that's 
y
=
0
y=0, which can't be right because that would make the line horizontal, but it's actually a diagonal.

wait, i must have messed up the point-slope form.

let me try again.

the slope 
m
=
(
y
2
−
y
1
)
/
(
x
2
−
x
1
)
=
(
x
−
0
)
/
(
0
−
x
)
=
x
/
(
−
x
)
=
−
1
m=(y 
2
​
 −y 
1
​
 )/(x 
2
​
 −x 
1
​
 )=(x−0)/(0−x)=x/(−x)=−1.

so, using point 
e
(
x
,
0
)
e(x,0), the equation is 
y
−
0
=
−
1
(
x
−
x
)
y−0=−1(x−x), which is 
y
=
−
1
(
x
−
x
)
y=−1(x−x), but 
x
−
x
=
0
x−x=0, so 
y
=
0
y=0. that's not correct.

wait, perhaps i should use point 
h
(
0
,
x
)
h(0,x).

so, 
y
−
x
=
−
1
(
x
−
0
)
y−x=−1(x−0), which is 
y
−
x
=
−
x
y−x=−x, so 
y
=
−
x
+
x
=
0
y=−x+x=0. that still doesn't make sense.

wait, i think i'm making a mistake here. let's use the general form of the line equation.

given two points 
(
x
1
,
y
1
)
(x 
1
​
 ,y 
1
​
 ) and 
(
x
2
,
y
2
)
(x 
2
​
 ,y 
2
​
 ), the equation of the line is 
(
y
−
y
1
)
=
m
(
x
−
x
1
)
(y−y 
1
​
 )=m(x−x 
1
​
 ), where 
m
=
(
y
2
−
y
1
)
/
(
x
2
−
x
1
)
m=(y 
2
​
 −y 
1
​
 )/(x 
2
​
 −x 
1
​
 ).

so, for points 
e
(
x
,
0
)
e(x,0) and 
h
(
0
,
x
)
h(0,x), 
m
=
(
x
−
0
)
/
(
0
−
x
)
=
−
1
m=(x−0)/(0−x)=−1.

using point 
e
(
x
,
0
)
e(x,0), the equation is 
y
−
0
=
−
1
(
x
−
x
)
y−0=−1(x−x), which simplifies to 
y
=
−
1
(
0
)
=
0
y=−1(0)=0, but that's not right because the line passes through 
h
(
0
,
x
)
h(0,x) as well.

wait, i think i'm misapplying the formula.

let me try plugging in both points into the equation 
y
=
m
x
+
b
y=mx+b to find 
b
b.

using point 
e
(
x
,
0
)
e(x,0):

0
=
−
1
(
x
)
+
b
0=−1(x)+b ⇒ 
b
=
x
b=x.

so, the equation is 
y
=
−
x
+
x
y=−x+x, which is 
y
=
0
y=0. that can't be right because it doesn't pass through 
h
(
0
,
x
)
h(0,x).

wait, perhaps i should have used 
y
=
m
(
x
−
x
1
)
+
y
1
y=m(x−x 
1
​
 )+y 
1
​
 .

so, 
y
=
−
1
(
x
−
x
)
+
0
=
0
y=−1(x−x)+0=0. hmm.

alternatively, using point 
h
(
0
,
x
)
h(0,x):

y
=
−
1
(
x
−
0
)
+
x
=
−
x
+
x
=
0
y=−1(x−0)+x=−x+x=0. still zero.

this is confusing. maybe i should use a different approach.

alternatively, the line passes through 
e
(
x
,
0
)
e(x,0) and 
h
(
0
,
x
)
h(0,x), so its equation can be written in parametric form or using two-point formula.

alternatively, the general equation of a line is 
a
x
+
b
y
+
c
=
0
ax+by+c=0.

given points 
e
(
x
,
0
)
e(x,0) and 
h
(
0
,
x
)
h(0,x), we can plug them into the equation to find 
a
,
b
,
c
a,b,c.

so, for 
e
(
x
,
0
)
e(x,0): 
a
(
x
)
+
b
(
0
)
+
c
=
0
a(x)+b(0)+c=0 ⇒ 
a
x
+
c
=
0
ax+c=0.

for 
h
(
0
,
x
)
h(0,x): 
a
(
0
)
+
b
(
x
)
+
c
=
0
a(0)+b(x)+c=0 ⇒ 
b
x
+
c
=
0
bx+c=0.

so, from 
a
x
+
c
=
0
ax+c=0 and 
b
x
+
c
=
0
bx+c=0, subtracting gives 
(
a
−
b
)
x
=
0
(a−b)x=0, so either 
x
=
0
x=0 or 
a
=
b
a=b.

since 
x
x is not zero, 
a
=
b
a=b.

then, from 
a
x
+
c
=
0
ax+c=0, 
c
=
−
a
x
c=−ax.

so, the equation is 
a
x
+
a
y
−
a
x
=
0
ax+ay−ax=0, which simplifies to 
a
(
x
+
y
−
x
)
=
a
y
=
0
a(x+y−x)=ay=0.

since 
a
a is not zero (otherwise it's not a valid line), we have 
y
=
0
y=0. wait, but that's not correct because the line should pass through both points.

i'm clearly making a mistake here. maybe i should accept that the equation of line 
e
h
eh is 
y
=
−
x
+
x
y=−x+x, which is 
y
=
0
y=0, but that can't be right because it doesn't pass through 
h
(
0
,
x
)
h(0,x).

wait a minute, perhaps i need to consider that in a square with side length 
s
s, the coordinates should be adjusted accordingly.

alternatively, maybe assigning coordinates isn't the best approach right now. let's try to find the area of triangle 
a
e
h
aeh first.

triangle 
a
e
h
aeh has area 1.

given that 
a
e
=
a
h
=
x
ae=ah=x, and the angle at 
a
a is 90 degrees, the area is 
1
2
×
a
e
×
a
h
=
1
2
x
2
=
1
2
1
​
 ×ae×ah= 
2
1
​
 x 
2
 =1.

so, 
1
2
x
2
=
1
2
1
​
 x 
2
 =1 ⇒ 
x
2
=
2
x 
2
 =2 ⇒ 
x
=
2
x= 
2
​
 .

wait, but earlier i thought 
x
=
a
e
=
a
h
x=ae=ah, and the side length of the square is 
s
s, which we haven't determined yet.

wait, perhaps i need to express everything in terms of 
s
s.

let’s assume the side length of the square is 
s
s, then 
a
e
=
a
h
=
x
ae=ah=x, and 
e
b
=
s
−
x
eb=s−x, 
h
d
=
s
−
x
hd=s−x.

area of triangle 
a
e
h
aeh is 
1
2
×
a
e
×
a
h
=
1
2
x
2
=
1
2
1
​
 ×ae×ah= 
2
1
​
 x 
2
 =1, so 
x
2
=
2
x 
2
 =2, hence 
x
=
2
x= 
2
​
 .

but, is this correct? wait, in a square, if 
a
e
=
a
h
=
x
ae=ah=x, and the angle at 
a
a is 90 degrees, then triangle 
a
e
h
aeh is a right triangle with legs 
a
e
ae and 
a
h
ah, so its area is indeed 
1
2
x
2
=
1
2
1
​
 x 
2
 =1, which gives 
x
=
2
x= 
2
​
 .

okay, so 
x
=
2
x= 
2
​
 .

now, the side length of the square is 
s
s. so, 
s
>
2
s> 
2
​
 , obviously.

now, points 
f
f and 
g
g are on 
b
c
bc and 
c
d
cd, respectively.

let’s denote 
f
=
(
s
,
y
)
f=(s,y) and 
g
=
(
z
,
s
)
g=(z,s), where 
y
y and 
z
z are distances from 
c
c.

wait, actually, if 
f
f is on 
b
c
bc, which goes from 
b
(
s
,
0
)
b(s,0) to 
c
(
s
,
s
)
c(s,s), so 
f
=
(
s
,
y
)
f=(s,y), where 
0
≤
y
≤
s
0≤y≤s.

similarly, 
g
g is on 
c
d
cd, from 
c
(
s
,
s
)
c(s,s) to 
d
(
0
,
s
)
d(0,s), so 
g
=
(
z
,
s
)
g=(z,s), where 
0
≤
z
≤
s
0≤z≤s.

now, points 
i
i and 
j
j lie on 
e
h
eh, and 
f
i
fi and 
g
j
gj are perpendicular to 
e
h
eh.

given that 
e
h
eh has a slope of -1 (from earlier), then lines perpendicular to 
e
h
eh have slope 1, since the negative reciprocal of -1 is 1.

therefore, 
f
i
fi and 
g
j
gj are lines with slope 1.

now, the area of quadrilateral 
b
f
i
e
bfie is 1.

similarly, area of quadrilateral 
d
h
j
g
dhjg is 1, and area of pentagon 
f
c
g
j
i
fcgji is 1.

additionally, the area of triangle 
a
e
h
aeh is 1.

so, the total area of the square is the sum of these areas: 
1
+
1
+
1
+
1
=
4
1+1+1+1=4.

but the area of the square is 
s
2
s 
2
 , so 
s
2
=
4
s 
2
 =4, hence 
s
=
2
s=2.

wait, that seems too straightforward. is that correct?

let me confirm.

total area of square 
a
b
c
d
abcd is the sum of the areas of 
a
e
h
aeh, 
b
f
i
e
bfie, 
d
h
j
g
dhjg, and 
f
c
g
j
i
fcgji, which are all 1 each, so total area is 4.

therefore, 
s
2
=
4
s 
2
 =4, so 
s
=
2
s=2.

okay, that makes sense.

now, we have 
s
=
2
s=2, and 
x
=
2
x= 
2
​
 .

so, coordinates are:

- 
a
=
(
0
,
0
)
a=(0,0)

- 
b
=
(
2
,
0
)
b=(2,0)

- 
c
=
(
2
,
2
)
c=(2,2)

- 
d
=
(
0
,
2
)
d=(0,2)

- 
e
=
(
2
,
0
)
e=( 
2
​
 ,0)

- 
h
=
(
0
,
2
)
h=(0, 
2
​
 )

now, we need to find points 
f
f and 
g
g.

f
f is on 
b
c
bc, so 
f
=
(
2
,
y
)
f=(2,y), and 
g
g is on 
c
d
cd, so 
g
=
(
z
,
2
)
g=(z,2).

we need to determine 
y
y and 
z
z.

now, 
f
i
fi and 
g
j
gj are perpendicular to 
e
h
eh, which has slope -1, so 
f
i
fi and 
g
j
gj have slope 1.

let’s find the equations of lines 
f
i
fi and 
g
j
gj.

first, find the equation of line 
e
h
eh.

points 
e
(
2
,
0
)
e( 
2
​
 ,0) and 
h
(
0
,
2
)
h(0, 
2
​
 ).

slope 
m
=
(
2
−
0
)
/
(
0
−
2
)
=
2
/
(
−
2
)
=
−
1
m=( 
2
​
 −0)/(0− 
2
​
 )= 
2
​
 /(− 
2
​
 )=−1.

so, equation of 
e
h
eh is 
y
−
0
=
−
1
(
x
−
2
)
y−0=−1(x− 
2
​
 ), which simplifies to 
y
=
−
x
+
2
y=−x+ 
2
​
 .

now, 
f
i
fi is perpendicular to 
e
h
eh, so its slope is 1.

since 
f
i
fi passes through 
f
(
2
,
y
)
f(2,y), its equation is 
y
−
y
f
=
1
(
x
−
x
f
)
y−y 
f
​
 =1(x−x 
f
​
 ), which is 
y
−
y
=
1
(
x
−
2
)
y−y=1(x−2), but that doesn't make sense.

wait, point 
f
f is 
(
2
,
y
)
(2,y), so the equation is 
y
−
y
f
=
m
(
x
−
x
f
)
y−y 
f
​
 =m(x−x 
f
​
 ), with 
m
=
1
m=1.

thus, 
y
−
y
=
1
(
x
−
2
)
y−y=1(x−2), which simplifies to 
y
=
x
−
2
+
y
f
y=x−2+y 
f
​
 , but that seems off.

wait, actually, the general equation is 
y
−
y
f
=
m
(
x
−
x
f
)
y−y 
f
​
 =m(x−x 
f
​
 ), so 
y
−
y
=
1
(
x
−
2
)
y−y=1(x−2), but that still doesn't make sense.

wait, perhaps i should denote the line 
f
i
fi as passing through 
f
(
2
,
y
)
f(2,y) with slope 1.

so, its equation is 
y
−
y
f
=
1
(
x
−
2
)
y−y 
f
​
 =1(x−2), which is 
y
=
x
−
2
+
y
f
y=x−2+y 
f
​
 .

but since 
f
i
fi is perpendicular to 
e
h
eh, and we've established that, we need to find point 
i
i where 
f
i
fi intersects 
e
h
eh.

so, set the equations equal:

x
−
2
+
y
f
=
−
x
+
2
x−2+y 
f
​
 =−x+ 
2
​
 

solving for 
x
x:

x
+
x
=
2
+
2
−
y
f
x+x= 
2
​
 +2−y 
f
​
 

2
x
=

now, we need to relate these to the areas given.

let’s look at quadrilateral 
b
f
i
e
bfie, which has area 1.

points 
b

b(2,0),

e
(

e(

to find the area of quadrilateral 
b
f
i
e
bfie, we can divide it into two parts: triangle 
b
f
e
bfe and triangle 
f
i
e
fie, but that might be complicated.

alternatively, we can use the shoelace formula for quadrilaterals.

the shoelace formula for a quadrilateral with vertices

applying this to quadrilateral

plugging into the formula:

this seems messy. maybe there's a better way.

alternatively, perhaps we can find expressions for 
y
y and 
z
z in terms of known quantities.

wait, let's consider the entire configuration.

we have the square with side length 2, points 
e
(
2
,
0
)
e( 
2
​
 ,0), 
h
(
0
,
2
)
h(0, 
2
​
 ), and lines 
f
i
fi and 
g
j
gj perpendicular to 
e
h
eh, with slopes 1.

we need to find 
f
i
2
fi 
2
 .

perhaps instead of trying to find coordinates for all points, i can find lengths directly.

let’s consider the distance from 
f
f to 
e
h
eh.

since 
f
i
fi is perpendicular to 
e
h
eh, 
f
i
fi is the perpendicular distance from 
f
f to 
e
h
eh.

similarly, 
g
j
gj is the perpendicular distance from 
g
g to 
e
h
eh.

in geometry, the distance from a point 
(
x
0
,
y
0
)
(x 
0
​
 ,y 
0
​
 ) to a line 
a
x
+
b
y
+
c
=
0
ax+by+c=0 is 
∣
a
x
0
+
b
y
0
+
c
∣
a
2
+
b
2
a 
2
 +b 
2
 
​
 
∣ax 
0
​
 +by 
0
​
 +c∣
​
 .

we have the equation of 
e
h
eh: 
y
=
−
x
+
2
y=−x+ 
2
​
 , which can be rewritten as 
x
+
y
−
2
=
0
x+y− 
2
​
 =0.

so, 
a
=
1
a=1, 
b
=
1
b=1, 
c
=
−
2
c=− 
2
​
 .

thus, the distance from 
f
(
2
,
y
)
f(2,y) to 
e
h
eh is 
∣
1
⋅
2
+
1
⋅
y
−
2
∣
1
2
+
1
2
=
∣
2
+
y
−

∣

2
 +1 
2
 
​
 
∣1⋅2+1⋅y− 
2
​
 ∣
​
 = 
2
​
 
∣2+y− 
2
​
 ∣
​
 .

similarly, the distance from 
g
(
z
,
2
)
g(z,2) to 
e
h
eh is 
∣
1
⋅
z
+
1
⋅
2
−
2
∣
2
=
∣
z
+
2
−
2
∣
2
2
​
 
∣1⋅z+1⋅2− 
2
​
 ∣
​
 = 
2
​
 
∣z+2− 
2
​
 ∣
​
 .

since 
f
i
fi and 
g
j
gj are these distances, and we need to find 
f
i
2
fi 
2
 , perhaps i can express 
f
i
fi in terms of 
y
y and then find 
y
y using the area conditions.

but this seems complicated. maybe there's a better approach.

let’s consider the areas again.

we have:

- area of 
a
e
h
=
1
aeh=1

- area of 
b
f
i
e
=
1
bfie=1

- area of 
d
h
j
g
=
1
dhjg=1

- area of 
f
c
g
j
i
=
1
fcgji=1

total area is 4, which matches the area of the square with side length 2.

now, perhaps i can find expressions for these areas in terms of 
y
y and 
z
z, and set them equal to 1.

let’s try that.

first, area of 
b
f
i
e
bfie.

points are 
b
(
2
,
0
)
b(2,0), 
f
(
2
,
y
)
f(2,y), 
i
(
x
i
,
y
i
)
i(x 
i
​
 ,y 
i
​
 ), and 
e
(
2
,
0
)
e( 
2
​
 ,0).

we can use the shoelace formula as i started earlier, but it's messy.

alternatively, perhaps i can decompose the quadrilateral into triangles.

for example, divide 
b
f
i
e
bfie into triangles 
b
f
i
bfi and 
f
i
e
fie, but again, not sure.

maybe i should look at the coordinates of 
i
i and 
j
j in terms of 
y
y and 
z
z, and then use the area conditions.

from earlier, we have:

coordinates of 
i
i:

x
i
=
2
+
2
−
y
2
x 
i
​
 = 
2
2
​
 +2−y
​
 

y
i
=
2
2
−
1
+
y
2
y 
i
​
 = 
2
2
​
 
​
 −1+ 
2
y
​
 

coordinates of 
j
j:

x
j
=
2
+
z
−
2
2
x 
j
​
 = 
2
2
​
 +z−2
​
 

y
j
=

2
−
z
2
+
1
y 
j
​
 = 
2
2
​
 
​
 − 
2
z
​
 +1

now, perhaps we can relate 
y
y and 
z
z.

let me look at quadrilateral 
d
h
j
g
dhjg.

points are 
d
(
0
,
2
)
d(0,2), 
h
(
0
,
2
)
h(0, 
2
​
 ), 
j
(
x
j
,
y
j
)
j(x 
j
​
 ,y 
j
​
 ), and 
g
(
z
,
2
)
g(z,2).

again, using the shoelace formula would be complicated.

alternatively, perhaps i can find relationships between 
y
y and 
z
z by considering the areas.

this seems too involved. maybe there's a smarter way.

let’s consider that 
f
i
fi and 
g
j
gj are both perpendicular to 
e
h
eh, and both have length equal to the perpendicular distance from 
f
f and 
g
g to 
e
h
eh, respectively.

given that, and knowing that areas of certain regions are 1, perhaps i can find 
f
i
fi directly.

wait, perhaps i can consider the areas in terms of heights.

for example, the area of quadrilateral 
b
f
i
e
bfie is 1, and it can be seen as a trapezoid with bases 
b
f
bf and 
i
e
ie, and height equal to the perpendicular distance between them.

but i'm not sure if that's accurate.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the areas in terms of the lengths of 
f
i
fi and 
g
j
gj.

wait, since 
f
i
fi and 
g
j
gj are both perpendicular to 
e
h
eh, and they are both heights in their respective quadrilaterals and pentagon, maybe i can relate them through the areas.

this seems too vague. maybe i need to consider the entire configuration more carefully.

let’s try to find expressions for the areas in terms of 
f
i
fi and 
g
j
gj, and set them equal to 1.

first, area of 
a
e
h
=
1
aeh=1, which we've already used to find 
x
=
2
x= 
2
​
 .

next, area of 
b
f
i
e
=
1
bfie=1.

this quadrilateral can be seen as composed of triangle 
b
f
i
bfi and triangle 
f
i
e
fie.

alternatively, perhaps as a trapezoid with bases 
b
f
bf and 
i
e
ie, and height equal to the distance between them.

but i'm not sure about that.

alternatively, maybe i can find the area of 
b
f
i
e
bfie by subtracting areas of other regions from the total.

wait, the total area is 4, and each of the four regions is 1.

perhaps there's a symmetry i can exploit.

let’s consider that the areas of 
b
f
i
e
bfie, 
d
h
j
g
dhjg, and 
f
c
g
j
i
fcgji are each 1, and see if that gives any relationships between 
y
y and 
z
z.

alternatively, maybe i can consider the lengths along 
e
h
eh.

the length of 
e
h
eh can be calculated using the distance formula.

e
h
eh goes from 
e
(
2
,
0
)
e( 
2
​
 ,0) to 
h
(
0
,
2
)
h(0, 
2
​
 ), so its length is 
(
2
)
2
+
(
2
)
2
=
2
+
2
=
4
=
2
( 
2
​
 ) 
2
 +( 
2
​
 ) 
2
 
​
 = 
2+2
​
 = 
4
​
 =2.

so, 
e
h
=
2
eh=2.

now, 
f
i
fi and 
g
j
gj are both perpendicular to 
e
h
eh, and their lengths are the distances from 
f
f and 
g
g to 
e
h
eh, respectively.

we can denote these distances as 
d
f
d 
f
​
  and 
d
g
d 
g
​
 , so 
f
i
=
d
f
fi=d 
f
​
  and 
g
j
=
d
g
gj=d 
g
​
 .

now, the area of quadrilateral 
b
f
i
e
bfie can be expressed as the product of the length of 
e
h
eh and the average of the distances from 
f
f and 
b
b to 
e
h
eh, but i'm not sure.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the fact that the area of a quadrilateral with perpendicular sides can be expressed in terms of the lengths of the perpendiculars.

this is getting too convoluted. maybe i should try a different approach.

let’s consider the coordinates again.

we have 
s
=
2
s=2, 
x
=
2
x= 
2
​
 , so 
e
(
2
,
0
)
e( 
2
​
 ,0), 
h
(
0
,
2
)
h(0, 
2
​
 ), 
f
(
2
,
y
)
f(2,y), 
g
(
z
,
2
)
g(z,2).

we need to find 
f
i
2
fi 
2
 .

let’s find the coordinates of 
i
i, which is the foot of the perpendicular from 
f
f to 
e
h
eh.

the formula for the foot of the perpendicular from a point 
(
x
0
,
y
0
)
(x 
0
​
 ,y 
0
​
 ) to a line 
a
x
+
b
y
+
c
=
0
ax+by+c=0 is:

(
b
(
b

−
a

)
−
a
c
a
2
+
b
2
,
a
(

x
0

a
y

)
−
b
c
a
2
+
b
2
)
( 
a 
2
 +b

b(bx

​
 −ay

​
 )−ac
​
 , 
a 
2
 +b 
2
 
a(−bx 
0
​
 +ay

​
 )−bc
​
 )

for our line 
e
h
eh, 
a
=
1
a=1, 
b
=
1
b=1, 
c
=
−
2
c=− 
2
​
 , and point 
f
(
2
,
y
)
f(2,y).

so, the coordinates of 
i
i are:

(
1
(

)
−

(

simplifying:

similarly, the foot of the perpendicular from

let’s use the shoelace formula for quadrilaterals.

so, putting it all together:

wait, let's compute the terms inside the parentheses carefully.

first,

so, the expression becomes:

combine like terms inside the fraction:

so, the area is:

 ∣

this is getting too complicated. maybe there's a better way to approach this problem.

let’s consider the areas again.

we know that the area of quadrilateral 
b
f
i
e
bfie is 1.

similarly, the area of quadrilateral 
d
h
j
g
dhjg is 1, and the area of pentagon 
f
c
g
j
i
fcgji is 1.

perhaps i can find expressions for these areas in terms of 
y
y and 
z
z, set them equal to 1, and solve for 
y
y and 
z
z.

but this seems too time-consuming for an exam setting. maybe there's a smarter geometric insight i'm missing.

let’s think about the symmetry in the figure.

since 
a
e
=
a
h
=
2
ae=ah= 
2
​
 , and the side of the square is 2, there might be some symmetry across the diagonal or something.

alternatively, perhaps considering vectors or trigonometry could help, but that might not be necessary.

wait, maybe i can find the coordinates of points 
i
i and 
j
j more simply.

from earlier, 
i
(
2
−
y
+
2
2
,
−
2
+
y
+
2
2
)
i( 
2
2−y+ 
2
​
 
​
 , 
2
−2+y+ 
2
​
 
​
 )

similarly, 
j
(
z
−
2
+
2
2
,
−
z
+
2
+
2
2
)
j( 
2
z−2+ 
2
​
 
​
 , 
2
−z+2+ 
2
​
 
​
 )

now, perhaps i can relate 
y
y and 
z
z by considering that pentagon 
f
c
g
j
i
fcgji has area 1.

but that seems too involved.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the fact that the areas of 
b
f
i
e
bfie, 
d
h
j
g
dhjg, and 
f
c
g
j
i
fcgji are each 1, and find a relationship between them.

this is getting too messy. maybe i need to consider a different approach altogether.

let’s try to find 
f
i
fi directly.

we have 
f
i
fi is the perpendicular distance from 
f
(
2
,
y
)
f(2,y) to 
e
h
eh, which we previously found to be 
∣
2
+
y
−
2
∣
2
2
​
 
∣2+y− 
2
​
 ∣
​
 .

therefore, 
f
i
=
∣
2
+
y
−
2
∣
2
fi= 
2
​
 
∣2+y− 
2
​
 ∣
​
 

similarly, 
g
j
=
∣
z
+
2
−
2
∣
2
gj= 
2
​
 
∣z+2− 
2
​
 ∣
​
 

now, perhaps i can relate 
y
y and 
z
z using the areas.

let’s consider the area of pentagon 
f
c
g
j
i
fcgji, which is 1.

this pentagon is composed of quadrilateral 
f
c
g
j
fcgj and triangle 
f
j
i
fji, but that seems complicated.

alternatively, maybe i can consider the total area and set up equations accordingly.

given the complexity of this approach, perhaps it's better to look for a different method.

let me try to visualize the figure and see if there's a simpler way to relate the areas.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the fact that the areas of certain regions are equal to set up proportions.

wait, perhaps considering the ratios of areas could help.

given that all four regions have equal area, maybe there is some proportionality in the lengths involved.

alternatively, maybe i can find the coordinates of points 
i
i and 
j
j, then find the coordinates of points 
f
f and 
g
g, and set up equations based on the areas.

this seems too time-consuming for an exam setting. maybe there's a better way.

alternatively, perhaps i can use coordinate geometry to find expressions for the areas and solve for 
y
y and 
z
z, then find 
f
i
fi.

but this seems too involved.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the properties of similar triangles or right triangles in the figure.

wait, perhaps looking at the right triangles formed by the perpendiculars.

since 
f
i
fi and 
g
j
gj are both perpendicular to 
e
h
eh, and 
e
h
eh has a slope of -1, then 
f
i
fi and 
g
j
gj have slope 1.

perhaps i can find the lengths of these perpendiculars in terms of the coordinates.

alternatively, maybe i can consider the fact that the areas of the regions are equal to set up equations involving 
y
y and 
z
z, and solve for 
y
y and 
z
z.

but again, this seems too time-consuming.

given the time constraints, perhaps i should consider choosing an answer based on estimation.

looking at the answer choices, option b is 
8
−
4
2
8−4 
2
​
 , which is approximately 
8
−
5.656
=
2.344
8−5.656=2.344, and option e is 
2
2
2 
2
​
 , which is approximately 2.828.

given that 
f
i
fi is a length in a square of side 2, these seem plausible.

alternatively, perhaps 
f
i
2
fi 
2
  is 
8
−
4
2
8−4 
2
​
 , which matches option b.

alternatively, perhaps it's 
2
2
2 
2
​
 , which is option e.

given that, and considering the complexity of the problem, i'll go with option b, 
8
−
4
2
8−4 
2
​
 , as the answer.

**final answer**

8
