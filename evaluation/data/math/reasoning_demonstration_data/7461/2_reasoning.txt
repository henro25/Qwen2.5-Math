Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: find the smallest positive integer 
n
n such that all the roots of 
z
4
−
z
2
+
1
=
0
z 
4
 −z 
2
 +1=0 are 
n
th
n 
th
  roots of unity. okay, let's break this down.

first, i know that the 
n
th
n 
th
  roots of unity are the solutions to the equation 
z
n
=
1
z 
n
 =1. so, if all roots of 
z
4
−
z
2
+
1
=
0
z 
4
 −z 
2
 +1=0 are 
n
th
n 
th
  roots of unity, that means each root 
z
z satisfies 
z
n
=
1
z 
n
 =1.

my goal is to find the smallest such 
n
n. so, i need to find the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of all the roots of the given equation.

first, i should probably find the roots of 
z
4
−
z
2
+
1
=
0
z 
4
 −z 
2
 +1=0. maybe i can factor this polynomial or find some substitution to make it easier.

let me try substituting 
w
=
z
2
w=z 
2
 . then the equation becomes 
w
2
−
w
+
1
=
0
w 
2
 −w+1=0. that seems simpler. now, i can solve for 
w
w using the quadratic formula:

w
=
1
±
1
−
4
2
=
1
±
−
3
2
=
1
±
i
3
2
w= 
2
1± 
1−4
​	
 
​	
 = 
2
1± 
−3
​	
 
​	
 = 
2
1±i 
3
​	
 
​	
 
so, 
w
=
1
+
i
3
2
w= 
2
1+i 
3
​	
 
​	
  or 
w
=
1
−
i
3
2
w= 
2
1−i 
3
​	
 
​	
 .

now, recalling that 
w
=
z
2
w=z 
2
 , so 
z
2
=
1
±
i
3
2
z 
2
 = 
2
1±i 
3
​	
 
​	
 . to find 
z
z, i need to take square roots of these complex numbers.

let me write these in polar form to make taking square roots easier. i know that 
1
+
i
3
2
2
1+i 
3
​	
 
​	
  is 
e
i
π
/
3
e 
iπ/3
  because it has magnitude 1 and angle 
π
/
3
π/3. similarly, 
1
−
i
3
2
=
e
−
i
π
/
3
2
1−i 
3
​	
 
​	
 =e 
−iπ/3
 .

therefore, 
z
2
=
e
i
π
/
3
z 
2
 =e 
iπ/3
  or 
z
2
=
e
−
i
π
/
3
z 
2
 =e 
−iπ/3
 . taking square roots:

z
=
±
e
i
π
/
6
and
z
=
±
e
−
i
π
/
6
z=±e 
iπ/6
 andz=±e 
−iπ/6
 
so, the four roots are:

z
1
=
e
i
π
/
6
,
z
2
=
−
e
i
π
/
6
,
z
3
=
e
−
i
π
/
6
,
z
4
=
−
e
−
i
π
/
6
z 
1
​	
 =e 
iπ/6
 ,z 
2
​	
 =−e 
iπ/6
 ,z 
3
​	
 =e 
−iπ/6
 ,z 
4
​	
 =−e 
−iπ/6
 
alternatively, i can write these as:

z
1
=
e
i
π
/
6
,
z
2
=
e
i
7
π
/
6
,
z
3
=
e
−
i
π
/
6
=
e
i
11
π
/
6
,
z
4
=
e
−
i
7
π
/
6
=
e
i
5
π
/
6
z 
1
​	
 =e 
iπ/6
 ,z 
2
​	
 =e 
i7π/6
 ,z 
3
​	
 =e 
−iπ/6
 =e 
i11π/6
 ,z 
4
​	
 =e 
−i7π/6
 =e 
i5π/6
 
wait, let me double-check that:

−
e
i
π
/
6
=
e
i
π
/
6
+
i
π
=
e
i
7
π
/
6
−e 
iπ/6
 =e 
iπ/6+iπ
 =e 
i7π/6
 , and 
−
e
−
i
π
/
6
=
e
−
i
π
/
6
+
i
π
=
e
i
5
π
/
6
−e 
−iπ/6
 =e 
−iπ/6+iπ
 =e 
i5π/6
 . yes, that's correct.

so, the roots are at angles 
π
/
6
π/6, 
5
π
/
6
5π/6, 
7
π
/
6
7π/6, and 
11
π
/
6
11π/6.

now, i need to find the smallest 
n
n such that each of these roots satisfies 
z
n
=
1
z 
n
 =1, meaning that 
e
i
k
π
/
6
e 
ikπ/6
 ^n = 1 for each root.

since 
e
i
θ
=
1
e 
iθ
 =1 when 
θ
θ is a multiple of 
2
π
2π, i have:

e
i
k
π
/
6
⋅
n
=
e
i
n
k
π
/
6
=
1
e 
ikπ/6⋅n
 =e 
inkπ/6
 =1
so, 
n
k
π
/
6
=
2
π
m
nkπ/6=2πm for some integer 
m
m, which simplifies to:

n
k
/
6
=
2
m
nk/6=2m
or:

n
k
=
12
m
nk=12m
since 
k
k is different for each root, i need this to hold for all 
k
k corresponding to each root.

let me list the specific 
k
k values:

for 
z
1
=
e
i
π
/
6
z 
1
​	
 =e 
iπ/6
 , 
k
=
1
k=1

for 
z
2
=
e
i
5
π
/
6
z 
2
​	
 =e 
i5π/6
 , 
k
=
5
k=5

for 
z
3
=
e
i
7
π
/
6
z 
3
​	
 =e 
i7π/6
 , 
k
=
7
k=7

for 
z
4
=
e
i
11
π
/
6
z 
4
​	
 =e 
i11π/6
 , 
k
=
11
k=11

so, for each 
k
k, 
n
k
nk must be a multiple of 12.

in other words, 
12
12 divides 
n
k
nk for each 
k
k.

but since 
k
k and 12 may have common factors, i need to consider the least common multiple that accommodates all these conditions.

alternatively, since these roots are all roots of unity, and they lie on the unit circle at specific angles, the order of each root is the smallest positive integer 
m
m such that 
(
e
i
k
π
/
6
)
m
=
1
(e 
ikπ/6
 ) 
m
 =1, which again requires 
m
k
π
/
6
=
2
π
l
mkπ/6=2πl for some integer 
l
l, leading to 
m
k
=
12
l
mk=12l, so 
m
=
12
l
k
m= 
k
12l
​	
 . for 
m
m to be an integer, 
k
k must divide 
12
l
12l. the smallest such 
m
m for each 
k
k is 
m
=
12
gcd
⁡
(
12
,
k
)
m= 
gcd(12,k)
12
​	
 .

so, for each root, the order is 
m
k
=
12
gcd
⁡
(
12
,
k
)
m 
k
​	
 = 
gcd(12,k)
12
​	
 , where 
k
k is the coefficient in the exponent.

let's calculate 
m
k
m 
k
​	
  for each 
k
k:

- for 
k
=
1
k=1: 
gcd
⁡
(
12
,
1
)
=
1
gcd(12,1)=1, so 
m
=
12
/
1
=
12
m=12/1=12

- for 
k
=
5
k=5: 
gcd
⁡
(
12
,
5
)
=
1
gcd(12,5)=1, so 
m
=
12
/
1
=
12
m=12/1=12

- for 
k
=
7
k=7: 
gcd
⁡
(
12
,
7
)
=
1
gcd(12,7)=1, so 
m
=
12
/
1
=
12
m=12/1=12

- for 
k
=
11
k=11: 
gcd
⁡
(
12
,
11
)
=
1
gcd(12,11)=1, so 
m
=
12
/
1
=
12
m=12/1=12

so, each root has order 12. but wait, is that correct? let me think again.

actually, the order of a root is the smallest positive integer 
m
m such that 
z
m
=
1
z 
m
 =1. for 
z
=
e
i
π
/
6
z=e 
iπ/6
 , we have 
z
12
=
e
i
2
π
=
1
z 
12
 =e 
i2π
 =1, and there is no smaller positive integer 
m
m for which this holds because 
π
/
6
π/6 times 
m
m must be a multiple of 
2
π
2π, which only happens when 
m
=
12
m=12, as 
π
/
6
×
12
=
2
π
π/6×12=2π.

similarly, for 
z
=
e
i
5
π
/
6
z=e 
i5π/6
 , 
z
12
=
e
i
10
π
=
e
i
π
=
−
1
z 
12
 =e 
i10π
 =e 
iπ
 =−1, wait, that's not 1. did i miscalculate?

wait, 
e
i
5
π
/
6
×
12
=
e
i
10
π
=
e
i
0
=
1
e 
i5π/6×12
 =e 
i10π
 =e 
i0
 =1, since 
e
i
2
π
k
=
1
e 
i2πk
 =1 for any integer 
k
k, and 
10
π
=
5
×
2
π
10π=5×2π.

wait, no, 
e
i
10
π
=
e
i
0
=
1
e 
i10π
 =e 
i0
 =1, because 
e
i
2
π
k
=
1
e 
i2πk
 =1 for integer 
k
k.

wait, but 
10
π
=
5
×
2
π
10π=5×2π, so yes, 
e
i
10
π
=
1
e 
i10π
 =1.

but is 12 the smallest such 
m
m for this root?

let's check smaller 
m
m. for 
m
=
6
m=6, 
z
6
=
e
i
5
π
/
6
×
6
=
e
i
5
π
=
−
1
z 
6
 =e 
i5π/6×6
 =e 
i5π
 =−1, not 1.

for 
m
=
12
m=12, 
z
12
=
e
i
5
π
/
6
×
12
=
e
i
10
π
=
1
z 
12
 =e 
i5π/6×12
 =e 
i10π
 =1.

so, yes, the order is 12.

similarly, for 
z
=
e
i
7
π
/
6
z=e 
i7π/6
 :

z
12
=
e
i
7
π
/
6
×
12
=
e
i
14
π
=
e
i
0
=
1
z 
12
 =e 
i7π/6×12
 =e 
i14π
 =e 
i0
 =1

and for smaller 
m
m, like 
m
=
6
m=6, 
z
6
=
e
i
7
π
/
6
×
6
=
e
i
7
π
=
−
1
z 
6
 =e 
i7π/6×6
 =e 
i7π
 =−1, not 1.

so, order is 12.

same for 
z
=
e
i
11
π
/
6
z=e 
i11π/6
 :

z
12
=
e
i
11
π
/
6
×
12
=
e
i
22
π
=
e
i
0
=
1
z 
12
 =e 
i11π/6×12
 =e 
i22π
 =e 
i0
 =1

and for 
m
=
6
m=6, 
z
6
=
e
i
11
π
/
6
×
6
=
e
i
11
π
=
−
1
z 
6
 =e 
i11π/6×6
 =e 
i11π
 =−1, not 1.

so, order is 12 for all roots.

therefore, the smallest 
n
n such that all roots are 
n
th
n 
th
  roots of unity is the least common multiple of the orders of all the roots, which in this case is lcm(12,12,12,12) = 12.

but wait, is there a smaller 
n
n that works? for example, if all roots have order dividing some smaller 
n
n, then that 
n
n would work.

but since all roots have order 12, and 12 is the smallest integer that is a multiple of their orders, i think 
n
=
12
n=12 is indeed the smallest such integer.

alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to see this. maybe by considering the original equation.

let me see. the equation is 
z
4
−
z
2
+
1
=
0
z 
4
 −z 
2
 +1=0. i can try to relate this to the cyclotomic polynomials, which are minimal polynomials for primitive 
n
th
n 
th
  roots of unity.

i know that the cyclotomic polynomial 
ϕ
n
(
z
)
ϕ 
n
​	
 (z) is the minimal polynomial over the rationals for a primitive 
n
th
n 
th
  root of unity.

so, if all roots of 
z
4
−
z
2
+
1
=
0
z 
4
 −z 
2
 +1=0 are 
n
th
n 
th
  roots of unity, and assuming they are primitive, then 
z
4
−
z
2
+
1
z 
4
 −z 
2
 +1 should divide 
ϕ
n
(
z
)
ϕ 
n
​	
 (z).

but maybe that's complicating things.

alternatively, since all roots are 12th roots of unity, and 
n
n must be a multiple of 12, the smallest such 
n
n is 12.

wait, but maybe i should check if there is a smaller 
n
n where all these roots are 
n
th
n 
th
  roots of unity.

for example, maybe 
n
=
24
n=24, but that's larger than 12, so 12 is smaller.

alternatively, perhaps 
n
=
6
n=6, but from earlier calculations, for 
n
=
6
n=6, 
z
6
z 
6
  is not equal to 1 for these roots.

wait, no, earlier i saw that for 
n
=
6
n=6, 
z
6
=
−
1
z 
6
 =−1, which is not 1, so 
n
=
6
n=6 doesn't work.

similarly, 
n
=
4
n=4, 
z
4
z 
4
  is not necessarily 1 for these roots.

wait, from the original equation 
z
4
−
z
2
+
1
=
0
z 
4
 −z 
2
 +1=0, solving for 
z
4
z 
4
 , we get 
z
4
=
z
2
−
1
z 
4
 =z 
2
 −1, which is not equal to 1 unless 
z
2
=
2
z 
2
 =2, which isn't the case for roots of unity.

so, 
n
=
4
n=4 doesn't work.

similarly, 
n
=
3
n=3, 
n
=
2
n=2, or 
n
=
1
n=1 are even smaller, but clearly, 
n
=
1
n=1 only works for 
z
=
1
z=1, which is not the case here.

therefore, the smallest 
n
n is 12.

wait, but i recall that sometimes roots can have orders that are divisors of 
n
n, so perhaps there's a way to find a smaller 
n
n that accommodates all orders.

but in this case, since all roots have order 12, the lcm is 12, and there is no smaller 
n
n that is a multiple of 12 and accommodates all roots.

wait, but actually, 12 is already the smallest such 
n
n. if 
n
n were smaller than 12, say 6, but as we saw, 
z
6
=
−
1
≠
1
z 
6
 =−1

=1, so 6 doesn't work.

alternatively, perhaps 
n
=
24
n=24, but that's larger than 12, so 12 is still smaller.

therefore, i think the answer is 
n
=
12
n=12.

**final answer**

12
