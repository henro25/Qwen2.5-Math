Problem: I had been planning to work for 20 hours a week for 12 weeks this summer to earn $\$3000$ to buy a used car. Unfortunately, I got sick for the first two weeks of the summer and didn't work any hours. How many hours a week will I have to work for the rest of the summer if I still want to buy the car?
