Reasoning: So i have this problem: "a palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward. how many three-digit perfect squares are palindromes?" okay, let's break this down.

first off, i need to find three-digit perfect squares that are also palindromes. so, a three-digit number is from 100 to 999, and a perfect square is a number that's the square of an integer. and a palindrome is the same forwards and backwards, like 121 or 131.

alright, so first, i need to figure out what the range of integers is whose squares are three-digit numbers. so, the smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest is 999.

let me find the square roots of these to know the range of integers to consider.

the square root of 100 is 10, and the square root of 999 is approximately 31.6. so, the integers i need to consider are from 10 to 31, since 10 squared is 100 and 31 squared is 961, which is still a three-digit number. 32 squared is 1024, which is a four-digit number, so i stop at 31.

now, i need to find which of the squares of these integers are palindromes.

a palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards, so for a three-digit number, the first and the last digits must be the same.

so, for a number abc, where a, b, and c are digits, it's a palindrome if a = c.

alright, so i need to find all n from 10 to 31 such that n squared is a three-digit palindrome.

let me list out the squares of these numbers and check for palindromes.

starting with 10:

10^2 = 100 → 100. is this a palindrome? well, 100 reversed is 001, which is 1, but that's not equal to 100, so no.

next, 11^2 = 121. 121 reversed is 121, so yes, it's a palindrome.

12^2 = 144. reversed is 441, not equal to 144.

13^2 = 169. reversed is 961, not equal to 169.

14^2 = 196. reversed is 691, not equal to 196.

15^2 = 225. reversed is 522, not equal to 225.

16^2 = 256. reversed is 652, not equal to 256.

17^2 = 289. reversed is 982, not equal to 289.

18^2 = 324. reversed is 423, not equal to 324.

19^2 = 361. reversed is 163, not equal to 361.

20^2 = 400. reversed is 004, which is 4, not equal to 400.

21^2 = 441. reversed is 144, not equal to 441.

22^2 = 484. reversed is 484, so yes, it's a palindrome.

23^2 = 529. reversed is 925, not equal to 529.

24^2 = 576. reversed is 675, not equal to 576.

25^2 = 625. reversed is 526, not equal to 625.

26^2 = 676. reversed is 676, so yes, it's a palindrome.

27^2 = 729. reversed is 927, not equal to 729.

28^2 = 784. reversed is 487, not equal to 784.

29^2 = 841. reversed is 148, not equal to 841.

30^2 = 900. reversed is 009, which is 9, not equal to 900.

31^2 = 961. reversed is 169, not equal to 961.

okay, so from this list, the squares that are palindromes are:

11^2 = 121

22^2 = 484

26^2 = 676

so, that's three numbers.

wait a minute, is there another one that i might have missed?

let me double-check.

10^2 = 100 → not a palindrome.

11^2 = 121 → palindrome.

12^2 = 144 → not.

13^2 = 169 → not.

14^2 = 196 → not.

15^2 = 225 → not.

16^2 = 256 → not.

17^2 = 289 → not.

18^2 = 324 → not.

19^2 = 361 → not.

20^2 = 400 → not.

21^2 = 441 → not.

22^2 = 484 → palindrome.

23^2 = 529 → not.

24^2 = 576 → not.

25^2 = 625 → not.

26^2 = 676 → palindrome.

27^2 = 729 → not.

28^2 = 784 → not.

29^2 = 841 → not.

30^2 = 900 → not.

31^2 = 961 → not.

yeah, only three numbers: 121, 484, and 676.

is there a smarter way to do this without listing all the squares?

maybe, but for a problem like this, since the range is small, listing them out seems efficient enough.

alternatively, perhaps there's a formula or pattern for three-digit palindromic squares.

let's think about the structure of a three-digit palindrome. it has the form aba, where a and b are digits, and a ≠ 0.

so, the number can be expressed as 100*a + 10*b + a = 101*a + 10*b.

now, this number is a perfect square, so 101*a + 10*b = n^2, where n is an integer between 10 and 31.

hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe i can consider the possible values of a and b.

since a can be from 1 to 9, and b from 0 to 9.

so, possible palindromic numbers are 101, 111, 121, ..., up to 999.

wait, no, actually, three-digit palindromes are 101, 111, 121, 131, ..., 999, stepping by 11 in the first and last digits.

but i need to find which of these are perfect squares.

from my earlier list, only 121, 484, and 676 are perfect squares.

is there a way to generalize this?

let me think about the possible values of n.

n is from 10 to 31.

i can consider that n must be such that n^2 is a palindrome.

alternatively, perhaps considering that n^2 is a palindrome, and n is an integer from 10 to 31.

from my earlier enumeration, there are only three such numbers.

alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical property that can help me find the number of such palindromic squares without listing them all.

for example, maybe considering the properties of squares modulo some number, but that might be overkill for this problem.

given that the range is small, and i've already listed them, i think three is the correct answer.

wait, but let me check one more thing.

is there a way to see if there are any more palindromic squares in this range?

well, 26^2 = 676 is a palindrome.

is there a pattern here?

let me see:

11^2 = 121

22^2 = 484

26^2 = 676

is there a relationship between these numbers?

11, 22, 26.

not sure, but maybe not necessary.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that for a three-digit palindrome aba, it's equal to n^2.

so, 101*a + 10*b = n^2.

but that seems complicated to solve directly.

alternatively, maybe express n in terms of a and b.

but, honestly, for this problem, listing them out seems the most straightforward approach.

therefore, the answer should be three.
