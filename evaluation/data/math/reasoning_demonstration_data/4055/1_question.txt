Problem: An element is randomly chosen from among the first $15$ rows of Pascal's Triangle. What is the probability that the value of the element chosen is $1$?

Note:  The 1 at the top is often labelled the "zeroth" row of Pascal's Triangle, by convention. So to count a total of 15 rows, use rows 0 through 14.
