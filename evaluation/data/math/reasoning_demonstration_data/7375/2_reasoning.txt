Reasoning: So i've got this problem: i need to express the square root of 
53
+
20
7
53+20 
7
​	
  in the form 
a
+
b
c
a+b 
c
​	
 , where 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c are integers, and 
c
c has no perfect square factors other than 1. then, i need to find the sum 
a
+
b
+
c
a+b+c.

okay, first things first, i need to understand what this expression means. so, i have 
53
+
20
7
53+20 
7
​	
 
​	
 , and i want to write it as 
a
+
b
c
a+b 
c
​	
 . that means if i square 
a
+
b
c
a+b 
c
​	
 , i should get back to 
53
+
20
7
53+20 
7
​	
 .

so, let's set that up:

(
a
+
b
c
)
2
=
53
+
20
7
(a+b 
c
​	
 ) 
2
 =53+20 
7
​	
 
now, let's expand the left side:

a
2
+
2
a
b
c
+
b
2
c
=
53
+
20
7
a 
2
 +2ab 
c
​	
 +b 
2
 c=53+20 
7
​	
 
hmm, so i have an expression with a rational part and an irrational part. for these two expressions to be equal, their corresponding parts must be equal. that means:

1. the rational parts are equal:

a
2
+
b
2
c
=
53
a 
2
 +b 
2
 c=53
2. the coefficients of the square roots are equal:

2
a
b
c
=
20
7
2ab 
c
​	
 =20 
7
​	
 
wait, but in the second equation, i have 
c
c
​	
  on the left and 
7
7
​	
  on the right. that suggests that 
c
c should be 7, right? because otherwise, the square roots wouldn't match.

so, let's assume 
c
=
7
c=7. then, the second equation becomes:

2
a
b
7
=
20
7
2ab 
7
​	
 =20 
7
​	
 
if i divide both sides by 
7
7
​	
 , i get:

2
a
b
=
20
2ab=20
so, 
a
b
=
10
ab=10.

alright, now i have two equations:

1. 
a
2
+
b
2
×
7
=
53
a 
2
 +b 
2
 ×7=53

2. 
a
b
=
10
ab=10

now, i need to find integer values for 
a
a and 
b
b that satisfy both equations.

let's see, since 
a
b
=
10
ab=10, possible integer pairs for 
(
a
,
b
)
(a,b) are:

- 
(
1
,
10
)
(1,10)

- 
(
2
,
5
)
(2,5)

- 
(
5
,
2
)
(5,2)

- 
(
10
,
1
)
(10,1)

- and their negative counterparts: 
(
−
1
,
−
10
)
(−1,−10), 
(
−
2
,
−
5
)
(−2,−5), etc.

i'll start with 
(
a
,
b
)
=
(
2
,
5
)
(a,b)=(2,5).

plugging into the first equation:

2
2
+
5
2
×
7
=
4
+
25
×
7
=
4
+
175
=
179
≠
53
2 
2
 +5 
2
 ×7=4+25×7=4+175=179

=53
that's not equal to 53. hmm.

next, 
(
a
,
b
)
=
(
5
,
2
)
(a,b)=(5,2):

5
2
+
2
2
×
7
=
25
+
4
×
7
=
25
+
28
=
53
5 
2
 +2 
2
 ×7=25+4×7=25+28=53
hey, that works!

so, 
a
=
5
a=5 and 
b
=
2
b=2, with 
c
=
7
c=7.

therefore, 
53
+
20
7
=
5
+
2
7
53+20 
7
​	
 
​	
 =5+2 
7
​	
 .

now, the problem asks for 
a
+
b
+
c
a+b+c, which is 
5
+
2
+
7
=
14
5+2+7=14.

but wait, just to make sure, let's check if there are other possible pairs that might work.

let's try 
(
a
,
b
)
=
(
1
,
10
)
(a,b)=(1,10):

1
2
+
1
0
2
×
7
=
1
+
100
×
7
=
1
+
700
=
701
≠
53
1 
2
 +10 
2
 ×7=1+100×7=1+700=701

=53
nope.

next, 
(
a
,
b
)
=
(
10
,
1
)
(a,b)=(10,1):

1
0
2
+
1
2
×
7
=
100
+
1
×
7
=
100
+
7
=
107
≠
53
10 
2
 +1 
2
 ×7=100+1×7=100+7=107

=53
not equal.

how about negative values? let's try 
(
a
,
b
)
=
(
−
5
,
−
2
)
(a,b)=(−5,−2):

(
−
5
)
2
+
(
−
2
)
2
×
7
=
25
+
4
×
7
=
25
+
28
=
53
(−5) 
2
 +(−2) 
2
 ×7=25+4×7=25+28=53
that also works.

so, 
a
=
−
5
a=−5 and 
b
=
−
2
b=−2, with 
c
=
7
c=7.

then, 
a
+
b
+
c
=
−
5
+
(
−
2
)
+
7
=
0
a+b+c=−5+(−2)+7=0.

but the problem probably expects positive integers for 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c, given the context, so i'll stick with the positive values.

just to be thorough, let's check 
(
a
,
b
)
=
(
−
2
,
−
5
)
(a,b)=(−2,−5):

(
−
2
)
2
+
(
−
5
)
2
×
7
=
4
+
25
×
7
=
4
+
175
=
179
≠
53
(−2) 
2
 +(−5) 
2
 ×7=4+25×7=4+175=179

=53
nope.

and 
(
a
,
b
)
=
(
−
1
,
−
10
)
(a,b)=(−1,−10):

(
−
1
)
2
+
(
−
10
)
2
×
7
=
1
+
100
×
7
=
1
+
700
=
701
≠
53
(−1) 
2
 +(−10) 
2
 ×7=1+100×7=1+700=701

=53
also no.

so, the only pairs that work are 
(
5
,
2
)
(5,2) and 
(
−
5
,
−
2
)
(−5,−2), both leading to 
c
=
7
c=7.

given that, and assuming positive integers, the sum is 
5
+
2
+
7
=
14
5+2+7=14.

therefore, the answer should be 
14
14
​	
 .

**final answer**

14
