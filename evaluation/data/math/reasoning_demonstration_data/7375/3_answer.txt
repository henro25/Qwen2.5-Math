Answer: To express \(\sqrt{53 + 20\sqrt{7}}\) in the form \(a + b\sqrt{c}\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are integers and \(c\) has no perfect square factors other than 1, we start by setting up the equation:

\[
(a + b\sqrt{c})^2 = 53 + 20\sqrt{7}
\]

expanding and equating the rational and irrational parts, we get:

\[
a^2 + b^2 c = 53 \quad \text{and} \quad 2ab\sqrt{c} = 20\sqrt{7}
\]

from the second equation, we deduce \(c = 7\) and \(2ab = 20\), which simplifies to \(ab = 10\).

now, we solve the system of equations:

1. \(a^2 + 7b^2 = 53\)
2. \(ab = 10\)

possible integer pairs for \((a, b)\) that satisfy \(ab = 10\) are \((1, 10)\), \((2, 5)\), \((5, 2)\), \((10, 1)\), and their negative counterparts. testing these pairs:

- for \((a, b) = (2, 5)\):
  \[
  2^2 + 5^2 \times 7 = 4 + 175 = 179 \neq 53
  \]

- for \((a, b) = (5, 2)\):
  \[
  5^2 + 2^2 \times 7 = 25 + 28 = 53
  \]

this pair works, so \(a = 5\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = 7\). therefore, \(\sqrt{53 + 20\sqrt{7}} = 5 + 2\sqrt{7}\).

the sum \(a + b + c\) is:

\[
5 + 2 + 7 = 14
\]

thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{14}
\]
