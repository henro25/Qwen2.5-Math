Problem: Let $S$ be the set of complex numbers of the form $x + yi,$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, such that
\[\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \le x \le \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.\]Find the smallest positive integer $m$ such that for all positive integers $n \ge m,$ there exists a complex number $z \in S$ such that $z^n = 1.$
