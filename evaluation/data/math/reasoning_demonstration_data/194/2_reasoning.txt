Reasoning: Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There are three numbers, a, b, and c, and their sum is 60. So, a + b + c = 60. Got that.

Now, there's this value N involved. It says if we decrease a by 7, we get N. So, a - 7 = N. Also, if we increase b by 7, we get N. So, b + 7 = N. And if we multiply c by 7, we also get N. So, 7c = N.

Alright, so I have three equations:

1. a + b + c = 60

2. a - 7 = N

3. b + 7 = N

4. 7c = N

I need to find the value of N.

Hmm, maybe I can express a, b, and c in terms of N and then substitute back into the first equation.

From equation 2, a = N + 7.

From equation 3, b = N - 7.

From equation 4, c = N / 7.

So, plugging these into the first equation:

(N + 7) + (N - 7) + (N / 7) = 60.

Simplify that:

N + 7 + N - 7 + N/7 = 60.

The +7 and -7 cancel out, so:

2N + N/7 = 60.

Hmm, combining like terms. To add 2N and N/7, I need a common denominator.

2N is the same as 14N/7, so:

14N/7 + N/7 = 60.

That's 15N/7 = 60.

So, to solve for N, multiply both sides by 7:

15N = 420.

Then, divide both sides by 15:

N = 28.

Wait, does that make sense? Let's check.

If N is 28, then:

a = 28 + 7 = 35.

b = 28 - 7 = 21.

c = 28 / 7 = 4.

Now, a + b + c = 35 + 21 + 4 = 60, which matches the first condition.

And:

a - 7 = 35 - 7 = 28 = N.

b + 7 = 21 + 7 = 28 = N.

7c = 7 * 4 = 28 = N.

Looks good!
