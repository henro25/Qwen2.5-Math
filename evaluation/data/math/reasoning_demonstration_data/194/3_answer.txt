Answer: Given the conditions:

1. \( a + b + c = 60 \)
2. \( a - 7 = N \)
3. \( b + 7 = N \)
4. \( 7c = N \)

We express \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) in terms of \( N \):

\[
a = N + 7, \quad b = N - 7, \quad c = \frac{N}{7}
\]

Substituting these into the first equation:

\[
(N + 7) + (N - 7) + \frac{N}{7} = 60
\]

Simplifying:

\[
2N + \frac{N}{7} = 60
\]

Combining terms:

\[
\frac{14N}{7} + \frac{N}{7} = 60 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{15N}{7} = 60
\]

Multiplying both sides by 7:

\[
15N = 420
\]

Solving for \( N \):

\[
N = \frac{420}{15} = 28
\]

Finally, verifying:

\[
a = 28 + 7 = 35, \quad b = 28 - 7 = 21, \quad c = \frac{28}{7} = 4
\]
\[
a + b + c = 35 + 21 + 4 = 60
\]

All conditions are satisfied, so the value of \( N \) is **28**.
