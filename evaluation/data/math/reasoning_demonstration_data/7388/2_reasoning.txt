Reasoning: Let's tackle this probability problem. so, we have a rectangle with vertices at (0,0), (2,0), (2,1), and (0,1). we need to find the probability that a randomly selected point p within this rectangle is closer to the origin (0,0) than to the point (3,1).

first, i need to understand what it means for a point to be closer to one point than another. the distance from p(x,y) to the origin is given by the distance formula:

d
1
=
(
x
−
0
)
2
+
(
y
−
0
)
2
=
x
2
+
y
2
d 
1
​	
 = 
(x−0) 
2
 +(y−0) 
2
 
​	
 = 
x 
2
 +y 
2
 
​	
 
similarly, the distance from p(x,y) to (3,1) is:

d
2
=
(
x
−
3
)
2
+
(
y
−
1
)
2
d 
2
​	
 = 
(x−3) 
2
 +(y−1) 
2
 
​	
 
we want the set of points where 
d
1
<
d
2
d 
1
​	
 <d 
2
​	
 .

so, we can set up the inequality:

x
2
+
y
2
<
(
x
−
3
)
2
+
(
y
−
1
)
2
x 
2
 +y 
2
 
​	
 < 
(x−3) 
2
 +(y−1) 
2
 
​	
 
to eliminate the square roots, i'll square both sides:

x
2
+
y
2
<
(
x
−
3
)
2
+
(
y
−
1
)
2
x 
2
 +y 
2
 <(x−3) 
2
 +(y−1) 
2
 
expanding the right side:

x
2
+
y
2
<
x
2
−
6
x
+
9
+
y
2
−
2
y
+
1
x 
2
 +y 
2
 <x 
2
 −6x+9+y 
2
 −2y+1
simplifying:

x
2
+
y
2
<
x
2
−
6
x
+
9
+
y
2
−
2
y
+
1
x 
2
 +y 
2
 <x 
2
 −6x+9+y 
2
 −2y+1
subtract 
x
2
+
y
2
x 
2
 +y 
2
  from both sides:

0
<
−
6
x
+
10
−
2
y
0<−6x+10−2y
rearranging terms:

6
x
+
2
y
<
10
6x+2y<10
dividing both sides by 2:

3
x
+
y
<
5
3x+y<5
so, the region where points are closer to the origin than to (3,1) is defined by the inequality 
3
x
+
y
<
5
3x+y<5.

now, i need to find the area within the rectangle where 
3
x
+
y
<
5
3x+y<5, and then divide that by the total area of the rectangle to get the probability.

first, let's find the total area of the rectangle. the rectangle has a width of 2 units (from x=0 to x=2) and a height of 1 unit (from y=0 to y=1), so:

total area
=
2
×
1
=
2
total area=2×1=2
next, let's find the area where 
3
x
+
y
<
5
3x+y<5. to do this, i can graph the line 
3
x
+
y
=
5
3x+y=5 and see how it intersects the rectangle.

let's find the points of intersection of the line 
3
x
+
y
=
5
3x+y=5 with the sides of the rectangle.

first, intersection with the bottom side of the rectangle (y=0):

3
x
+
0
=
5
  
⟹
  
x
=
5
3
3x+0=5⟹x= 
3
5
​	
 
but x ranges from 0 to 2, and 
5
3
≈
1.6667
3
5
​	
 ≈1.6667, which is within the rectangle.

second, intersection with the top side of the rectangle (y=1):

3
x
+
1
=
5
  
⟹
  
3
x
=
4
  
⟹
  
x
=
4
3
3x+1=5⟹3x=4⟹x= 
3
4
​	
 
again, 
4
3
≈
1.3333
3
4
​	
 ≈1.3333, which is within the rectangle.

third, intersection with the left side of the rectangle (x=0):

3
(
0
)
+
y
=
5
  
⟹
  
y
=
5
3(0)+y=5⟹y=5
but y only goes up to 1, so no intersection here within the rectangle.

fourth, intersection with the right side of the rectangle (x=2):

3
(
2
)
+
y
=
5
  
⟹
  
6
+
y
=
5
  
⟹
  
y
=
−
1
3(2)+y=5⟹6+y=5⟹y=−1
again, y cannot be negative in the rectangle, so no intersection here within the rectangle.

so, the line intersects the bottom side at 
x
=
5
3
x= 
3
5
​	
  and the top side at 
x
=
4
3
x= 
3
4
​	
 .

now, to find the area where 
3
x
+
y
<
5
3x+y<5, we can consider the region below the line within the rectangle.

the area below the line in the rectangle can be found by integrating or by finding the area of the polygon defined by the intersection points.

alternatively, since the rectangle is bounded between x=0 and x=2, and y=0 and y=1, and the line intersects the rectangle at two points, i can split the area into regions where the inequality holds.

let's consider the region where 
y
<
5
−
3
x
y<5−3x, within the rectangle.

since y can't exceed 1, and x ranges from 0 to 2, i need to consider where 
5
−
3
x
5−3x is above y=0 and y=1.

let's see:

for x from 0 to 
5
3
3
5
​	
 , 
5
−
3
x
5−3x is greater than y=1.

at x=0, 
5
−
0
=
5
5−0=5, which is above y=1.

at x= 
5
3
3
5
​	
 , 
5
−
3
(
5
3
)
=
5
−
5
=
0
5−3( 
3
5
​	
 )=5−5=0, which is y=0.

similarly, for x from 
4
3
3
4
​	
  to 2, 
5
−
3
x
5−3x is below y=1.

wait, let's clarify.

actually, since y cannot exceed 1, and 
5
−
3
x
5−3x is the boundary, we need to consider the minimum of 
5
−
3
x
5−3x and y=1.

but let's plot the line to visualize.

at x=0, y=5, but y=5 is outside the rectangle.

at x= 
5
3
3
5
​	
 , y=0.

at x= 
4
3
3
4
​	
 , y=1.

so, the line crosses the bottom side at 
(
5
3
,
0
)
( 
3
5
​	
 ,0) and the top side at 
(
4
3
,
1
)
( 
3
4
​	
 ,1).

therefore, the area where 
3
x
+
y
<
5
3x+y<5 within the rectangle is a quadrilateral with vertices at (0,0), (0,1), 
(
4
3
,
1
)
( 
3
4
​	
 ,1), and 
(
5
3
,
0
)
( 
3
5
​	
 ,0).

wait, let's see.

actually, the region where 
3
x
+
y
<
5
3x+y<5 is below the line 
3
x
+
y
=
5
3x+y=5.

so, within the rectangle, this region would be bounded by the line from 
(
5
3
,
0
)
( 
3
5
​	
 ,0) to 
(
4
3
,
1
)
( 
3
4
​	
 ,1), and the sides of the rectangle.

so, the area can be found by calculating the area of the trapezoid formed by these points.

alternatively, it's easier to calculate the area where 
3
x
+
y
<
5
3x+y<5 and subtract from the total area if needed.

let me try to set up the integral for the area.

we can integrate with respect to x from 0 to 2, and for each x, y goes from 0 to the minimum of 1 and 
5
−
3
x
5−3x.

so:

area
=
∫
0
2
min
⁡
(
1
,
5
−
3
x
)
 
d
x
area=∫ 
0
2
​	
 min(1,5−3x)dx
we need to find where 
5
−
3
x
=
1
5−3x=1, to split the integral.

set 
5
−
3
x
=
1
5−3x=1:

5
−
3
x
=
1
  
⟹
  
3
x
=
4
  
⟹
  
x
=
4
3
5−3x=1⟹3x=4⟹x= 
3
4
​	
 
so, for x from 0 to 
4
3
3
4
​	
 , 
5
−
3
x
5−3x is greater than 1, so y goes from 0 to 1.

for x from 
4
3
3
4
​	
  to 2, 
5
−
3
x
5−3x is less than 1, so y goes from 0 to 
5
−
3
x
5−3x.

therefore, the area is:

so, the second integral is 
4
−

=

4−4=0.

wait, that can't be right. if i plug in x=2 and x=4/3, both give 4, so the integral would be 0, which doesn't make sense.

i must have made a mistake in calculating the integral.

let me recalculate the second integral.

so, indeed, both evaluations give 4, and the integral is 4 - 4 = 0.

but this doesn't make sense because there should be some area under the curve from x=4/3 to x=2.

wait, maybe i set up the integral incorrectly.

let me check the limits again.

we have 
5
−
3
x
5−3x from x=4/3 to x=2.

at x=4/3, 
5
−
3
(
4
3
)
=
5
−
4
=
1
5−3( 
3
4
​	
 )=5−4=1

at x=2, 
5
−
3
(
2
)
=
5
−
6
=
−
1
5−3(2)=5−6=−1

but y cannot be negative, so y goes from 0 to the minimum of 
5
−
3
x
5−3x and 1.

but at x=4/3, 
5
−
3
x
=
1
5−3x=1, and at x=2, 
5
−
3
x
=
−
1
5−3x=−1, but since y can't be negative, y goes from 0 to 
5
−
3
x
5−3x only if 
5
−
3
x
>
0
5−3x>0, which is up to x=5/3.

wait, at x=5/3, 
5
−
3
x
=
0
5−3x=0

so, actually, from x=4/3 to x=5/3, 
5
−
3
x
5−3x is between 1 and 0.

and from x=5/3 to x=2, 
5
−
3
x
5−3x is negative, so y can't be negative, so y=0.

so, perhaps i need to split the integral further.

first, from x=0 to x=4/3, y goes from 0 to 1.

from x=4/3 to x=5/3, y goes from 0 to 
5
−
3
x
5−3x.

from x=5/3 to x=2, y goes from 0 to 0, which is nothing.

so, the area is:

therefore, the total area where

now, the total area of the rectangle is 2, as calculated earlier.

so, the probability that a randomly selected point p is closer to the origin than to (3,1) is:

wait, that doesn't seem right because

  divided by 2 is

​	
 , but intuitively, i feel like the area should be less than the total area.

but let me double-check the calculations.

first, the integral from 0 to 4/3 of 1 dx is indeed 4/3.

second, the integral from 4/3 to 5/3 of (5 - 3x) dx is 1/6.

adding them gives 4/3 + 1/6 = 9/6 = 3/2, which is correct.

total area is 2, so probability is (3/2)/2 = 3/4.

but let's visualize this.

the rectangle is from x=0 to x=2 and y=0 to y=1.

the line 
3
x
+
y
=
5
3x+y=5 intersects the bottom at x=5/3 and the top at x=4/3.

so, the region where 
3
x
+
y
<
5
3x+y<5 is the area below this line.

from x=0 to x=4/3, y can be up to 1.

from x=4/3 to x=5/3, y goes from 0 to 
5
−
3
x
5−3x.

from x=5/3 to x=2, y=0.

so, the area calculation seems correct.

therefore, the probability is 3/4.

but i have a feeling that this might not be the correct approach because the region defined by 
3
x
+
y
<
5
3x+y<5 within the rectangle might not fully capture all points closer to the origin.

alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this problem using geometric probability.

let me consider the perpendicular bisector between the origin and (3,1).

the set of points equidistant to (0,0) and (3,1) lies on the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining these two points.

the midpoint between (0,0) and (3,1) is 
(
3
2
,
1
2
)
( 
2
3
​	
 , 
2
1
​	
 ).

the slope of the line segment from (0,0) to (3,1) is 
1
−
0
3
−
0
=
1
3
3−0
1−0
​	
 = 
3

​	
 .

therefore, the slope of the perpendicular bisector is the negative reciprocal, which is -3.

so, the equation of the perpendicular bisector is:

y

3
(
x
−
3

)
y−

​	
 =−3(x−

​	
 )
simplifying:

y

x

5
y=−3x+5
wait a minute, this is the same as 
3
x
+
y
=
5
3x+y=5, which matches our earlier inequality.

so, the region where points are closer to the origin is indeed below the line 
3
x
+
y
=
5
3x+y=5.

therefore, the area calculation should be correct.

thus, the probability is 
3
4

3
​	
 .

but earlier, i thought that might be too high, but given the calculations, it seems accurate.

alternatively, perhaps i can check by considering the area of the rectangle and the area where the inequality holds.

total area is 2.

calculated area where 
3
x
+
y
<
5
3x+y<5 is 3/2, which is 1.5, and 1.5 divided by 2 is indeed 0.75 or 3/4.

so, the probability is 3/4.
