Answer: Given the points \( f_1 = (0,1) \) and \( f_2 = (4,1) \), we need to find the set of points \( p \) such that \( pf_1 + pf_2 = 6 \), which forms an ellipse. the standard form of the ellipse equation is:

\[
\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1
\]

first, we find the center of the ellipse, which is the midpoint of \( f_1 \) and \( f_2 \):

\[
h = \frac{0 + 4}{2} = 2, \quad k = \frac{1 + 1}{2} = 1
\]

so, the center is at \( (2,1) \).

next, we determine \( a \) and \( b \). the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the foci is \( 2a \):

\[
2a = 6 \implies a = 3
\]

the distance \( c \) from the center to each focus is:

\[
c = \sqrt{(2 - 0)^2 + (1 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{4} = 2
\]

using the relationship \( c^2 = a^2 - b^2 \):

\[
2^2 = 3^2 - b^2 \implies 4 = 9 - b^2 \implies b^2 = 5 \implies b = \sqrt{5}
\]

thus, the equation of the ellipse is:

\[
\frac{(x - 2)^2}{9} + \frac{(y - 1)^2}{5} = 1
\]

finally, we find \( h + k + a + b \):

\[
h + k + a + b = 2 + 1 + 3 + \sqrt{5} = 6 + \sqrt{5}
\]

therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{6 + \sqrt{5}}
\]
