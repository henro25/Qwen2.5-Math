Reasoning: Let's tackle this problem step by step. so, we have two points, f₁ = (0,1) and f₂ = (4,1), and we're looking at all points p such that the sum of the distances from p to f₁ and p to f₂ is 6. that's the definition of an ellipse, where f₁ and f₂ are the foci of the ellipse. cool.

first, i need to recall the standard equation of an ellipse. it's usually given in the form:

(
x
−
h
)
2
a
2
+
(
y
−
k
)
2
b
2
=
1
a 
2
 
(x−h) 
2
 
​	
 + 
b 
2
 
(y−k) 
2
 
​	
 =1
where (h,k) is the center of the ellipse, a is the semi-major axis, and b is the semi-minor axis. but i need to be careful about which is which because sometimes a is associated with the horizontal axis and b with the vertical, but that depends on the orientation of the ellipse.

given that both foci have the same y-coordinate, 1, and different x-coordinates, 0 and 4, it seems like the major axis of the ellipse is horizontal. that makes sense because the foci are aligned horizontally.

first, let's find the center of the ellipse. the center is the midpoint between the two foci. so, the midpoint formula is:

h
=
0

h=

0+4
​

k
=

+

2
=
1
k= 
2
1+1
​	
 =1
so, the center of the ellipse is at (2,1). that means h = 2 and k = 1.

next, i need to find a and b. i know that for an ellipse, the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is equal to 2a. in this problem, that sum is given as 6, so:

2
a
=
6
  
⟹
  
a
=
3
2a=6⟹a=3
great, so a = 3.

now, i need to find b. to find b, i can use the relationship between a, b, and c in an ellipse, where c is the distance from the center to each focus. the relationship is:

c
2
=
a
2
−
b
2
c 
2
 =a 
2
 −b 
2
 
first, let's find c. c is the distance from the center to one of the foci. since the foci are at (0,1) and (4,1), and the center is at (2,1), the distance c is:

c
=
(
2
−
0
)
2
+
(
1
−
1
)
2
=

0
=

c= 
(2−0) 
2
 +(1−1) 
2
 
​	
 = 
4+0
​	
 =2
so, c = 2.

now, plug c and a into the equation to find b:

⟹
  
b

 −b

 ⟹4=9−b 
2
 ⟹b 
2
 =9−4=5⟹b= 
5
​	
 
alright, so b = √5.

now, putting it all together, the equation of the ellipse is:

(
x
−
2
)
2

2

(
y
−

)
2
(

⟹

​	
 =1⟹ 
9
(x−2) 
2
 
​	
 +

(y−1)

​

and the problem asks for h + k + a + b, which is:

2

2+1+3+

wait a minute, but the problem probably expects a numerical value, but since b is √5, which is irrational, maybe it wants it in terms of radicals. alternatively, maybe i missed something.

let me double-check my steps.

first, the center is correctly at (2,1).

sum of distances is 6, so 2a = 6, hence a = 3.

distance between center and focus is c = 2.

then, c² = a² - b² => 4 = 9 - b² => b² = 5 => b = √5.

that seems correct.

so, h + k + a + b = 2 + 1 + 3 + √5 = 6 + √5.

but the problem mentions "the equation of this ellipse can be written as [...] find h + k + a + b."

it doesn't specify to rationalize or to provide a numerical approximation, so probably 6 + √5 is acceptable.

alternatively, maybe i need to rationalize or express it differently, but i don't think so. √5 is already simplified.

so, the final answer should be 6 + √5.

wait, but the problem might be expecting a numerical value without radicals, but since √5 is irrational, that's not possible. so, 6 + √5 should be correct.

alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming the major axis is horizontal. let me confirm that.

given that both foci have the same y-coordinate, indeed, the major axis is horizontal, so my assumption seems correct.

alternatively, perhaps the major axis is vertical, but no, that wouldn't make sense because the foci are aligned horizontally.

wait, just to be sure, in an ellipse, if the major axis is horizontal, the foci are on the major axis, which is horizontal in this case, which matches the given foci positions.

so, my calculations seem correct.

therefore, the answer is 6 + √5.

**final answer**
