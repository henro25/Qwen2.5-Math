Reasoning: So i have this problem about dividing dummies, which are these chocolate candies, among some kids. let me try to understand what's going on here.

first, it says that every bag of dummies has the same number of pieces. let's call the number of pieces in one bag "n." so, each bag has n dummies.

now, it says that if you try to divide the dummies in one bag among 9 kids, you can't do it equally because after each kid gets the same whole number of pieces, there are 7 pieces left over. so, mathematically, this means that when n is divided by 9, the remainder is 7. in other words:

n ≡ 7 mod 9

that's the same as saying n = 9k + 7 for some integer k.

okay, now the next part of the problem says that if the dummies in three bags are divided equally among 9 kids, what's the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over?

so, if one bag has n dummies, then three bags have 3n dummies. we need to divide 3n by 9 and find the smallest possible remainder.

let's express 3n in terms of k:

3n = 3*(9k + 7) = 27k + 21

now, we need to divide 27k + 21 by 9 and find the remainder.

well, 27k is divisible by 9 because 27 is a multiple of 9 (27 ÷ 9 = 3). so, 27k ÷ 9 = 3k with no remainder.

now, 21 divided by 9 is 2 with a remainder of 3 because 9*2 = 18 and 21 - 18 = 3.

therefore, the total remainder when 3n is divided by 9 is 3.

wait a minute, is that the smallest possible remainder?

let me check if there's a way to have a smaller remainder.

we know that n ≡ 7 mod 9, so n = 9k + 7.

then, 3n = 27k + 21.

now, 27k is divisible by 9, so 27k ≡ 0 mod 9.

and 21 ≡ 3 mod 9, because 21 - 18 = 3.

therefore, 3n ≡ 3 mod 9.

so, the remainder is always 3, no matter what k is.

therefore, the smallest possible number of pieces left over is 3.

but wait, the problem is asking for the smallest possible number of pieces left over. is there a way to have a smaller remainder?

let me think differently. maybe i'm missing something.

suppose i consider the total number of dummies in three bags, which is 3n.

since n ≡ 7 mod 9, then 3n ≡ 3*7 = 21 ≡ 3 mod 9.

so, 3n ≡ 3 mod 9, meaning that when 3n is divided by 9, the remainder is 3.

is there a way to have a smaller remainder?

well, in modular arithmetic, the remainder is unique and falls between 0 and 8 in this case, since we're dividing by 9.

but in this scenario, since n is fixed to be congruent to 7 mod 9, and we're multiplying by 3, the remainder when 3n is divided by 9 is fixed at 3.

therefore, the smallest possible remainder is 3.

wait, but the problem is phrased in a way that suggests maybe there's a smaller remainder possible. maybe i need to consider that the total number of dummies in three bags could be expressed differently.

let me try plugging in some numbers to verify.

suppose n = 7 (since n ≡ 7 mod 9, the smallest possible n is 7).

then, 3n = 21.

21 divided by 9 is 2 with a remainder of 3.

so, remainder is 3.

next, n = 16 (which is 9*1 + 7).

3n = 48.

48 divided by 9 is 5 with a remainder of 3.

again, remainder is 3.

next, n = 25.

3n = 75.

75 divided by 9 is 8 with a remainder of 3.

again, remainder is 3.

it seems consistent.

wait, but is there a way to have a smaller remainder?

maybe if n is larger, but n has to be congruent to 7 mod 9.

let me try n = 7 + 9k for some integer k.

then, 3n = 21 + 27k.

now, 27k is divisible by 9, as 27 is a multiple of 9.

so, 27k ≡ 0 mod 9.

and 21 ≡ 3 mod 9.

therefore, 3n ≡ 3 mod 9, always.

so, the remainder is always 3.

therefore, the smallest possible remainder is 3.

hmm, but the problem is phrased as "what is the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over?"

does this mean that in some cases, the remainder could be less than 3?

from my calculations, it seems not.

alternatively, perhaps i need to consider that the total number of dummies in three bags is 3n, and since n ≡ 7 mod 9, then 3n ≡ 21 mod 27.

wait, but 21 mod 27 is still 21, which when divided by 9 gives a remainder of 3.

alternatively, maybe i need to consider that n could be expressed differently.

wait, maybe i need to think about the greatest common divisor or something.

let me consider that 9 divides into 3n with some remainder.

but 9 divides 3n + r, where r is the remainder, and 0 ≤ r < 9.

from earlier, r = 3.

is there a way to have r smaller than 3?

given that n ≡ 7 mod 9, and 3n ≡ 21 ≡ 3 mod 9, it seems not.

unless there's some other constraint i'm missing.

wait, the problem says "the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over."

is there a way to choose n such that when 3n is divided by 9, the remainder is smaller than 3?

wait, but n is fixed to be congruent to 7 mod 9, so n = 9k + 7.

therefore, 3n = 27k + 21.

27k is divisible by 9, and 21 divided by 9 leaves a remainder of 3.

so, regardless of k, the remainder is always 3.

therefore, the smallest possible remainder is 3.

but maybe i need to consider that in some cases, the remainder could be less if n is larger.

but from the earlier examples, it seems not.

alternatively, perhaps the problem allows for the total number of dummies in three bags to be divided among 9 kids in a different way.

wait, no, it's just dividing 3n by 9 and finding the remainder.

i think the answer is 3.

but the problem is phrased in a way that suggests maybe i need to think differently.

let me try to rephrase it.

given that n ≡ 7 mod 9, find the smallest possible remainder when 3n is divided by 9.

from above, it's 3.

alternatively, maybe i need to think about the division in terms of per kid.

if 3n is divided among 9 kids, each kid gets 3n/9 = n/3 pieces.

but n is 9k + 7, so n/3 = 3k + 7/3, which is not a whole number.

wait, but the problem says "the dummies in three bags are divided equally among 9 kids."

but if n is the number in one bag, then 3n is the total, divided by 9 kids, each gets 3n/9 = n/3.

if n is 9k + 7, then n/3 = 3k + 7/3, which is not a whole number.

so, there will be a remainder.

the total remainder is 3n mod 9, which is 3.

therefore, the smallest possible number of pieces left over is 3.

i think that's the answer.

**final answer**

the smallest possible number of pieces left over is \boxed{3}.
