Answer: To find how many miles Shari walked, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

Given:
- Speed = 3 miles per hour
- Time = 1.5 hours

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Distance} = 3 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 4.5 \, \text{miles}
\]

Since 4.5 is already to the nearest tenth, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{4.5}
\]
