Reasoning: Alright, so Shari is walking at a constant rate of 3 miles per hour. I need to figure out how far she walks after 1.5 hours. Okay, so distance is equal to speed multiplied by time, right? So, distance = speed Ã— time. Her speed is 3 miles per hour, and the time is 1.5 hours. So, I just need to multiply 3 by 1.5.

Wait, but 1.5 is the same as one and a half, or 3/2. So, 3 times 1.5. Let me think, 3 times 1 is 3, and 3 times 0.5 is 1.5. So, 3 plus 1.5 equals 4.5. So, she should have walked 4.5 miles.

But, just to make sure, let me double-check. If she walks 3 miles in one hour, then in half an hour, she would walk half of that, which is 1.5 miles. So, in one and a half hours, that's one hour plus half an hour, which is 3 miles plus 1.5 miles, totaling 4.5 miles. Yep, that matches what I got before.

I think that's the answer. It seems straightforward, but I just want to make sure I didn't miss anything. The question says to express the answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth, but since 4.5 is already to the nearest tenth, I don't need to do any rounding.

Yeah, I'm confident that Shari walked 4.5 miles after 1.5 hours.
