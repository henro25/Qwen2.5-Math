Problem: Let $O$ be the origin.  A variable plane has a distance of 1 from the origin, and intersects the $x$-axis, $y$-axis, and $z$-axis at $A,$ $B,$ and $C,$ respectively, all distinct from $O.$  Let $(p,q,r)$ be the centroid of triangle $ABC.$  Find
\[\frac{1}{p^2} + \frac{1}{q^2} + \frac{1}{r^2}.\]
