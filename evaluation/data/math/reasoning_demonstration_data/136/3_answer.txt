Answer: First, we analyze the equation:

\[
\frac{(x+a)(x+b)(x+12)}{(x+3)^2} = 0
\]

for this equation to have exactly 3 distinct roots, the roots \(x = -a\), \(x = -b\), and \(x = -12\) must be distinct and different from \(x = -3\). this gives us the conditions:

1. \(a \neq b\)
2. \(a \neq 12\)
3. \(b \neq 12\)
4. \(a \neq 3\)
5. \(b \neq 3\)

next, we analyze the second equation:

\[
\frac{(x+2a)(x+3)(x+6)}{(x+b)(x+12)} = 0
\]

for this equation to have exactly 1 distinct root, we consider the roots \(x = -2a\), \(x = -3\), and \(x = -6\), ensuring they are not excluded by the denominator. we find that:

- if \(a = 1.5\) and \(b = 6\), the roots are \(x = -3\) (double root) and \(x = -6\) (excluded), giving one distinct root.
- if \(a = 3\) and \(b = 3\), this violates \(a \neq b\).

thus, the valid solution is \(a = 1.5\) and \(b = 6\). therefore, we compute:

\[
100a + b = 100 \times 1.5 + 6 = 150 + 6 = 156
\]

\boxed{156}
