Reasoning: So i've got this equation here: 2x² + 2y² + 10x - 6y - 18 = 0. i need to find the area of the circle defined by this equation, and express it in terms of π. hmm, okay, first thing i remember is that the general equation of a circle is (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius. but this equation doesn't look like that; it's got coefficients in front of the x² and y² terms, and there are linear terms in x and y as well. so, i need to manipulate this equation to get it into the standard circle form.

first, maybe i should try to complete the square for both x and y terms. but before that, i notice that both x² and y² terms have coefficients of 2. it might be easier to divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify things. let me do that:

2x² + 2y² + 10x - 6y - 18 = 0

divide everything by 2:

x² + y² + 5x - 3y - 9 = 0

okay, that's a bit simpler. now, i need to rearrange this to complete the square for both x and y. let's group the x terms and the y terms together:

x² + 5x + y² - 3y = 9

now, to complete the square for the x terms: x² + 5x. the coefficient of x is 5, so half of that is 2.5, and squaring it gives 6.25. so, i'll add and subtract 6.25 for the x terms.

similarly, for the y terms: y² - 3y. the coefficient of y is -3, half of that is -1.5, and squaring it gives 2.25. so, i'll add and subtract 2.25 for the y terms.

let me write that out:

(x² + 5x + 6.25) - 6.25 + (y² - 3y + 2.25) - 2.25 = 9

now, the expressions in the parentheses are perfect squares:

(x + 2.5)² - 6.25 + (y - 1.5)² - 2.25 = 9

combine the constants on the left side:

(x + 2.5)² + (y - 1.5)² - 8.5 = 9

now, add 8.5 to both sides to isolate the squared terms:

(x + 2.5)² + (y - 1.5)² = 17.5

so, now the equation is in the standard form of a circle: (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where h = -2.5, k = 1.5, and r² = 17.5.

therefore, the radius r is the square root of 17.5, which is √(35/2), but maybe it's better to keep it as √17.5 for now.

the area of a circle is πr². so, plugging in r² = 17.5, the area should be π * 17.5.

but 17.5 is the same as 35/2, so the area is π * (35/2) = 35π/2.

wait a minute, let me double-check that.

original equation: 2x² + 2y² + 10x - 6y - 18 = 0

divided by 2: x² + y² + 5x - 3y - 9 = 0

moved constants: x² + 5x + y² - 3y = 9

completed the squares:

x² + 5x + (25/4) + y² - 3y + (9/4) = 9 + 25/4 + 9/4

wait, i think i messed up the constants earlier. let's recalculate the constants properly.

when completing the square, for x² + 5x, i added (5/2)² = 25/4, and for y² - 3y, i added (−3/2)² = 9/4.

so, the equation becomes:

(x² + 5x + 25/4) + (y² - 3y + 9/4) = 9 + 25/4 + 9/4

simplify the right side:

9 is 36/4, so 36/4 + 25/4 + 9/4 = (36 + 25 + 9)/4 = 70/4 = 35/2

therefore, the equation is:

(x + 2.5)² + (y - 1.5)² = 35/2

so, r² = 35/2, and the area is πr² = π*(35/2) = 35π/2.

yes, that matches what i had earlier. so, the area of the circle is 35π/2.
