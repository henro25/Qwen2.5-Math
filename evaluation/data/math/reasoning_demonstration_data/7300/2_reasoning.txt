Reasoning: So i have this problem: "how many integers from 1 through 9999, inclusive, do not contain any of the digits 2, 3, 4, or 5?" okay, so i need to find out how many numbers in that range don't have any of those four digits. let me think about how to approach this.

first, the range is from 1 to 9999. that means we're dealing with numbers that have up to four digits. so, numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, or 4-digit numbers. i need to make sure i consider all of these.

now, the condition is that none of the digits in the number can be 2, 3, 4, or 5. so, the allowed digits are 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, and 9. thatâ€™s six possible digits for each place, except for the first digit in numbers with more than one digit, which can't be zero because that would make it a smaller number. for example, a 2-digit number can't start with zero; otherwise, it would be a 1-digit number.

wait, but the problem includes numbers from 1 to 9999, so 1 is included, and 9999 is included. so, i need to consider that 1 is a 1-digit number and 9999 is a 4-digit number.

maybe i should think in terms of counting the numbers based on the number of digits they have.

let's start with 1-digit numbers. these are from 1 to 9.

allowed digits for 1-digit numbers: 0 is not allowed because that would be zero, which is not in the range from 1 to 9999, but actually, zero isn't in the range, so for 1-digit numbers, allowed digits are 1, 6, 7, 8, 9. that's five options.

wait, but the problem says from 1 through 9999, inclusive, so zero isn't included at all. so for 1-digit numbers, it's 1-9, excluding 2,3,4,5. so yes, allowed digits are 1,6,7,8,9. five options.

now for 2-digit numbers, from 10 to 99.

first digit can't be zero, and can't be 2,3,4,5. so allowed first digits are 1,6,7,8,9. again, five options.

second digit can be zero, but can't be 2,3,4,5. so allowed digits are 0,1,6,7,8,9. that's six options.

so for 2-digit numbers: 5 choices for the first digit, 6 for the second, total 5*6 = 30 numbers.

similarly, for 3-digit numbers, from 100 to 999.

first digit: 1,6,7,8,9 (5 options).

second digit: 0,1,6,7,8,9 (6 options).

third digit: same as second digit, 6 options.

so total for 3-digit numbers: 5*6*6 = 180 numbers.

for 4-digit numbers, from 1000 to 9999.

first digit: 1,6,7,8,9 (5 options).

second, third, and fourth digits: each can be 0,1,6,7,8,9 (6 options each).

so total for 4-digit numbers: 5*6*6*6 = 5*216 = 1080 numbers.

now, summing up all the possibilities:

1-digit: 5

2-digit: 30

3-digit: 180

4-digit: 1080

total: 5 + 30 + 180 + 1080 = 1295.

wait, but is there a better way to calculate this without breaking it down by the number of digits?

maybe i can think of it as 4-digit numbers with leading zeros, from 0000 to 9999, and then subtract the number that starts with zero, but since zero isn't allowed in the range from 1 to 9999, i have to be careful.

alternatively, considering that numbers from 1 to 9999 can be treated as 4-digit numbers with leading zeros, and then subtracting the number 0000, which isn't in the range.

so, total numbers from 0000 to 9999 is 10,000. but we need from 0001 to 9999, which is 9999 numbers, but actually, the problem says from 1 to 9999, so it's 9999 numbers.

but maybe it's easier to consider all 4-digit numbers with leading zeros and then subtract the cases where numbers have 2,3,4,5 in any digit.

wait, perhaps i should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

let me think again.

if i consider all 4-digit numbers with leading zeros, from 0000 to 9999, that's 10,000 numbers.

but we need numbers from 0001 to 9999, which is 9999 numbers.

however, 0000 isn't included in the original range, so maybe it's better to stick with the initial approach.

alternatively, maybe i can calculate the total number of 4-digit numbers (including leading zeros) that don't contain any of the digits 2,3,4,5, and then subtract 1 if 0000 is included.

so, for a 4-digit number with possibly leading zeros, each digit can be 0,1,6,7,8,9, except that for the first digit, if it's zero, it's allowed because we're including leading zeros.

wait, but in the original problem, numbers from 1 to 9999, so 0000 isn't included.

but if i consider numbers from 0000 to 9999, and then subtract 0000, that would give me 9999 numbers.

but maybe it's simpler to calculate the total number of 4-digit numbers with digits only from 0,1,6,7,8,9, and then subtract 1 if 0000 is included.

so, for each digit, there are 6 choices: 0,1,6,7,8,9.

so, total 6^4 = 1296 numbers.

but 0000 is included in this count, and it's not in the original range.

so, total numbers from 1 to 9999 that don't contain 2,3,4,5 would be 1296 - 1 = 1295.

wait a minute, that matches the earlier total i got by summing the numbers based on the number of digits.

so, both methods give me 1295.

that seems consistent.

alternatively, perhaps there's a formula or a better way to generalize this.

but since both methods give the same answer, i can be more confident that 1295 is the correct total.

let me double-check the initial approach.

for 1-digit numbers: allowed digits are 1,6,7,8,9 (5 options).

for 2-digit numbers: first digit 1,6,7,8,9 (5 options); second digit 0,1,6,7,8,9 (6 options); total 5*6 = 30.

for 3-digit numbers: first digit 5 options, second and third digits 6 options each; total 5*6*6 = 180.

for 4-digit numbers: first digit 5 options, and the other three digits 6 options each; total 5*6*6*6 = 1080.

sum: 5 + 30 + 180 + 1080 = 1295.

yes, that seems correct.

alternatively, considering all 4-digit numbers with leading zeros, total 6^4 = 1296, subtracting 0000 gives 1295.

so, both approaches confirm that the answer is 1295.

i don't see any mistakes in this reasoning.

**final answer**

1295
