Reasoning: 
So i've got this trigonometric expression to simplify: 
sin
⁡
x
+
sin
⁡
2
x
1
+
cos
⁡
x
+
cos
⁡
2
x
1+cosx+cos2x
sinx+sin2x
​
 . i need to make this simpler, but i'm not exactly sure where to start. maybe i should look at some trigonometric identities that could help me simplify both the numerator and the denominator.

first, let's look at the numerator: 
sin
⁡
x
+
sin
⁡
2
x
sinx+sin2x. i know that there are identities for the sum of sines. specifically, there's a formula for 
sin
⁡
a
+
sin
⁡
b
sina+sinb, which is 
2
sin
⁡
(
a
+
b
2
)
cos
⁡
(
a
−
b
2
)
2sin( 
2
a+b
​
 )cos( 
2
a−b
​
 ). let's see if that applies here.

let me set 
a
=
x
a=x and 
b
=
2
x
b=2x. then:

sin
⁡
x
+
sin
⁡
2
x
=
2
sin
⁡
(
x
+
2
x
2
)
cos
⁡
(
x
−
2
x
2
)
=
2
sin
⁡
(
3
x
2
)
cos
⁡
(
−
x
2
)
sinx+sin2x=2sin( 
2
x+2x
​
 )cos( 
2
x−2x
​
 )=2sin( 
2
3x
​
 )cos(− 
2
x
​
 )
hmm, but cosine is an even function, so 
cos
⁡
(
−
θ
)
=
cos
⁡
θ
cos(−θ)=cosθ. so this simplifies to:

2
sin
⁡
(
3
x
2
)
cos
⁡
(
x
2
)
2sin( 
2
3x
​
 )cos( 
2
x
​
 )
alright, that's a bit simpler. now, let's look at the denominator: 
1
+
cos
⁡
x
+
cos
⁡
2
x
1+cosx+cos2x. i need to simplify this part as well. there are identities for the sum of cosines too. i recall that 
cos
⁡
a
+
cos
⁡
b
=
2
cos
⁡
(
a
+
b
2
)
cos
⁡
(
a
−
b
2
)
cosa+cosb=2cos( 
2
a+b
​
 )cos( 
2
a−b
​
 ).

let's apply that to 
cos
⁡
x
+
cos
⁡
2
x
cosx+cos2x. set 
a
=
2
x
a=2x and 
b
=
x
b=x:

cos
⁡
x
+
cos
⁡
2
x
=
2
cos
⁡
(
2
x
+
x
2
)
cos
⁡
(
2
x
−
x
2
)
=
2
cos
⁡
(
3
x
2
)
cos
⁡
(
x
2
)
cosx+cos2x=2cos( 
2
2x+x
​
 )cos( 
2
2x−x
​
 )=2cos( 
2
3x
​
 )cos( 
2
x
​
 )
so, the denominator becomes:

1
+
2
cos
⁡
(
3
x
2
)
cos
⁡
(
x
2
)
1+2cos( 
2
3x
​
 )cos( 
2
x
​
 )
hmm, that's still a bit messy. maybe there's another way to approach this. alternatively, i know that 
1
+
cos
⁡
x
=
2
cos
⁡
2
(
x
2
)
1+cosx=2cos 
2
 ( 
2
x
​
 ), from the double-angle identity. let's try that.

so, 
1
+
cos
⁡
x
=
2
cos
⁡
2
(
x
2
)
1+cosx=2cos 
2
 ( 
2
x
​
 ), and 
cos
⁡
2
x
=
2
cos
⁡
2
x
−
1
cos2x=2cos 
2
 x−1, but that might not help directly. wait, maybe i should express everything in terms of 
cos
⁡
(
x
2
)
cos( 
2
x
​
 ) and 
sin
⁡
(
x
2
)
sin( 
2
x
​
 ).

let me try another approach for the denominator. let's consider that 
1
+
cos
⁡
x
+
cos
⁡
2
x
1+cosx+cos2x can be combined using sum-to-product identities or multiple-angle formulas.

alternatively, i could write 
cos
⁡
2
x
cos2x in terms of 
cos
⁡
x
cosx: 
cos
⁡
2
x
=
2
cos
⁡
2
x
−
1
cos2x=2cos 
2
 x−1. so, plugging that in:

1
+
cos
⁡
x
+
cos
⁡
2
x
=
1
+
cos
⁡
x
+
2
cos
⁡
2
x
−
1
=
cos
⁡
x
+
2
cos
⁡
2
x
=
cos
⁡
x
(
1
+
2
cos
⁡
x
)
1+cosx+cos2x=1+cosx+2cos 
2
 x−1=cosx+2cos 
2
 x=cosx(1+2cosx)
hmm, not sure if that helps much. maybe i should consider factoring or looking for common terms.

wait a minute, going back to the numerator, i had:

sin
⁡
x
+
sin
⁡
2
x
=
2
sin
⁡
(
3
x
2
)
cos
⁡
(
x
2
)
sinx+sin2x=2sin( 
2
3x
​
 )cos( 
2
x
​
 )
and the denominator, after trying different things, is:

1
+
cos
⁡
x
+
cos
⁡
2
x
=
1
+
cos
⁡
x
+
(
2
cos
⁡
2
x
−
1
)
=
cos
⁡
x
+
2
cos
⁡
2
x
=
cos
⁡
x
(
1
+
2
cos
⁡
x
)
1+cosx+cos2x=1+cosx+(2cos 
2
 x−1)=cosx+2cos 
2
 x=cosx(1+2cosx)
so, putting them together:

2
sin
⁡
(
3
x
2
)
cos
⁡
(
x
2
)
cos
⁡
x
(
1
+
2
cos
⁡
x
)
cosx(1+2cosx)
2sin( 
2
3x
​
 )cos( 
2
x
​
 )
​
 
this still looks complicated. maybe there's a better way to simplify both numerator and denominator.

let me try expressing everything in terms of 
sin
⁡
x
sinx and 
cos
⁡
x
cosx without using the sum-to-product identities.

alternatively, perhaps using the double-angle identity for sine in the numerator: 
sin
⁡
2
x
=
2
sin
⁡
x
cos
⁡
x
sin2x=2sinxcosx. so, the numerator becomes:

sin
⁡
x
+
2
sin
⁡
x
cos
⁡
x
=
sin
⁡
x
(
1
+
2
cos
⁡
x
)
sinx+2sinxcosx=sinx(1+2cosx)
that's simpler! so, the numerator is 
sin
⁡
x
(
1
+
2
cos
⁡
x
)
sinx(1+2cosx).

now, the denominator is 
1
+
cos
⁡
x
+
cos
⁡
2
x
1+cosx+cos2x. let's use the double-angle identity for 
cos
⁡
2
x
cos2x: 
cos
⁡
2
x
=
2
cos
⁡
2
x
−
1
cos2x=2cos 
2
 x−1. plugging that in:

1
+
cos
⁡
x
+
(
2
cos
⁡
2
x
−
1
)
=
1
+
cos
⁡
x
+
2
cos
⁡
2
x
−
1
=
cos
⁡
x
+
2
cos
⁡
2
x
=
cos
⁡
x
(
1
+
2
cos
⁡
x
)
1+cosx+(2cos 
2
 x−1)=1+cosx+2cos 
2
 x−1=cosx+2cos 
2
 x=cosx(1+2cosx)
so, the denominator is 
cos
⁡
x
(
1
+
2
cos
⁡
x
)
cosx(1+2cosx).

now, putting numerator and denominator together:

sin
⁡
x
(
1
+
2
cos
⁡
x
)
cos
⁡
x
(
1
+
2
cos
⁡
x
)
cosx(1+2cosx)
sinx(1+2cosx)
​
 
oh, look at that! the 
(
1
+
2
cos
⁡
x
)
(1+2cosx) terms cancel out, assuming 
1
+
2
cos
⁡
x
≠
0
1+2cosx

=0, which would be true except when 
cos
⁡
x
=
−
1
2
cosx=− 
2
1
​
 , but i'll assume that's not the case for now.

so, we're left with:

sin
⁡
x
cos
⁡
x
=
tan
⁡
x
cosx
sinx
​
 =tanx
therefore, the simplified form of the original expression is 
tan
⁡
x
tanx.

let me just double-check to make sure i didn't make any mistakes. starting with:

sin
⁡
x
+
sin
⁡
2
x
1
+
cos
⁡
x
+
cos
⁡
2
x
1+cosx+cos2x
sinx+sin2x
​
 
expressed 
sin
⁡
2
x
sin2x as 
2
sin
⁡
x
cos
⁡
x
2sinxcosx, giving 
sin
⁡
x
(
1
+
2
cos
⁡
x
)
sinx(1+2cosx).

for the denominator, expressed 
cos
⁡
2
x
cos2x as 
2
cos
⁡
2
x
−
1
2cos 
2
 x−1, leading to 
cos
⁡
x
(
1
+
2
cos
⁡
x
)
cosx(1+2cosx).

canceled out the 
(
1
+
2
cos
⁡
x
)
(1+2cosx) terms, resulting in 
sin
⁡
x
cos
⁡
x
=
tan
⁡
x
cosx
sinx
​
 =tanx.

seems correct to me. i don't think there's a simpler form than 
tan
⁡
x
tanx, so that should be the final answer.

**final answer**

tan
⁡
x
tanx
