Answer: Given points \( a_0 = (0,0) \) and distinct points \( a_1, a_2, \ldots \) on the \( x \)-axis, and distinct points \( b_1, b_2, \ldots \) on the curve \( y = \sqrt{x} \), we need to find the smallest \( n \) such that the distance \( a_0a_n \geq 100 \), given that \( a_{n-1}b_na_n \) forms an equilateral triangle for each \( n \).

first, we determine the positions of \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) by considering the properties of equilateral triangles. we find that the distances between consecutive points \( a_{n-1} \) and \( a_n \) form a pattern.

by solving the recurrence relation and summing the series, we find that the total distance \( a_0a_n \) is given by:

\[
s_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{3}
\]

we need to find the smallest \( n \) such that:

\[
\frac{n(n+1)}{3} \geq 100
\]

multiplying both sides by 3:

\[
n(n+1) \geq 300
\]

solving the quadratic inequality \( n^2 + n - 300 \geq 0 \):

\[
n = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 1200}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1201}}{2}
\]

approximating \( \sqrt{1201} \approx 34.66 \):

\[
n \approx \frac{-1 + 34.66}{2} \approx 16.83
\]

since \( n \) must be an integer, the smallest \( n \) is 17.

therefore, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{17}
\]
