Reasoning: So i'm trying to solve this problem. let's see what it's about. we have points a₀, a₁, a₂, and so on, all lying on the x-axis, and points b₁, b₂, etc., lying on the curve y = sqrt(x). for each positive integer n, the points aₙ₋₁, bₙ, and aₙ form an equilateral triangle. i need to find the smallest n such that the distance from a₀ to aₙ is at least 100.

first, i need to understand the setup. we have a sequence of points on the x-axis and another sequence on the curve y = sqrt(x), and for each n, the three points aₙ₋₁, bₙ, and aₙ form an equilateral triangle. so, for each n, i have a triangle with vertices at aₙ₋₁, bₙ, and aₙ, and all sides are equal in length.

let me try to visualize this. a₀ is at (0,0). let's say a₁ is at (x₁, 0), b₁ is at (b₁, sqrt(b₁)), and so on. since a₀, b₁, a₁ form an equilateral triangle, the distances a₀b₁, b₁a₁, and a₀a₁ should all be equal.

let me denote aₙ as (xₙ, 0) and bₙ as (bₙ, sqrt(bₙ)).

for the first triangle, a₀a₁b₁ is equilateral. so, the distance a₀a₁ should be equal to a₀b₁ and to b₁a₁.

let's write down the distances:

1. a₀a₁ = |x₁ - 0| = x₁ (since they're on the x-axis and x₁ > 0, assuming points are to the right of a₀).

2. a₀b₁ = sqrt( (b₁ - 0)^2 + (sqrt(b₁) - 0)^2 ) = sqrt( b₁² + b₁ ) = sqrt( b₁² + b₁ ).

3. b₁a₁ = sqrt( (x₁ - b₁)^2 + (0 - sqrt(b₁})^2 ) = sqrt( (x₁ - b₁)^2 + b₁ ).

since a₀a₁ = a₀b₁, we have x₁ = sqrt( b₁² + b₁ ). also, a₀a₁ = b₁a₁, so x₁ = sqrt( (x₁ - b₁)^2 + b₁ ).

this seems a bit messy. maybe there's a better way to approach this.

i recall that in an equilateral triangle, all angles are 60 degrees, and perhaps i can use some trigonometry here.

alternatively, maybe i can think about the coordinates of b₁ in terms of a₀ and a₁.

let me consider that the triangle a₀a₁b₁ is equilateral. so, if i know two points, i can find the third one using rotation.

specifically, if i have points a and b, the third point c to form an equilateral triangle can be found by rotating point b around point a by 60 degrees, or by rotating point a around point b by 60 degrees.

since a₀ is at (0,0) and a₁ is at (x₁, 0), and b₁ is at (b₁, sqrt(b₁)), perhaps i can use rotation matrices to find the coordinates.

let me try rotating a₁ around a₀ by 60 degrees to get b₁.

the rotation matrix for 60 degrees is:

[ cos(60°)  -sin(60°) ]

[ sin(60°)   cos(60°) ]

so, rotating a₁ (x₁, 0) by 60 degrees around a₀ (0,0) gives:

( x₁ cos(60°) - 0 sin(60°), x₁ sin(60°) + 0 cos(60°) ) = ( x₁*(0.5), x₁*(sqrt(3)/2) )

but b₁ is given as (b₁, sqrt(b₁)), so:

b₁ = x₁*(0.5)

sqrt(b₁) = x₁*(sqrt(3)/2)

from the first equation, b₁ = x₁/2.

substitute into the second equation:

sqrt(x₁/2) = x₁*(sqrt(3)/2)

let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

x₁/2 = x₁²*(3/4)

multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:

2x₁ = 3x₁²

bring all terms to one side:

3x₁² - 2x₁ = 0

factor:

x₁(3x₁ - 2) = 0

so, x₁ = 0 or x₁ = 2/3.

but x₁ = 0 would mean a₁ is at the same point as a₀, which can't be since points are distinct. so, x₁ = 2/3.

then, b₁ = x₁/2 = (2/3)/2 = 1/3.

so, a₁ is at (2/3, 0), and b₁ is at (1/3, sqrt(1/3)).

okay, that's for n=1.

now, i need to find a general pattern for aₙ.

perhaps i can find a relationship between aₙ and aₙ₋₁.

let me consider the next triangle, a₁b₂a₂.

similarly, a₁a₂b₂ is equilateral.

so, a₁ is at (2/3, 0), a₂ is at (x₂, 0), and b₂ is at (b₂, sqrt(b₂)).

using the same rotation approach, rotating a₂ around a₁ by 60 degrees should give me b₂.

the rotation matrix is the same:

[ cos(60°)  -sin(60°) ]

[ sin(60°)   cos(60°) ]

so, b₂ = a₁ + rotation of (a₂ - a₁) by 60 degrees.

that is:

b₂ = a₁ + [ (x₂ - x₁) cos(60°) - 0 sin(60°), (x₂ - x₁) sin(60°) + 0 cos(60°) ]

since a₂ is on the x-axis, its y-coordinate is 0.

so, b₂ = (x₁ + (x₂ - x₁)*0.5, 0 + (x₂ - x₁)*(sqrt(3)/2))

but b₂ is also given as (b₂, sqrt(b₂)), so:

b₂ = x₁ + 0.5(x₂ - x₁) = x₁*0.5 + 0.5x₂

sqrt(b₂) = (x₂ - x₁)*(sqrt(3)/2)

from the first equation:

b₂ = 0.5x₁ + 0.5x₂

from the second equation:

(x₂ - x₁) = (2 sqrt(b₂))/sqrt(3)

but b₂ = 0.5x₁ + 0.5x₂, so:

x₂ - x₁ = (2 sqrt(0.5x₁ + 0.5x₂))/sqrt(3)

this seems complicated. maybe there's a better way to relate x₂ to x₁.

alternatively, perhaps i can find a recursive formula for xₙ in terms of xₙ₋₁.

let me consider the general case.

suppose aₙ₋₁ is at (xₙ₋₁, 0), aₙ is at (xₙ, 0), and bₙ is at (bₙ, sqrt(bₙ)).

since aₙ₋₁, bₙ, aₙ form an equilateral triangle, the distance aₙ₋₁bₙ = aₙ₋₁aₙ = aₙbₙ.

let me compute aₙ₋₁aₙ, which is |xₙ - xₙ₋₁|.

compute aₙ₋₁bₙ:

sqrt( (bₙ - xₙ₋₁)^2 + (sqrt(bₙ) - 0)^2 ) = sqrt( (bₙ - xₙ₋₁)^2 + bₙ )

set this equal to |xₙ - xₙ₋₁|:

sqrt( (bₙ - xₙ₋₁)^2 + bₙ ) = |xₙ - xₙ₋₁|

similarly, aₙbₙ = sqrt( (bₙ - xₙ)^2 + (sqrt(bₙ})^2 ) = sqrt( (bₙ - xₙ)^2 + bₙ )

set this equal to |xₙ - xₙ₋₁|.

so, i have:

sqrt( (bₙ - xₙ₋₁)^2 + bₙ ) = sqrt( (bₙ - xₙ)^2 + bₙ ) = |xₙ - xₙ₋₁|

this seems symmetric, but it's still a bit messy.

maybe i can consider the geometry of the situation differently.

alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the positions of aₙ.

from n=1, we have a₀ at (0,0), a₁ at (2/3, 0).

let me try to find a₂.

from the previous step, it's getting complicated, so maybe i should look for a pattern or a recursive relation.

alternatively, perhaps i can think in terms of vectors or complex numbers.

let me try to represent points as complex numbers.

let aₙ be represented by xₙ on the real axis, and bₙ by bₙ + i sqrt(bₙ).

since the triangle aₙ₋₁ bₙ aₙ is equilateral, the vector from aₙ₋₁ to bₙ should be a 60-degree rotation of the vector from aₙ₋₁ to aₙ.

in complex numbers, rotation by 60 degrees can be represented by multiplication by e^(iπ/3) = cos(60°) + i sin(60°) = 0.5 + i (sqrt(3)/2).

so, bₙ - aₙ₋₁ = (aₙ - aₙ₋₁) * (0.5 + i sqrt(3)/2)

let me write this equation:

bₙ - xₙ₋₁ = (xₙ - xₙ₋₁)(0.5 + i sqrt(3)/2)

but bₙ is a real number plus i times sqrt(bₙ):

bₙ - xₙ₋₁ + 0i = (xₙ - xₙ₋₁)(0.5 + i sqrt(3)/2)

so, equating real and imaginary parts:

real: bₙ - xₙ₋₁ = 0.5(xₙ - xₙ₋₁)

imaginary: 0 = (xₙ - xₙ₋₁)(sqrt(3)/2)

wait a minute, the imaginary part should equal sqrt(bₙ), since bₙ is given as (bₙ, sqrt(bₙ)). so perhaps i need to adjust this.

wait, perhaps i should represent bₙ as bₙ + i sqrt(bₙ).

then, the equation is:

bₙ + i sqrt(bₙ) - xₙ₋₁ = (xₙ - xₙ₋₁)(0.5 + i sqrt(3)/2)

now, equate real and imaginary parts:

real: bₙ - xₙ₋₁ = 0.5(xₙ - xₙ₋₁)

imaginary: sqrt(bₙ) = (xₙ - xₙ₋₁)(sqrt(3)/2)

from the imaginary part:

xₙ - xₙ₋₁ = (2 sqrt(bₙ)) / sqrt(3)

from the real part:

bₙ - xₙ₋₁ = 0.5(xₙ - xₙ₋₁)

substitute xₙ - xₙ₋₁ from the imaginary part into the real part:

bₙ - xₙ₋₁ = 0.5*(2 sqrt(bₙ)/sqrt(3)) = (sqrt(bₙ)/sqrt(3))

so, bₙ - xₙ₋₁ = sqrt(bₙ)/sqrt(3)

let me solve for bₙ:

bₙ - xₙ₋₁ = sqrt(bₙ)/sqrt(3)

let me denote sqrt(bₙ) = yₙ, so bₙ = yₙ².

then:

yₙ² - xₙ₋₁ = yₙ / sqrt(3)

rearranged:

yₙ² - yₙ / sqrt(3) - xₙ₋₁ = 0

this is a quadratic equation in terms of yₙ.

let me solve for yₙ:

yₙ = [ (1/sqrt(3)) ± sqrt( (1/sqrt(3))² + 4xₙ₋₁ ) ] / 2

this seems messy. maybe there's another way.

alternatively, perhaps i can relate xₙ and xₙ₋₁ directly.

from xₙ - xₙ₋₁ = (2 sqrt(bₙ))/sqrt(3), and bₙ = yₙ², but this is getting too complicated.

let me see if there's a pattern from the first few terms.

from n=1:

a₀ = 0

a₁ = 2/3

now, let's find a₂.

using the same method:

a₁ = 2/3

b₂ is such that a₁, b₂, a₂ form an equilateral triangle.

so, similar to before:

b₂ = x₁ + 0.5(x₂ - x₁) = 0.5x₁ + 0.5x₂

and sqrt(b₂) = (x₂ - x₁)(sqrt(3)/2)

from the first equation: b₂ = 0.5x₁ + 0.5x₂

from the second equation: x₂ - x₁ = (2 sqrt(b₂))/sqrt(3)

substitute b₂ from the first equation into the second:

x₂ - x₁ = (2 sqrt(0.5x₁ + 0.5x₂))/sqrt(3)

this seems recursive and not easy to solve directly.

maybe i can assume that the distances between consecutive a's form a geometric sequence or something like that.

from n=1: a₀a₁ = 2/3

suppose a₁a₂ = r * a₀a₁ = r*(2/3)

then a₂a₃ = r^2*(2/3), and so on.

if that's the case, then the total distance a₀aₙ would be a geometric series: 2/3 (1 + r + r² + ... + r^{n-1})

but i need to find r.

wait, perhaps in each step, the distance is multiplied by a constant ratio.

from n=1: a₀a₁ = 2/3

from n=2: a₁a₂ = ?

from earlier, x₂ - x₁ = (2 sqrt(b₂))/sqrt(3)

and b₂ = 0.5x₁ + 0.5x₂ = 0.5*(2/3) + 0.5x₂ = 1/3 + 0.5x₂

so, x₂ - 2/3 = (2 sqrt(1/3 + 0.5x₂))/sqrt(3)

this seems complicated to solve for x₂.

maybe i should look for a pattern in the positions.

alternatively, perhaps there's a recursive formula for xₙ in terms of xₙ₋₁.

let me try to express xₙ in terms of xₙ₋₁.

from earlier:

xₙ - xₙ₋₁ = (2 sqrt(bₙ))/sqrt(3)

and bₙ = 0.5xₙ₋₁ + 0.5xₙ

so, xₙ - xₙ₋₁ = (2 sqrt(0.5xₙ₋₁ + 0.5xₙ))/sqrt(3)

this seems tricky to solve directly.

maybe i can assume that the distances are forming a geometric progression.

suppose a₀a₁ = d₁ = 2/3

a₁a₂ = d₂ = r*d₁

a₂a₃ = d₃ = r*d₂ = r²*d₁

and so on, up to a_{n-1}a_n = d_n = r^{n-1}*d₁

then, the total distance a₀a_n = d₁ + d₂ + ... + d_n = d₁*(1 + r + r² + ... + r^{n-1}) = (2/3)*(1 - r^n)/(1 - r)

if r < 1, then as n increases, this approaches (2/3)/(1 - r)

but i need to find r such that this sequence makes sense in the context of the problem.

alternatively, perhaps the distances are decreasing by a factor related to the cosine of 60 degrees or something like that.

wait, maybe i can think about the projection.

in an equilateral triangle, the height is h = (sqrt(3)/2)*side.

in this case, the vertical component is sqrt(bₙ), which should be equal to h.

so, sqrt(bₙ) = (sqrt(3)/2)*aₙ₋₁aₙ

therefore, sqrt(bₙ) = (sqrt(3)/2)*(xₙ - xₙ₋₁)

and from earlier, bₙ = 0.5xₙ₋₁ + 0.5xₙ

so, 0.5xₙ₋₁ + 0.5xₙ = [ (sqrt(3)/2)*(xₙ - xₙ₋₁) ]²

wait, no.

wait, sqrt(bₙ) = (sqrt(3)/2)*(xₙ - xₙ₋₁)

then, bₙ = [ (sqrt(3)/2)*(xₙ - xₙ₋₁) ]² = (3/4)*(xₙ - xₙ₋₁)^2

but also, bₙ = 0.5xₙ₋₁ + 0.5xₙ

so, 0.5xₙ₋₁ + 0.5xₙ = (3/4)*(xₙ - xₙ₋₁)^2

let me simplify this equation.

multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:

2xₙ₋₁ + 2xₙ = 3(xₙ - xₙ₋₁)^2

expand the right side:

2xₙ₋₁ + 2xₙ = 3(xₙ² - 2xₙ xₙ₋₁ + xₙ₋₁²)

bring all terms to one side:

3xₙ² - 6xₙ xₙ₋₁ + 3xₙ₋₁² - 2xₙ - 2xₙ₋₁ = 0

this seems complicated. maybe i can assume that xₙ = k * xₙ₋₁, for some constant k.

let me suppose xₙ = k xₙ₋₁

then, substitute into the equation:

3(k xₙ₋₁)^2 - 6(k xₙ₋₁)(xₙ₋₁) + 3xₙ₋₁² - 2(k xₙ₋₁) - 2xₙ₋₁ = 0

simplify:

3k² xₙ₋₁² - 6k xₙ₋₁² + 3xₙ₋₁² - 2k xₙ₋₁ - 2xₙ₋₁ = 0

factor out xₙ₋₁:

xₙ₋₁ (3k² xₙ₋₁ - 6k xₙ₋₁ + 3xₙ₋₁ - 2k - 2) = 0

since xₙ₋₁ ≠ 0, we have:

3k² xₙ₋₁ - 6k xₙ₋₁ + 3xₙ₋₁ - 2k - 2 = 0

this still depends on xₙ₋₁, which suggests that the assumption xₙ = k xₙ₋₁ may not hold unless k is a specific value.

this approach doesn't seem to be working well. maybe i need to look for a different pattern or a different way to model the problem.

let me try to compute a few more terms manually to see if a pattern emerges.

from n=1:

a₀ = 0

a₁ = 2/3

b₁ = 1/3

now, for n=2:

a₁ = 2/3, b₂ = 0.5*a₁ + 0.5*a₂ = (1/3) + 0.5*a₂

and sqrt(b₂) = (a₂ - a₁)*(sqrt(3)/2)

from b₂ = 0.5*a₁ + 0.5*a₂ = (1/3) + 0.5*a₂

and sqrt(b₂) = (a₂ - 2/3)*(sqrt(3)/2)

let me square both sides:

b₂ = [(a₂ - 2/3)^2 * 3/4]

so,

(1/3) + 0.5*a₂ = [(a₂ - 2/3)^2 * 3/4]

multiply both sides by 4:

4*(1/3) + 2*a₂ = 3*(a₂ - 2/3)^2

simplify:

4/3 + 2a₂ = 3*(a₂² - (4/3)a₂ + 4/9)

expand the right side:

4/3 + 2a₂ = 3a₂² - 4a₂ + 4/3

bring all terms to one side:

3a₂² - 4a₂ - 2a₂ + 4/3 - 4/3 = 0

simplify:

3a₂² - 6a₂ = 0

factor:

3a₂(a₂ - 2) = 0

so, a₂ = 0 or a₂ = 2

but a₂ cannot be 0 since a₁ is already at 2/3, and points are distinct. so, a₂ = 2

therefore, a₂ is at (2, 0)

similarly, b₂ = 0.5*a₁ + 0.5*a₂ = 0.5*(2/3) + 0.5*2 = 1/3 + 1 = 4/3

and sqrt(b₂) = sqrt(4/3) = 2/sqrt(3)

which should equal (a₂ - a₁)*sqrt(3)/2 = (2 - 2/3)*sqrt(3)/2 = (4/3)*sqrt(3)/2 = (2/3)*sqrt(3)

indeed, 2/sqrt(3) = (2/3)*sqrt(3) * 3/1 = 2/sqrt(3), so it checks out.

now, for n=3:

a₂ = 2, b₃ = 0.5*a₂ + 0.5*a₃ = 1 + 0.5*a₃

and sqrt(b₃) = (a₃ - a₂)*sqrt(3)/2 = (a₃ - 2)*sqrt(3)/2

again, b₃ = 1 + 0.5*a₃

and sqrt(b₃) = (a₃ - 2)*sqrt(3)/2

square both sides:

b₃ = [(a₃ - 2)^2 * 3/4]

so,

1 + 0.5*a₃ = [(a₃ - 2)^2 * 3/4]

multiply both sides by 4:

4 + 2a₃ = 3*(a₃² - 4a₃ + 4)

expand the right side:

4 + 2a₃ = 3a₃² - 12a₃ + 12

bring all terms to one side:

3a₃² - 12a₃ - 2a₃ + 12 - 4 = 0

simplify:

3a₃² - 14a₃ + 8 = 0

solve the quadratic equation:

a₃ = [14 ± sqrt(196 - 96)] / 6 = [14 ± sqrt(100)] / 6 = [14 ± 10]/6

so, a₃ = (14 + 10)/6 = 24/6 = 4 or a₃ = (14 - 10)/6 = 4/6 = 2/3

but a₂ is at 2, and a₁ is at 2/3, so a₃ cannot be 2/3 again (since points are distinct). therefore, a₃ = 4

so, a₃ is at (4, 0)

similarly, b₃ = 1 + 0.5*4 = 1 + 2 = 3

and sqrt(b₃) = sqrt(3) = (4 - 2)*sqrt(3)/2 = 2*sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3), which matches.

now, for n=4:

a₃ = 4, b₄ = 0.5*a₃ + 0.5*a₄ = 2 + 0.5*a₄

and sqrt(b₄) = (a₄ - a₃)*sqrt(3)/2 = (a₄ - 4)*sqrt(3)/2

also, b₄ = 2 + 0.5*a₄

and sqrt(b₄) = (a₄ - 4)*sqrt(3)/2

square both sides:

b₄ = [(a₄ - 4)^2 * 3/4]

so,

2 + 0.5*a₄ = [(a₄ - 4)^2 * 3/4]

multiply both sides by 4:

8 + 2a₄ = 3*(a₄² - 8a₄ + 16)

expand the right side:

8 + 2a₄ = 3a₄² - 24a₄ + 48

bring all terms to one side:

3a₄² - 24a₄ - 2a₄ + 48 - 8 = 0

simplify:

3a₄² - 26a₄ + 40 = 0

solve the quadratic equation:

a₄ = [26 ± sqrt(676 - 480)] / 6 = [26 ± sqrt(196)] / 6 = [26 ± 14]/6

so, a₄ = (26 + 14)/6 = 40/6 = 6.666... or a₄ = (26 - 14)/6 = 12/6 = 2

but a₃ is at 4, and a₂ is at 2, so a₄ cannot be 2 (already used). therefore, a₄ = 40/6 = 20/3 ≈ 6.666...

wait, but in previous steps, a₀=0, a₁=2/3, a₂=2, a₃=4, a₄=?

wait, from n=3 to n=4, i got a₄=20/3, but looking at the pattern: 0, 2/3, 2, 4, 20/3,...

this doesn't seem to follow a clear pattern.

alternatively, perhaps i can look for a recurrence relation.

from a₀ to a₁: 2/3

a₁ to a₂: 2 - 2/3 = 4/3

a₂ to a₃: 4 - 2 = 2

a₃ to a₄: 20/3 - 4 = 20/3 - 12/3 = 8/3

so, the distances between consecutive a's are: 2/3, 4/3, 2, 8/3,...

this looks like a geometric sequence with ratio 2/1.

wait, 2/3 * 2 = 4/3, 4/3 * 2 = 8/3, but 8/3 is not equal to 2.

wait, 2 is equal to 6/3, which is not 8/3, so that doesn't match.

alternatively, perhaps the distances are doubling each time: 2/3, 4/3, 8/3, 16/3,...

but from 2/3 to 4/3 is doubling, 4/3 to 8/3 is doubling, but in reality, a₂ - a₁ = 4/3, a₃ - a₂ = 2, which is 6/3, not 8/3.

wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my calculation for a₄.

let me re-examine the calculation for a₄.

from earlier:

3a₄² - 26a₄ + 40 = 0

solutions:

a₄ = [26 ± sqrt(676 - 480)] / 6 = [26 ± sqrt(196)] / 6 = [26 ± 14]/6

so, a₄ = (26 + 14)/6 = 40/6 = 20/3 ≈ 6.666...

or a₄ = (26 - 14)/6 = 12/6 = 2

but a₃ is at 4, so a₄ cannot be 2, as that would not make sense in the sequence.

so, a₄ = 20/3

then, a₀a₄ = a₀a₁ + a₁a₂ + a₂a₃ + a₃a₄ = 2/3 + 4/3 + 2 + 8/3 = 2/3 + 4/3 + 6/3 + 8/3 = (2+4+6+8)/3 = 20/3 ≈ 6.666...

wait, but a₀a₄ should be a₀a₁ + a₁a₂ + a₂a₃ + a₃a₄ = 2/3 + 4/3 + 2 + 8/3 = 2/3 + 4/3 + 6/3 + 8/3 = (2+4+6+8)/3 = 20/3, which matches.

but this doesn't seem to be forming a geometric series. maybe i need to look for a different pattern.

alternatively, perhaps the total distance a₀aₙ is related to a geometric series.

let me list out the cumulative distances:

n | a₀aₙ

1 | 2/3 ≈ 0.666...

2 | 2/3 + 4/3 = 6/3 = 2

3 | 2 + 2 = 4

4 | 4 + 8/3 = 20/3 ≈ 6.666...

wait, 2/3, 2, 4, 20/3,...

this still doesn't seem to follow a clear pattern.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the ratio of consecutive distances.

from a₀a₁ = 2/3

a₁a₂ = 4/3

a₂a₃ = 2

a₃a₄ = 8/3

so, the ratios are:

a₁a₂ / a₀a₁ = (4/3)/(2/3) = 2

a₂a₃ / a₁a₂ = 2 / (4/3) = 3/2

a₃a₄ / a₂a₃ = (8/3)/2 = 4/3

this seems like the ratio is increasing: 2, 3/2, 4/3,...

so, perhaps the ratio is (n+1)/n for some n.

wait, for n=1: ratio = 2/1 = 2

n=2: 3/2

n=3: 4/3

so, in general, the ratio of aₙaₙ₊₁ to aₙ₋₁aₙ is (n+2)/(n+1)

wait, maybe i need to look for a different pattern.

alternatively, perhaps the cumulative distance a₀aₙ is proportional to n.

from n=1: 2/3 ≈ 0.666

n=2: 2

n=3: 4

n=4: 20/3 ≈ 6.666

it seems like a₀aₙ ≈ (n)(2/3) * something.

alternatively, perhaps i can look for a formula for a₀aₙ.

let me denote sₙ = a₀aₙ

from n=1: s₁ = 2/3

n=2: s₂ = 2

n=3: s₃ = 4

n=4: s₄ = 20/3 ≈ 6.666...

looking at these numbers: 2/3, 2, 4, 20/3,...

let me see the differences:

s₁ = 2/3

s₂ - s₁ = 2 - 2/3 = 4/3

s₃ - s₂ = 4 - 2 = 2

s₄ - s₃ = 20/3 - 4 = 8/3

so, the differences are: 2/3, 4/3, 2, 8/3,...

this seems like the differences are doubling every two steps.

wait, 2/3, 4/3, 2, 8/3,...

expressed as multiples of 2/3: 1*(2/3), 2*(2/3), 3*(2/3), 4*(2/3), etc.

wait, 1*(2/3) = 2/3

2*(2/3) = 4/3

3*(2/3) = 2

4*(2/3) = 8/3

so, the differences seem to be n*(2/3), where n is the step number.

wait, but for n=1, difference s₂ - s₁ = 4/3, which is 2*(2/3), not 1*(2/3).

wait, perhaps it's (n)*something.

wait, from n=1 to n=2: difference is 4/3 = 2*(2/3)

from n=2 to n=3: difference is 2 = 3*(2/3)

from n=3 to n=4: difference is 8/3 = 4*(2/3)

so, the differences seem to be (n+1)*(2/3)

wait, for n=1: difference s₂ - s₁ = 4/3 = 2*(2/3)

n=2: difference s₃ - s₂ = 2 = 3*(2/3)

n=3: difference s₄ - s₃ = 8/3 = 4*(2/3)

yes, so in general, the difference s_{n+1} - s_n = (n+1)*(2/3)

therefore, s_n = s_{n-1} + n*(2/3)

with s₀ = 0, s₁ = 2/3, s₂ = 2/3 + 4/3 = 2, s₃ = 2 + 2 = 4, s₄ = 4 + 8/3 = 20/3, etc.

so, s_n = s_{n-1} + (n)*(2/3)

this is a recursive relation.

to find a closed-form formula for s_n, we can sum the series:

s_n = sum from k=1 to n of (2k)/3 = (2/3) * sum from k=1 to n of k = (2/3)*(n(n+1)/2) = (n(n+1))/3

therefore, s_n = n(n+1)/3

so, the total distance from a₀ to a_n is s_n = n(n+1)/3

we need to find the smallest n such that s_n >= 100, i.e., n(n+1)/3 >= 100

multiply both sides by 3: n(n+1) >= 300

so, we need to solve n(n+1) >= 300

this is a quadratic inequality: n² + n - 300 >= 0

solve the equation n² + n - 300 = 0

using the quadratic formula: n = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 1200)] / 2 = [-1 ± sqrt(1201)] / 2

sqrt(1201) is approximately 34.66

so, n = (-1 + 34.66)/2 ≈ 16.83

since n must be an integer, and n >= 16.83, the smallest integer n is 17

therefore, the answer is 17, which corresponds to option (c)

**final answer**

17
