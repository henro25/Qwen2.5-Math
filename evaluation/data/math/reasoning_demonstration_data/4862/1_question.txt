Problem: Calculate $\sqrt{10p} \cdot \sqrt{5p^2} \cdot \sqrt{6p^4}$ . Express your answer in simplest radical form in terms of $p$.

Note: When entering a square root with more than one character, you must use parentheses or brackets.  For example, you should enter $\sqrt{14}$ as "sqrt(14)" or "sqrt{14}".
