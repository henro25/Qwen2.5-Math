Answer: To determine the number of different teams made up of two girls and two boys that can be chosen from the math club at pecanridge middle school, we use the combination formula:

\[
c(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}
\]

first, we calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls from 3:

\[
c(3, 2) = \frac{3!}{2!(3 - 2)!} = \frac{6}{2 \times 1} = 3
\]

next, we calculate the number of ways to choose 2 boys from 5:

\[
c(5, 2) = \frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!} = \frac{120}{2 \times 6} = 10
\]

to find the total number of different teams, we multiply the number of ways to choose the girls by the number of ways to choose the boys:

\[
\text{total teams} = c(3, 2) \times c(5, 2) = 3 \times 10 = 30
\]

therefore, the number of different teams that can be formed is:

\boxed{30}
