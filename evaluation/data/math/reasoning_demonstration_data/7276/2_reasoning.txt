Reasoning: Let's tackle this problem step by step. so, we have a math club with 3 girls and 5 boys, and we need to form a team of 4 members consisting of exactly 2 girls and 2 boys. the question is asking how many different such teams can be formed.

first, i need to understand what is being asked. we have to choose a team of 4 people, but with specific requirements: 2 girls and 2 boys. the math club has 3 girls and 5 boys to choose from.

i think the best way to approach this is to consider the combinations separately for girls and boys and then combine them.

let me recall the formula for combinations. the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items is given by the combination formula:

c
(
n
,
k
)
=
n
!
k
!
(
n
−
k
)
!
c(n,k)= 
k!(n−k)!
n!
​	
 
where "!" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

so, for the girls, we have 3 girls and we need to choose 2 of them. using the combination formula:

c
(
3
,
2
)
=
3
!
2
!
(
3
−
2
)
!
=

=

c(3,2)= 
2!(3−2)!
3!
​	
 = 
2×1
6
​	
 =3
so, there are 3 ways to choose 2 girls from 3.

next, for the boys, there are 5 boys and we need to choose 2 of them:

c
(
5
,
2
)
=
5
!
2
!
(
5
−
2
)

6
=
10
c(5,2)= 
2!(5−2)!
5!
​	
 = 
2×6
120
​	
 =10
so, there are 10 ways to choose 2 boys from 5.

now, since the choices of girls and boys are independent of each other, to find the total number of different teams, we should multiply the number of ways to choose the girls by the number of ways to choose the boys.

so, total number of teams = number of ways to choose girls × number of ways to choose boys

total teams
=
c
(
3
,
2
)

c
(

,

)

=
30
total teams=c(3,2)×c(5,2)=3×10=30
therefore, there are 30 different teams that can be formed consisting of 2 girls and 2 boys.

wait a minute, let me double-check that i haven't missed anything. the problem specifies that the team has to consist of exactly 2 girls and 2 boys, and i've considered all possible combinations for selecting 2 girls out of 3 and 2 boys out of 5, and multiplied them to get the total number of unique teams.

is there any overlap or double-counting here? hmm, no, because each combination of girls is paired with each combination of boys, and since the groups are distinct (girls and boys), there's no overlap.

alternatively, i could think of it as selecting the team members one by one, but that might complicate things since the order doesn't matter in a team.

let me consider another approach to confirm my answer. suppose i list out all possible combinations manually, but that would be time-consuming given the numbers involved. instead, i'll stick with the combination formula, which is the standard method for such problems.

just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any restriction on who can be on the team, but the problem doesn't mention any, so i assume all members are eligible.

therefore, my final answer is that there are 30 different teams that can be formed consisting of 2 girls and 2 boys from the math club.

**final answer**

30
