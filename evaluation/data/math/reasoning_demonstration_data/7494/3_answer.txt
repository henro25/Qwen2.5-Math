Answer: To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 2835 and 8960, we use the Euclidean algorithm:

1. Divide 8960 by 2835:
   - 8960 รท 2835 = 3 with a remainder of 455.

2. Divide 2835 by 455:
   - 2835 รท 455 = 6 with a remainder of 105.

3. Divide 455 by 105:
   - 455 รท 105 = 4 with a remainder of 35.

4. Divide 105 by 35:
   - 105 รท 35 = 3 with a remainder of 0.

Since the remainder is now zero, the last non-zero remainder is 35. Therefore, the greatest common factor of 2835 and 8960 is **35**.
