Problem: The reality game show Survivor is played with 16 people divided into two tribes of 8. In the first episode, two people get homesick and quit. If every person has an equal chance of being one of the two quitters, and the probability that one person quits is independent of the probability that any other person quits, what is the probability that both people who quit are from the same tribe?
