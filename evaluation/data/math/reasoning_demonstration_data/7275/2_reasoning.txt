Reasoning: Let's tackle this problem step by step. i've got two monic cubic polynomials, f(x) and g(x), and they each have two known roots in terms of some real number r. additionally, their difference is equal to r for all real numbers x. that's a bit tricky, but let's see.

first, since f(x) and g(x) are monic cubic polynomials, they each have three roots. for f(x), two of the roots are r + 1 and r + 7. let's denote the third root of f(x) as a. similarly, for g(x), two of the roots are r + 3 and r + 9, and let's denote the third root of g(x) as b.

so, we can write f(x) and g(x) in their factored forms:

f(x) = (x - (r + 1))(x - (r + 7))(x - a)

g(x) = (x - (r + 3))(x - (r + 9))(x - b)

since both are monic, the leading coefficient is 1.

now, the problem states that f(x) - g(x) = r for all real numbers x. that's interesting because if two polynomials differ by a constant for all x, their coefficients for like powers of x must be equal except for the constant term.

let's expand both f(x) and g(x) and then subtract them.

first, expand f(x):

f(x) = (x - (r + 1))(x - (r + 7))(x - a)

let's first multiply the first two factors:

(x - (r + 1))(x - (r + 7)) = x^2 - (r + 1 + r + 7)x + (r + 1)(r + 7) = x^2 - (2r + 8)x + (r^2 + 8r + 7)

now, multiply this by (x - a):

f(x) = (x^2 - (2r + 8)x + r^2 + 8r + 7)(x - a)

= x^3 - a x^2 - (2r + 8)x^2 + a(2r + 8)x + (r^2 + 8r + 7)x - a(r^2 + 8r + 7)

combine like terms:

f(x) = x^3 - (a + 2r + 8)x^2 + (a(2r + 8) + r^2 + 8r + 7)x - a(r^2 + 8r + 7)

similarly, expand g(x):

g(x) = (x - (r + 3))(x - (r + 9))(x - b)

first, multiply the first two factors:

(x - (r + 3))(x - (r + 9)) = x^2 - (r + 3 + r + 9)x + (r + 3)(r + 9) = x^2 - (2r + 12)x + (r^2 + 12r + 27)

now, multiply this by (x - b):

g(x) = (x^2 - (2r + 12)x + r^2 + 12r + 27)(x - b)

= x^3 - b x^2 - (2r + 12)x^2 + b(2r + 12)x + (r^2 + 12r + 27)x - b(r^2 + 12r + 27)

combine like terms:

g(x) = x^3 - (b + 2r + 12)x^2 + (b(2r + 12) + r^2 + 12r + 27)x - b(r^2 + 12r + 27)

now, f(x) - g(x) should equal r for all x:

f(x) - g(x) = [x^3 - (a + 2r + 8)x^2 + (a(2r + 8) + r^2 + 8r + 7)x - a(r^2 + 8r + 7)] - [x^3 - (b + 2r + 12)x^2 + (b(2r + 12) + r^2 + 12r + 27)x - b(r^2 + 12r + 27)] = r

simplify the left side:

f(x) - g(x) = x^3 - (a + 2r + 8)x^2 + (a(2r + 8) + r^2 + 8r + 7)x - a(r^2 + 8r + 7) - x^3 + (b + 2r + 12)x^2 - (b(2r + 12) + r^2 + 12r + 27)x + b(r^2 + 12r + 27) = r

the x^3 terms cancel out:

- (a + 2r + 8)x^2 + (a(2r + 8) + r^2 + 8r + 7)x - a(r^2 + 8r + 7) + (b + 2r + 12)x^2 - (b(2r + 12) + r^2 + 12r + 27)x + b(r^2 + 12r + 27) = r

now, group like terms:

[ - (a + 2r + 8) + (b + 2r + 12) ]x^2 + [ (a(2r + 8) + r^2 + 8r + 7) - (b(2r + 12) + r^2 + 12r + 27) ]x + [ -a(r^2 + 8r + 7) + b(r^2 + 12r + 27) ] = r

set this equal to r, which is a constant. for the equation to hold for all x, the coefficients of x^2 and x must be zero, and the constant term must equal r.

so, we have a system of equations:

1. coefficient of x^2: - (a + 2r + 8) + (b + 2r + 12) = 0

simplify:

- a - 2r - 8 + b + 2r + 12 = 0

- a + b + 4 = 0 => b = a - 4

2. coefficient of x: (a(2r + 8) + r^2 + 8r + 7) - (b(2r + 12) + r^2 + 12r + 27) = 0

simplify:

a(2r + 8) + r^2 + 8r + 7 - b(2r + 12) - r^2 - 12r - 27 = 0

the r^2 terms cancel out:

a(2r + 8) + 8r + 7 - b(2r + 12) - 12r - 27 = 0

now, substitute b = a - 4 from equation 1:

a(2r + 8) + 8r + 7 - (a - 4)(2r + 12) - 12r - 27 = 0

let's expand (a - 4)(2r + 12):

= a(2r + 12) - 4(2r + 12) = 2r a + 12a - 8r - 48

now, plug back in:

a(2r + 8) + 8r + 7 - (2r a + 12a - 8r - 48) - 12r - 27 = 0

distribute the negative sign:

a(2r + 8) + 8r + 7 - 2r a - 12a + 8r + 48 - 12r - 27 = 0

now, combine like terms:

a(2r + 8 - 2r) + (8r + 8r - 12r) + (7 + 48 - 27) - 12a = 0

simplify:

a(8) + (4r) + (28) - 12a = 0

so:

8a + 4r + 28 - 12a = 0

combine like terms:

-4a + 4r + 28 = 0

divide by 4:

- a + r + 7 = 0 => a = r + 7

from earlier, b = a - 4, so b = (r + 7) - 4 = r + 3

now, we have expressions for a and b in terms of r.

next, consider the constant term:

- a(r^2 + 8r + 7) + b(r^2 + 12r + 27) = r

substitute a = r + 7 and b = r + 3:

- (r + 7)(r^2 + 8r + 7) + (r + 3)(r^2 + 12r + 27) = r

let's expand both products:

first, expand -(r + 7)(r^2 + 8r + 7):

= - [ r(r^2 + 8r + 7) + 7(r^2 + 8r + 7) ]

= - [ r^3 + 8r^2 + 7r + 7r^2 + 56r + 49 ]

= - [ r^3 + 15r^2 + 63r + 49 ]

= -r^3 - 15r^2 - 63r - 49

next, expand (r + 3)(r^2 + 12r + 27):

= r(r^2 + 12r + 27) + 3(r^2 + 12r + 27)

= r^3 + 12r^2 + 27r + 3r^2 + 36r + 81

= r^3 + 15r^2 + 63r + 81

now, combine the two expansions:

- r^3 - 15r^2 - 63r - 49 + r^3 + 15r^2 + 63r + 81 = r

simplify:

(- r^3 + r^3) + (-15r^2 + 15r^2) + (-63r + 63r) + (-49 + 81) = r

so, 0 + 0 + 0 + 32 = r

therefore, r = 32

wait a minute, let me double-check that. it seems too straightforward, but i'll verify.

from the constant term equation:

- a(r^2 + 8r + 7) + b(r^2 + 12r + 27) = r

substituted a and b:

- (r + 7)(r^2 + 8r + 7) + (r + 3)(r^2 + 12r + 27) = r

expanded:

- r^3 - 15r^2 - 63r - 49 + r^3 + 15r^2 + 63r + 81 = r

simplified:

0r^3 + 0r^2 + 0r + 32 = r

so, 32 = r

yes, that seems correct. therefore, r = 32.

**final answer**

32
