Reasoning: 
So i've got this probability problem here. there are three math clubs in the school district with different numbers of students: one has 5 students, another has 7, and the last one has 8 students. each of these clubs has two co-presidents. the task is to find the probability that, when i randomly select one of these clubs and then randomly select three members from that club to give them a book, two of those selected are co-presidents.

first, i need to understand the structure of the problem. there are three clubs, each with a different number of students and each having two co-presidents. i'm supposed to select a club at random and then select three students from that club at random, and find the probability that exactly two of those selected are co-presidents.

since there are three clubs, and i'm selecting one at random, the probability of selecting any particular club is 1/3.

now, for each club, i need to find the probability that, when selecting three students, exactly two of them are co-presidents.

let's tackle each club one by one.

**first club: 5 students, 2 co-presidents**

total number of ways to select 3 students out of 5 is c(5,3), which is 10.

number of ways to select exactly two co-presidents and one non-co-president: there are c(2,2) ways to choose the two co-presidents, which is 1, and c(3,1) ways to choose one non-co-president from the remaining 3 students, which is 3. so, total favorable ways are 1 * 3 = 3.

therefore, the probability for this club is 3/10.

**second club: 7 students, 2 co-presidents**

total number of ways to select 3 students out of 7 is c(7,3), which is 35.

number of ways to select exactly two co-presidents and one non-co-president: c(2,2) = 1 way for the co-presidents, and c(5,1) = 5 ways for the non-co-president. so, total favorable ways are 1 * 5 = 5.

therefore, the probability for this club is 5/35, which simplifies to 1/7.

**third club: 8 students, 2 co-presidents**

total number of ways to select 3 students out of 8 is c(8,3), which is 56.

number of ways to select exactly two co-presidents and one non-co-president: c(2,2) = 1 way for the co-presidents, and c(6,1) = 6 ways for the non-co-president. so, total favorable ways are 1 * 6 = 6.

therefore, the probability for this club is 6/56, which simplifies to 3/28.

now, since each club is equally likely to be selected (each has a probability of 1/3), the total probability is the average of the probabilities for each club.

so, total probability = (1/3)*(3/10) + (1/3)*(1/7) + (1/3)*(3/28).

let's compute this step by step.

first, calculate each term:

(1/3)*(3/10) = 3/30 = 1/10.

(1/3)*(1/7) = 1/21.

(1/3)*(3/28) = 3/84 = 1/28.

now, sum these up: 1/10 + 1/21 + 1/28.

to add these fractions, i need a common denominator. let's find the least common multiple (lcm) of 10, 21, and 28.

prime factors:

10 = 2 * 5

21 = 3 * 7

28 = 2^2 * 7

so, lcm is 2^2 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 4 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 420.

now, convert each fraction to have denominator 420:

1/10 = 42/420

1/21 = 20/420

1/28 = 15/420

now, add them up: 42 + 20 + 15 = 77.

so, total probability is 77/420.

simplify this fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 7: 77 ÷ 7 = 11, 420 ÷ 7 = 60.

so, 11/60.

therefore, the probability is 11/60.

wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

first club: c(5,3)=10, favorable=3, probability=3/10. that seems correct.

second club: c(7,3)=35, favorable=5, probability=1/7. correct.

third club: c(8,3)=56, favorable=6, probability=3/28. correct.

total probability: (1/3)(3/10) + (1/3)(1/7) + (1/3)(3/28) = 1/10 + 1/21 + 1/28.

finding lcm of 10,21,28: 420.

convert to 42/420 + 20/420 + 15/420 = 77/420 = 11/60.

seems correct.

alternatively, maybe i can think of it differently, perhaps using conditional probability.

the overall approach seems sound.

so, the final answer should be 11/60.

**final answer**
