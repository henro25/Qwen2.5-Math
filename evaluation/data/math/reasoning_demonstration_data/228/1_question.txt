Problem: There are 3 math clubs in the school district, with 5, 7, and 8 students respectively. Each club has two co-presidents. If I randomly select a club, and then randomly select three members of that club to give a copy of $\emph{Introduction to} \allowbreak\ \emph{Counting and} \allowbreak\ \emph{Probability}$, what is the probability that two of the people who receive books are co-presidents?
