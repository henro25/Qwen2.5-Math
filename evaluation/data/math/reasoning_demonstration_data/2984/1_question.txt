Problem: $\triangle DEF$ is inscribed inside $\triangle ABC$ such that $D,E,F$ lie on $BC, AC, AB$, respectively. The circumcircles of $\triangle DEC, \triangle BFD, \triangle AFE$ have centers $O_1,O_2,O_3$, respectively. Also, $AB = 23, BC = 25, AC=24$, and $\stackrel{\frown}{BF} = \stackrel{\frown}{EC},\ \stackrel{\frown}{AF} = \stackrel{\frown}{CD},\ \stackrel{\frown}{AE} = \stackrel{\frown}{BD}$. The length of $BD$ can be written in the form $\frac mn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m+n$.
