Reasoning: Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. There are fifty cards, numbered from 1 to 50, and I need to find the probability that a randomly selected card has a number that's both prime and a multiple of 7. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I need to understand what it means for a number to be prime. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, and so on are prime. But wait, 1 is not considered a prime number, right? Yeah, I think that's correct.

Next, the number also needs to be a multiple of 7. A multiple of 7 would be any number that 7 divides into without leaving a remainder, like 7, 14, 21, 28, and so on.

So, the task is to find numbers between 1 and 50 that are both prime and multiples of 7. That seems a bit contradictory because, except for 7 itself, multiples of 7 are generally not prime since they are divisible by 7. Let me think about that.

Take 7, for example. 7 is a prime number, and it's also a multiple of 7 because 7 times 1 is 7. So, 7 fits both criteria. What about 14? 14 is a multiple of 7, but is it prime? No, because it can be divided by 1, 2, 7, and 14. So, 14 is not prime.

Similarly, 21 is a multiple of 7, but it's divisible by 1, 3, 7, and 21, so not prime. 28 is 7 times 4, so divisible by 4 and 7, not prime. 35 is 7 times 5, so again, not prime. 42 is 7 times 6, not prime. 49 is 7 times 7, so it's divisible by 7, not prime.

So, from this list, only 7 seems to satisfy both conditions. Is there any other number between 1 and 50 that is both prime and a multiple of 7? Let's check.

Starting from 7 and adding 7 each time: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49. As I've already checked, only 7 is prime among these. So, it seems like there's only one number that fits both criteria.

Now, to find the probability, I need to know the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes. The total number of possible outcomes is 50, since there are 50 cards numbered from 1 to 50.

The number of favorable outcomes is the number of cards that have a number which is both prime and a multiple of 7, which we've determined is only 7.

Therefore, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 1 out of 50.

But wait, let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed any other numbers that could be both prime and multiples of 7. Let's list all prime numbers between 1 and 50 first: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.

Now, from these, which ones are multiples of 7? Well, 7 is a multiple of 7, but none of the others are multiples of 7 because they're all primes greater than 7 and not divisible by 7.

So, again, only 7 fits both criteria.

Therefore, the probability is 1 out of 50, which can be expressed as the fraction 1/50.

I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, is there any other way this problem could be interpreted? Like, is there any number that is prime and somehow considered a multiple of 7 in a different sense? I don't think so. Multiples of 7 are straightforward: 7 times an integer.

Also, 1 is not prime, so that's not a concern here. And 7 is the only prime number that's a multiple of 7 in this range.

So, I'm confident that the probability is 1/50.
