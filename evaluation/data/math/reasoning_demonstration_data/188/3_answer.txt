Answer: To solve the problem of finding the probability that a randomly selected card from a box containing cards numbered 1 to 50 has a number that is both prime and a multiple of 7, we proceed as follows:

1. **Identify Prime Numbers Between 1 and 50:**
   The prime numbers in this range are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47.

2. **Identify Multiples of 7 Between 1 and 50:**
   The multiples of 7 in this range are: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 49.

3. **Find Numbers That Are Both Prime and Multiples of 7:**
   - 7 is both a prime number and a multiple of 7.
   - None of the other multiples of 7 (14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49) are prime, as they have divisors other than 1 and themselves.

4. **Determine the Probability:**
   - There is only 1 favorable outcome (the number 7).
   - The total number of possible outcomes is 50 (since there are 50 cards).

Thus, the probability is:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{1}{50}
\]

**Answer:** \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{50}}\)
