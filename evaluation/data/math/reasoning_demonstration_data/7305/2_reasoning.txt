Reasoning: I've got this problem here: i need to find how many complex numbers 
z
z with 
∣
z
∣
<
30
∣z∣<30 satisfy the equation 
e
z
=
z
−
1
z
+
1
e 
z
 = 
z+1
z−1
​	
 . hmm, complex equations can be tricky, especially when exponentials and rational functions are involved. let's break this down step by step.

first, i should probably rewrite the equation to make it easier to handle. so, starting with:

e
z
=
z
−
1
z
+
1
e 
z
 = 
z+1
z−1
​	
 
maybe i can rearrange this to bring all terms to one side:

e
z
⋅
(
z
+
1
)
=
z
−
1
e 
z
 ⋅(z+1)=z−1
expanding the left side:

e
z
⋅
z
+
e
z
=
z
−
1
e 
z
 ⋅z+e 
z
 =z−1
now, let's move all terms to one side:

e
z
⋅
z
+
e
z
−
z
+
1
=
0
e 
z
 ⋅z+e 
z
 −z+1=0
hmm, that doesn't seem particularly helpful. maybe there's a better way to approach this.

another thought: perhaps i can take the natural logarithm of both sides, but since 
z
z is complex, logarithms become multi-valued, which might complicate things further. maybe not the best route.

wait a minute, maybe i can consider the function 
f
(
z
)
=
e
z
−
z
−
1
z
+
1
f(z)=e 
z
 − 
z+1
z−1
​	
  and look for its zeros within the disk 
∣
z
∣
<
30
∣z∣<30. to find the number of zeros of a function in a given region, i recall that rouché's theorem might be applicable here.

rouché's theorem states that if two holomorphic functions 
f
f and 
g
g satisfy 
∣
f
(
z
)
∣
>
∣
g
(
z
)
∣
∣f(z)∣>∣g(z)∣ on some contour 
c
c, then 
f
f and 
f
+
g
f+g have the same number of zeros inside 
c
c.

in this case, if i can write the equation in the form 
f
(
z
)
+
g
(
z
)
=
0
f(z)+g(z)=0, and then apply rouché's theorem to 
f
(
z
)
=
−
e
z
f(z)=−e 
z
  and 
g
(
z
)
=
z
−
1
z
+
1
g(z)= 
z+1
z−1
​	
 , i might be able to find the number of zeros of the combined function inside 
∣
z
∣
<
30
∣z∣<30.

but before jumping into that, let's check if 
z
−
1
z
+
1
z+1
z−1
​	
  is holomorphic inside 
∣
z
∣
<
30
∣z∣<30. well, this function has a singularity at 
z
=
−
1
z=−1, which is inside the disk since 
∣
−
1
∣
=
1
<
30
∣−1∣=1<30. so, i need to be careful about that.

maybe i should consider a modified version of rouché's theorem that accounts for poles, or perhaps find another way to handle the singularity at 
z
=
−
1
z=−1.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the function 
h
(
z
)
=
e
z
(
z
+
1
)
−
(
z
−
1
)
h(z)=e 
z
 (z+1)−(z−1), which is similar to what i had earlier:

h
(
z
)
=
e
z
(
z
+
1
)
−
(
z
−
1
)
=
0
h(z)=e 
z
 (z+1)−(z−1)=0
this function 
h
(
z
)
h(z) is entire except for the point 
z
=
−
1
z=−1, but since 
z
=
−
1
z=−1 is a point inside the disk, i need to see if it's a zero or a pole of 
h
(
z
)
h(z).

wait, no, 
h
(
z
)
h(z) is defined at 
z
=
−
1
z=−1 because 
e
z
(
z
+
1
)
−
(
z
−
1
)
e 
z
 (z+1)−(z−1) doesn't have a singularity there; it's just a regular point. so, 
h
(
z
)
h(z) is entire.

now, to apply rouché's theorem, i need to choose 
f
(
z
)
f(z) and 
g
(
z
)
g(z) such that on the boundary 
∣
z
∣
=
30
∣z∣=30, one dominates the other.

let me set 
f
(
z
)
=
e
z
(
z
+
1
)
f(z)=e 
z
 (z+1) and 
g
(
z
)
=
−
(
z
−
1
)
g(z)=−(z−1), so that 
h
(
z
)
=
f
(
z
)
+
g
(
z
)
=
0
h(z)=f(z)+g(z)=0.

now, on 
∣
z
∣
=
30
∣z∣=30, i need to compare 
∣
f
(
z
)
∣
∣f(z)∣ and 
∣
g
(
z
)
∣
∣g(z)∣.

first, 
∣
f
(
z
)
∣
=
∣
e
z
(
z
+
1
)
∣
=
∣
e
z
∣
⋅
∣
z
+
1
∣
∣f(z)∣=∣e 
z
 (z+1)∣=∣e 
z
 ∣⋅∣z+1∣.

since 
z
=
x
+
i
y
z=x+iy, 
e
z
=
e
x
+
i
y
=
e
x
e
i
y
e 
z
 =e 
x+iy
 =e 
x
 e 
iy
 , so 
∣
e
z
∣
=
e
x
∣e 
z
 ∣=e 
x
 .

on 
∣
z
∣
=
30
∣z∣=30, 
∣
z
+
1
∣
≤
∣
z
∣
+
1
=
31
∣z+1∣≤∣z∣+1=31 by the triangle inequality.

also, 
x
x can range from 
−
30
−30 to 
30
30, since 
∣
z
∣
=
30
∣z∣=30.

so, 
∣
f
(
z
)
∣
=
e
x
⋅
∣
z
+
1
∣
≤
e
30
⋅
31
∣f(z)∣=e 
x
 ⋅∣z+1∣≤e 
30
 ⋅31.

on the other hand, 
∣
g
(
z
)
∣
=
∣
−
(
z
−
1
)
∣
=
∣
z
−
1
∣
≤
∣
z
∣
+
1
=
31
∣g(z)∣=∣−(z−1)∣=∣z−1∣≤∣z∣+1=31.

now, to apply rouché's theorem, i need 
∣
f
(
z
)
∣
>
∣
g
(
z
)
∣
∣f(z)∣>∣g(z)∣ on 
∣
z
∣
=
30
∣z∣=30.

given that 
e
30
⋅
31
e 
30
 ⋅31 is much larger than 31, this inequality holds.

therefore, by rouché's theorem, 
h
(
z
)
=
f
(
z
)
+
g
(
z
)
h(z)=f(z)+g(z) has the same number of zeros inside 
∣
z
∣
<
30
∣z∣<30 as 
f
(
z
)
f(z) does.

now, 
f
(
z
)
=
e
z
(
z
+
1
)
f(z)=e 
z
 (z+1).

the function 
e
z
e 
z
  is entire and has no zeros. the function 
z
+
1
z+1 has one zero at 
z
=
−
1
z=−1.

therefore, 
f
(
z
)
=
e
z
(
z
+
1
)
f(z)=e 
z
 (z+1) has one zero inside 
∣
z
∣
<
30
∣z∣<30.

wait, but 
e
z
e 
z
  never zero, so only 
z
+
1
z+1 contributes a zero.

therefore, by rouché's theorem, 
h
(
z
)
=
e
z
(
z
+
1
)
−
(
z
−
1
)
h(z)=e 
z
 (z+1)−(z−1) has one zero inside 
∣
z
∣
<
30
∣z∣<30.

but this seems off because the original equation is 
e
z
=
z
−
1
z
+
1
e 
z
 = 
z+1
z−1
​	
 , and considering the behavior of these functions, there might be more solutions.

perhaps i need to consider the argument principle or another approach.

alternatively, maybe i should consider the difference between the two sides of the equation.

let me define 
f
(
z
)
=
e
z
f(z)=e 
z
  and 
g
(
z
)
=
z
−
1
z
+
1
g(z)= 
z+1
z−1
​	
 , and look at 
f
(
z
)
−
g
(
z
)
=
0
f(z)−g(z)=0.

but to apply rouché's theorem, i need to have 
∣
f
(
z
)
∣
>
∣
g
(
z
)
∣
∣f(z)∣>∣g(z)∣ on 
∣
z
∣
=
30
∣z∣=30.

let me compute 
∣
f
(
z
)
∣
=
∣
e
z
∣
=
e
re
(
z
)
∣f(z)∣=∣e 
z
 ∣=e 
re(z)
 , and 
∣
g
(
z
)
∣
=
∣
z
−
1
z
+
1
∣
∣g(z)∣= 
​	
  
z+1
z−1
​	
  
​	
 .

on 
∣
z
∣
=
30
∣z∣=30, 
re
(
z
)
re(z) can range from 
−
30
−30 to 
30
30, so 
e
re
(
z
)
e 
re(z)
  ranges from 
e
−
30
e 
−30
  to 
e
30
e 
30
 .

this seems problematic because 
e
re
(
z
)
e 
re(z)
  can be very small or very large on the boundary.

perhaps rouché's theorem isn't the best approach here.

let me think differently. maybe i can consider the function 
e
z
(
z
+
1
)
z
−
1
=
1
z−1
e 
z
 (z+1)
​	
 =1, but that doesn't seem immediately helpful.

another approach: consider the equation 
e
z
=
z
−
1
z
+
1
e 
z
 = 
z+1
z−1
​	
  and take logarithms, but as i thought earlier, logarithms in the complex plane are multi-valued, so i have to be careful.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider writing 
e
z
=
z
−
1
z
+
1
e 
z
 = 
z+1
z−1
​	
  as 
e
z
(
z
+
1
)
=
z
−
1
e 
z
 (z+1)=z−1, and then rearrange to 
e
z
(
z
+
1
)
−
z
+
1
=
0
e 
z
 (z+1)−z+1=0, which is what i had before.

maybe i should look for solutions where 
z
z is real first, to get some intuition.

let's assume 
z
z is real and 
∣
z
∣
<
30
∣z∣<30.

then, the equation becomes 
e
z
=
z
−
1
z
+
1
e 
z
 = 
z+1
z−1
​	
 .

graphing both sides might give me an idea of how many real solutions there are.

but since i'm dealing with complex numbers, there might be infinitely many solutions, but the problem restricts 
∣
z
∣
<
30
∣z∣<30, so there should be a finite number.

wait, actually, in the complex plane, exponential functions are periodic, so there might be infinitely many solutions in the entire plane, but within a bounded region, there should be finitely many.

maybe i can consider the argument of both sides.

let me write 
e
z
=
e
x
+
i
y
=
e
x
e
i
y
e 
z
 =e 
x+iy
 =e 
x
 e 
iy
 , and 
z
−
1
z
+
1
z+1
z−1
​	
  can be expressed in terms of its magnitude and argument.

but this seems complicated.

perhaps another strategy: use the fact that 
e
z
e 
z
  is entire and 
z
−
1
z
+
1
z+1
z−1
​	
  has a pole at 
z
=
−
1
z=−1, but inside 
∣
z
∣
<
30
∣z∣<30, so i need to consider that.

alternatively, maybe i can look at the function 
e
z
(
z
+
1
)
z
−
1
−
1
=
0
z−1
e 
z
 (z+1)
​	
 −1=0, but again, not sure.

wait, maybe i can consider the laurent series expansion or something similar, but that might not be straightforward.

let me try to estimate the number of zeros using the argument principle.

the argument principle states that the number of zeros minus the number of poles of a meromorphic function inside a contour is equal to the change in the argument of the function divided by 
2
π
2π as we traverse the contour.

in this case, my function is 
h
(
z
)
=
e
z
(
z
+
1
)
−
(
z
−
1
)
h(z)=e 
z
 (z+1)−(z−1), which is entire, so there are no poles, and the number of zeros inside 
∣
z
∣
<
30
∣z∣<30 is equal to the change in the argument of 
h
(
z
)
h(z) divided by 
2
π
2π as 
z
z traverses 
∣
z
∣
=
30
∣z∣=30.

but calculating the change in argument directly seems difficult.

maybe i need to consider asymptotic behavior or other properties of the function.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the inverse function or look for fixed points.

wait, let's consider the equation 
e
z
=
z
−
1
z
+
1
e 
z
 = 
z+1
z−1
​	
 .

i can rewrite this as:

e
z
(
z
+
1
)
=
z
−
1
e 
z
 (z+1)=z−1
which leads to:

e
z
z
+
e
z
=
z
−
1
e 
z
 z+e 
z
 =z−1
rearranging:

e
z
z
−
z
=
−
e
z
−
1
e 
z
 z−z=−e 
z
 −1
factor 
z
z on the left:

z
(
e
z
−
1
)
=
−
(
e
z
+
1
)
z(e 
z
 −1)=−(e 
z
 +1)
so,

z
=
−
e
z
+
1
e
z
−
1
z=− 
e 
z
 −1
e 
z
 +1
​	
 
hmm, interesting. this expresses 
z
z in terms of 
e
z
e 
z
 , but it's still not clear how to find the number of solutions.

maybe i can consider the function 
f
(
z
)
=
z
(
e
z
−
1
)
+
e
z
+
1
=
0
f(z)=z(e 
z
 −1)+e 
z
 +1=0, but again, not sure.

let me try a different approach. perhaps consider the function 
z
−
1
z
+
1
z+1
z−1
​	
  and see its behavior.

the function 
z
−
1
z
+
1
z+1
z−1
​	
  is a möbius transformation, which maps the complex plane minus 
z
=
−
1
z=−1 to itself.

the exponential function 
e
z
e 
z
  is periodic with period 
2
π
i
2πi, and it's entire.

perhaps the equation 
e
z
=
z
−
1
z
+
1
e 
z
 = 
z+1
z−1
​	
  has solutions that are spaced periodically in the imaginary direction.

if that's the case, then within a vertical strip of height 
2
π
2π, there might be a certain number of solutions, and then i can count how many such strips fit into the disk 
∣
z
∣
<
30
∣z∣<30.

but i need to make this more precise.

let me consider writing 
z
=
x
+
i
y
z=x+iy, where 
x
x and 
y
y are real numbers.

then, 
e
z
=
e
x
+
i
y
=
e
x
(
cos
⁡
y

i
sin
⁡
y
)
e 
z
 =e

 =e

 (cosy+isiny), and 
z
−

z

(
x
+
1
)
+
i
y
z+1
z−1
​	
 = 
(x+1)+iy
(x−1)+iy
​	
 .

to solve 
e
z
=
z
−
1
z
+
1
e 
z
 = 
z+1
z−1
​	
 , i can set the real and imaginary parts equal.

this seems messy, but perhaps manageable.

first, compute 
z
−

z

z+1
z−1
​	
 :

z

simplifying the numerator:

so,

this gives me two equations to solve simultaneously for

this seems complicated, but maybe i can find some symmetry or make some substitutions.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the magnitude of both sides.

the magnitude of

so,

so,

2
 +y

​	
 
(x−1) 
2
 +y

​	
 
​	
 .

this gives me one equation involving 
x
x and 
y
y.

additionally, the argument of 
e
z
e 
z
  is 
y
y, and the argument of 
z

  is 
arctan

arctan(

​	
 ), assuming 
x

y

so,

​	
 )+2πk, where 
k
k is an integer, due to the periodicity of the argument.

this seems even more complicated.

maybe there's a better approach.

let me consider the original equation again:

e
z
=
z
−
1
z
+
1
e 
z
 = 
z+1
z−1
​	
 
i can rewrite this as:

e
z
(
z

)
=
z
−
1
e 
z
 (z+1)=z−1
then,

e
z
z
+
e
z
=
z
−
1
e 
z
 z+e 
z
 =z−1
rearranging:

e
z
z
−
z
=
−
e
z
−

e 
z
 z−z=−e 
z

factor 
z
z on the left:

z
(
e
z
−

)
=
−
(
e
z

)
z(e 
z
 −1)=−(e 
z

so,

z
=
−
e
z
+
1
e
z
−
1
z=− 
e 
z
 −1
e 
z
 +1
​	
 
this expression seems familiar; it resembles the definition of the hyperbolic cotangent function, but i'm not sure if that's helpful here.

alternatively, maybe i can consider the lambert w function, which is used to solve equations of the form 
z
e
z
=
k
ze 
z
 =k, but i'm not sure if that directly applies here.

wait a minute, perhaps i can manipulate the equation to resemble the standard lambert w form.

starting from:

e
z
(
z
+
1
)
=
z
−
1
e 
z
 (z+1)=z−1
let me set 
w
=
z
+
1
w=z+1, so 
z
=
w
−
1
z=w−1. substituting:

e
w
−
1
(
w
)
=
(
w
−
1
)
−
1
=
w
−
2
e 
w−1
 (w)=(w−1)−1=w−2
so,

e
w
−
1
w
=
w
−
2
e 
w−1
 w=w−2
which can be written as:

w
e
w
−
1
=
w
−
2
we 
w−1
 =w−2
this still doesn't look like the standard lambert w form, which is 
w
e
w
=
k
we 
w
 =k. maybe this substitution isn't helpful.

perhaps i need to think about the zeros of the function 
h
(
z
)
=
e
z
(
z
+
1
)
−
(
z
−
1
)
h(z)=e 
z
 (z+1)−(z−1).

to find the number of zeros of 
h
(
z
)
h(z) inside 
∣
z
∣
<
30
∣z∣<30, i might need to use the argument principle, which involves integrating 
h
′
(
z
)
h
(
z
)
h(z)
h 
′
 (z)
​	
  around the contour 
∣
z
∣
=
30
∣z∣=30 and counting the number of times the argument changes.

however, computing this integral directly seems quite involved.

another idea: since 
e
z
e 
z
  has an essential singularity at infinity and 
z
−
1
z
+
1
z+1
z−1
​	
  is meromorphic, perhaps i can consider the behavior at infinity to estimate the number of zeros.

alternatively, maybe i can consider the function 
f
(
z
)
=
e
z
−
z
−
1
z
+
1
f(z)=e 
z
 − 
z+1
z−1
​	
  and look for its zeros.

but again, this seems similar to what i've already done.

let me try to consider the series expansion of 
e
z
e 
z
  and see if that helps.

the taylor series of 
e
z
e 
z
  around 
z
=
0
z=0 is:

e
z
=
1
+
z
+
z
2
2
!
+
z
3
3
!
+
⋯
e 
z
 =1+z+ 
2!
z 
2
 
​	
 + 
3!
z 
3
 
​	
 +⋯
and 
z
−
1
z
+
1
=
1
−
2
z
+
1
z+1
z−1
​	
 =1− 
z+1
2
​	
 

but i'm not sure how to reconcile these series to find the zeros.

perhaps another approach: consider the function 
e
z
(
z
+
1
)
z
−
1
z−1
e 
z
 (z+1)
​	
  and see if i can find its fixed points or something similar.

wait, maybe i should consider the function 
f
(
z
)
=
e
z
(
z
+
1
)
f(z)=e 
z
 (z+1) and 
g
(
z
)
=
z
−
1
g(z)=z−1, and see where they intersect.

but i think i'm going in circles here.

let me try to think about the growth of 
e
z
e 
z
  and 
z
−
1
z
+
1
z+1
z−1
​	
  as 
∣
z
∣
∣z∣ increases.

the function 
e
z
e 
z
  grows exponentially in the right half-plane and decays exponentially in the left half-plane.

on the other hand, 
z
−
1
z
+
1
z+1
z−1
​	
  behaves like 1 for large 
∣
z
∣
∣z∣, since the numerator and denominator are both linear in 
z
z.

so, for large 
∣
z
∣
∣z∣, 
e
z
e 
z
  dominates in the right half-plane, while 
z
−
1
z
+
1
z+1
z−1
​	
  approaches 1.

this suggests that solutions might be clustered in certain regions of the complex plane.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the function 
e
z
(
z
+
1
)
z
−
1
z−1
e 
z
 (z+1)
​	
  and look for its fixed points where it equals 1.

but this seems similar to what i've already considered.

another thought: maybe i can consider the function 
log
⁡
(
z
−
1
z
+
1
)
log( 
z+1
z−1
​	
 ), but as i mentioned earlier, the logarithm is multi-valued in the complex plane, which complicates things.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the inverse function, but that also seems non-trivial.

let me try to see if there are any obvious solutions.

for example, if 
z
=
0
z=0, then 
e
0
=
1
e 
0
 =1 and 
0
−
1
0
+
1
=
−
1
0+1
0−1
​	
 =−1, so 
1
≠
−
1
1

=−1, not a solution.

if 
z
=
1
z=1, then 
e
1
=
e
e 
1
 =e and 
1
−
1
1
+
1
=
0
1+1
1−1
​	
 =0, so 
e
≠
0
e

=0, not a solution.

if 
z
=
−
1
z=−1, the denominator becomes zero, so it's not in the domain.

maybe try 
z
=
i
z=i, then 
e
i
=
cos
⁡
1
+
i
sin
⁡
1
e 
i
 =cos1+isin1, and 
i
−
1
i
+
1
=
(
i
−
1
)
(
1
−
i
)
(
1
+
i
)
(
1
−
i
)
=
2
i
2
=
i
i+1
i−1
​	
 = 
(1+i)(1−i)
(i−1)(1−i)
​	
 = 
2
2i
​	
 =i, so 
e
i
≈
0.5403
+
0.8415
i
e 
i
 ≈0.5403+0.8415i, which is not equal to 
i
i, so not a solution.

hmm, not helpful.

perhaps i need to accept that finding exact solutions is too difficult and instead focus on estimating the number of solutions within 
∣
z
∣
<
30
∣z∣<30.

given that 
e
z
e 
z
  has an essential singularity at infinity and is of exponential type, while 
z
−
1
z
+
1
z+1
z−1
​	
  is a rational function, i might expect that the equation 
e
z
=
z
−
1
z
+
1
e 
z
 = 
z+1
z−1
​	
  has infinitely many solutions in the entire complex plane, but within the disk 
∣
z
∣
<
30
∣z∣<30, there should be finitely many solutions.

to find the exact number, perhaps i can use the argument principle or some other counting theorem.

let me recall the argument principle more carefully.

the number of zeros of a function 
h
(
z
)
h(z) inside a contour 
c
c is given by:

1
2
π
i
∮
c
h
′
(
z
)
h
(
z
)
 
d
z
2πi
1
​	
 ∮ 
c
​	
  
h(z)
h 
′
 (z)
​	
 dz
but computing this integral directly for 
h
(
z
)
=
e
z
(
z
+
1
)
−
(
z
−
1
)
h(z)=e 
z
 (z+1)−(z−1) seems too complicated.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the function 
f
(
z
)
=
e
z
(
z
+
1
)
f(z)=e 
z
 (z+1) and 
g
(
z
)
=
z
−
1
g(z)=z−1, and see if rouché's theorem can be applied in a different way.

wait, perhaps i can consider 
f
(
z
)
=
e
z
(
z
+
1
)
f(z)=e 
z
 (z+1) and 
g
(
z
)
=
z
−
1
g(z)=z−1, and check on 
∣
z
∣
=
30
∣z∣=30 whether 
∣
f
(
z
)
∣
>
∣
g
(
z
)
∣
∣f(z)∣>∣g(z)∣.

as before, 
∣
f
(
z
)
∣
=
e
re
(
z
)
⋅
∣
z
+
1
∣
∣f(z)∣=e 
re(z)
 ⋅∣z+1∣, and 
∣
g
(
z
)
∣
=
∣
z
−
1
∣
∣g(z)∣=∣z−1∣.

on 
∣
z
∣
=
30
∣z∣=30, 
re
(
z
)
re(z) can be as large as 30 or as small as -30.

if 
re
(
z
)
re(z) is large and positive, 
e
re
(
z
)
e 
re(z)
  is huge, so 
∣
f
(
z
)
∣
∣f(z)∣ dominates.

if 
re
(
z
)
re(z) is negative, 
e
re
(
z
)
e 
re(z)
  is very small.

so, on parts of the contour where 
re
(
z
)
re(z) is large, 
∣
f
(
z
)
∣
>
∣
g
(
z
)
∣
∣f(z)∣>∣g(z)∣, but not necessarily everywhere.

this suggests that rouché's theorem might not directly apply, or at least not in a straightforward way.

alternatively, perhaps i can deform the contour to a region where rouché's theorem is applicable.

but this seems complicated.

maybe i should consider the function 
h
(
z
)
=
e
z
(
z
+
1
)
−
(
z
−
1
)
h(z)=e 
z
 (z+1)−(z−1) and see its behavior along the real and imaginary axes.

for example, along the real axis, 
z
=
x
z=x, and i can analyze 
h
(
x
)
=
e
x
(
x
+
1
)
−
(
x
−
1
)
h(x)=e 
x
 (x+1)−(x−1).

similarly, along the imaginary axis, 
z
=
i
y
z=iy, and 
h
(
i
y
)
=
e
i
y
(
i
y
+
1
)
−
(
i
y
−
1
)
h(iy)=e 
iy
 (iy+1)−(iy−1).

but this might not lead me directly to the number of zeros.

perhaps i need to accept that this problem is beyond my current understanding and look for hints or similar problems.

alternatively, maybe i can consider numerical methods or graphical analysis to estimate the number of solutions, but since this is a theoretical problem, i should aim for an exact answer.

another idea: maybe i can consider the infinite product representation of 
e
z
e 
z
  or other functions involved, but that seems unlikely to help directly.

wait, perhaps i can consider the function 
e
z
(
z
+
1
)
z
−
1
z−1
e 
z
 (z+1)
​	
  and look for its fixed points where it equals 1.

but again, this seems similar to earlier approaches.

let me consider the asymptotic behavior of 
e
z
e 
z
  and 
z
−
1
z
+
1
z+1
z−1
​	
 .

as 
∣
z
∣
∣z∣ approaches infinity, 
e
z
e 
z
  grows rapidly in certain directions and decays in others, while 
z
−
1
z
+
1
z+1
z−1
​	
  approaches 1.

this suggests that for large 
∣
z
∣
∣z∣, the equation 
e
z
=
z
−
1
z
+
1
e 
z
 = 
z+1
z−1
​	
  might have solutions where 
e
z
e 
z
  is close to 1, which happens periodically in the imaginary direction.

specifically, 
e
z
=
1
e 
z
 =1 when 
z
=
2
π
i
k
z=2πik for integer 
k
k.

so, near these points, 
e
z
e 
z
  is close to 1, and 
z
−
1
z
+
1
z+1
z−1
​	
  is also close to 1, so there might be solutions near these points.

this suggests that there could be solutions spaced approximately 
2
π
2π apart in the imaginary direction.

if that's the case, then within a vertical strip of height 
2
π
2π, there might be one solution, and then i can count how many such strips fit into the disk 
∣
z
∣
<
30
∣z∣<30.

but i need to make this more precise.

first, the disk 
∣
z
∣
<
30
∣z∣<30 includes all 
z
=
x
+
i
y
z=x+iy with 
x
2
+
y
2
<
900
x 
2
 +y 
2
 <900.

so, the imaginary part 
y
y can range from 
−
30
−30 to 
30
30.

if solutions are spaced approximately 
2
π
2π apart in the imaginary direction, then the number of such strips is roughly 
60
2
π
2π
60
​	
 , since 
y
y ranges from 
−
30
−30 to 
30
30, a total height of 60.

calculating 
60
2
π
≈
60
6.283
≈
9.549
2π
60
​	
 ≈ 
6.283
60
​	
 ≈9.549.

since the number of solutions should be an integer, perhaps there are 10 solutions in this region.

but this is just an estimate; i need a more accurate method.

alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of times the imaginary part 
y
y increases by 
2
π
2π within the disk.

given that 
y
y ranges from 
−
30
−30 to 
30
30, the number of such intervals is 
60
2
π
2π
60
​	
 , which is approximately 9.549, as before.

rounding to the nearest integer, it would be 10 solutions.

but i need to confirm this.

alternatively, maybe i should consider that for each 
k
∈
z
k∈z, there is a solution near 
z
=
2
π
i
k
z=2πik, and see how many such 
k
k satisfy 
∣
2
π
i
k
∣
<
30
∣2πik∣<30.

since 
∣
2
π
i
k
∣
=
2
π
∣
k
∣
∣2πik∣=2π∣k∣, we have 
2
π
∣
k
∣
<
30
2π∣k∣<30, which implies 
∣
k
∣
<
30
2
π
≈
4.7746
∣k∣< 
2π
30
​	
 ≈4.7746.

therefore, 
k
k can be 
−
4
,
−
3
,
−
2
,
−
1
,
0
,
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
−4,−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3,4, which gives 9 possible integer values for 
k
k, suggesting 9 solutions.

but earlier estimation suggested about 10 solutions, so there's some inconsistency here.

perhaps the solutions are not exactly at 
z
=
2
π
i
k
z=2πik, but near those points.

given that, maybe there are 9 or 10 solutions within 
∣
z
∣
<
30
∣z∣<30.

but this is not precise.

alternatively, perhaps there are 10 solutions, considering both positive and negative 
k
k, and including 
k
=
0
k=0.

but again, this is speculative.

maybe i need to consider that the disk 
∣
z
∣
<
30
∣z∣<30 includes solutions for 
k
=
−
4
,
−
3
,
−
2
,
−
1
,
0
,
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
k=−4,−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3,4, which is 9 solutions, but perhaps there's an additional solution near the origin or somewhere else.

alternatively, perhaps there are 10 solutions because 
k
=
−
4
k=−4 to 
k
=
4
k=4 gives 9 solutions, and there's an additional solution elsewhere within the disk.

but this is just guessing.

alternatively, maybe the number of solutions is equal to the number of times 
y
y increases by 
2
π
2π within the disk, which is 
⌊
30
π
⌋
⌊ 
π
30
​	
 ⌋, but 
30
π
≈
9.549
π
30
​	
 ≈9.549, so floor is 9, but that doesn't account for negative 
y
y.

alternatively, 
⌊
30
π
⌋
=
9
⌊ 
π
30
​	
 ⌋=9, and since 
y
y can be both positive and negative, perhaps 
2
×
9
=
18
2×9=18, but that seems too high.

wait, no, because 
z
=
2
π
i
k
z=2πik already includes both positive and negative 
k
k.

so, perhaps there are 9 solutions within 
∣
z
∣
<
30
∣z∣<30.

but i'm not entirely confident in this conclusion.

perhaps i need to consider the exact number of zeros using a more precise method.

alternatively, maybe i can consider that the exponential function 
e
z
e 
z
  has a period of 
2
π
i
2πi, and within each horizontal strip of height 
2
π
2π, there is one solution.

given that, the number of such strips within 
∣
z
∣
<
30
∣z∣<30 is approximately 
60
2
π
≈
9.549
2π
60

 ≈9.549, which suggests around 10 solutions.
