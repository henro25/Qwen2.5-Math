Reasoning: So i've got this probability problem here. it says, "ten standard 6-sided dice are rolled. what is the probability that exactly one of the dice shows a 1?" and i need to express the answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest thousandth. alright, let's break this down.

first off, i know that a standard die has six faces, numbered from 1 to 6. so, when we roll one die, the probability of getting a 1 is 1 out of 6, which is 
1
6
6
1
​	
 , and the probability of not getting a 1 is 
5
6
6
5
​	
 .

now, we're rolling ten dice, and we want exactly one of them to show a 1. this sounds like a binomial probability problem because we have a fixed number of trials (10 dice), each with two possible outcomes (either it's a 1 or it's not), and the trials are independent.

in binomial probability, the formula to find the probability of getting exactly 
k
k successes in 
n
n trials is:

p
(
k
)
=
c
(
n
,
k
)
×
p
k
×
(
1
−
p
)
n
−
k
p(k)=c(n,k)×p 
k
 ×(1−p) 
n−k
 
where:

- 
c
(
n
,
k
)
c(n,k) is the combination of 
n
n things taken 
k
k at a time.

- 
p
p is the probability of success on a single trial.

- 
1
−
p
1−p is the probability of failure on a single trial.

in this problem:

- 
n
=
10
n=10 (since we're rolling 10 dice)

- 
k
=
1
k=1 (we want exactly one die to show a 1)

- 
p
=
1
6
p= 
6
1
​	
  (probability of rolling a 1)

- 
1
−
p
=
5
6
1−p= 
6
5
​	
  (probability of not rolling a 1)

so, plugging these values into the formula:

p
(
1
)
=
c
(
10
,
1
)
×
(
1
6
)
1
×
(
5
6
)
9
p(1)=c(10,1)×( 
6
1
​	
 ) 
1
 ×( 
6
5
​	
 ) 
9
 
now, i need to calculate 
c
(
10
,
1
)
c(10,1). i recall that 
c
(
n
,
k
)
c(n,k) is calculated as:

c
(
n
,
k
)
=
n
!
k
!
(
n
−
k
)
!
c(n,k)= 
k!(n−k)!
n!
​	
 
so, for 
c
(
10
,
1
)
c(10,1):

c
(
10
,
1
)
=
10
!
1
!
(
10
−
1
)
!
=
10
!
1
!
×
9
!
=
10
×
9
!
1
×
9
!
=
10
c(10,1)= 
1!(10−1)!
10!
​	
 = 
1!×9!
10!
​	
 = 
1×9!
10×9!
​	
 =10
okay, so 
c
(
10
,
1
)
=
10
c(10,1)=10.

next, 
(
1
6
)
1
=
1
6
( 
6
1
​	
 ) 
1
 = 
6
1
​	
 .

and 
(
5
6
)
9
( 
6
5
​	
 ) 
9
  is 
(
5
6
)
( 
6
5
​	
 ) raised to the 9th power.

so, putting it all together:

p
(
1
)
=
10

(
5

)

p(1)=10×

now, i need to compute 
(

 )

 . this seems a bit tricky without a calculator, but i can approximate it or use logarithms, but since the problem asks for a decimal rounded to the nearest thousandth, i should probably use a calculator for accuracy.

let me calculate

)
9
≈

(

​

 ≈0.193429

now, plugging back into the equation:

​	
 ≈0.166666, right? so, 10 times 0.166666 is approximately 1.66666.

then, 1.66666 times 0.193429.

let's calculate that:

1.66666 * 0.193429

first, 1 * 0.193429 = 0.193429

0.66666 * 0.193429

0.6 * 0.193429 = 0.1160574

0.06666 * 0.193429 ≈ 0.012889

so, total is approximately 0.193429 + 0.1160574 + 0.012889 ≈ 0.3223754

so, p(1) ≈ 0.3223754

now, the problem asks for the probability rounded to the nearest thousandth, which is three decimal places.

so, 0.3223754 rounds to 0.322.

wait, but let's double-check my calculations because sometimes when you do it manually, you can make mistakes.

alternatively, maybe there's a better way to calculate this.

alternatively, perhaps using the exact values.

let's see.

we have:

p(1) = 10 * (1/6) * (5/6)^9

we can calculate (5/6)^9 exactly.

but that might be time-consuming without a calculator.

alternatively, maybe use logarithms.

but that's probably more complicated.

alternatively, maybe use the binomial probability formula directly with a calculator.

assuming i have a calculator, i can calculate (5/6)^9.

let me see:

(5/6) = 0.833333...

0.833333^9.

alternatively, using a calculator, 0.833333^9 is approximately 0.1934515.

then, p(1) = 10 * (1/6) * 0.1934515

1/6 is approximately 0.1666667.

so, 10 * 0.1666667 = 1.6666667

then, 1.6666667 * 0.1934515 ≈ 0.322419

rounded to the nearest thousandth is 0.322.

wait, earlier i got 0.3223754, which also rounds to 0.322.

but let's confirm if this is correct.

alternatively, perhaps i should consider that the exact value is different.

alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approximate this.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the natural logarithm to calculate (5/6)^9.

ln(5/6) = ln(5) - ln(6)

ln(5) ≈ 1.6094379

ln(6) ≈ 1.7917595

so, ln(5/6) ≈ 1.6094379 - 1.7917595 = -0.1823216

then, (5/6)^9 = e^(9 * ln(5/6)) = e^(-0.1823216 * 9) = e^(-1.6408944)

now, e^(-1.6408944) ≈ ?

we know that e^(-1) ≈ 0.3678794

e^(-0.6408944) ≈ ?

wait, this seems more complicated.

alternatively, perhaps it's better to accept that with manual calculations, it's error-prone, and just stick with the approximate value i have.

alternatively, perhaps i can think of it differently.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the fact that the probability is 10 * (1/6) * (5/6)^9.

alternatively, perhaps i can recognize that this is a standard binomial probability calculation, and accept that the approximate value is 0.322.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that with 10 dice, the expected number of 1's is 10 * (1/6) ≈ 1.6667, which is higher than 1, so getting exactly one 1 is less than the expected value, but still significant.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that the probability should be around 0.322.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the complement rule or something, but that seems unnecessary here.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that the exact value is 10 * (1/6) * (5/6)^9.

calculating this exactly:

first, 5^9 = 1953125

6^9 = 10077696

so, (5/6)^9 = 1953125 / 10077696

then, p(1) = 10 * (1/6) * (1953125 / 10077696)

simplify:

10 * (1/6) = 10/6 = 5/3

so, p(1) = (5/3) * (1953125 / 10077696) = (5 * 1953125) / (3 * 10077696)

calculate numerator: 5 * 1953125 = 9,765,625

denominator: 3 * 10,077,696 = 30,233,088

so, p(1) = 9,765,625 / 30,233,088

now, divide 9,765,625 by 30,233,088.

let's see:

30,233,088 divided by 9,765,625 is approximately 3.09375

wait, no, actually, 9,765,625 divided by 30,233,088 is approximately 0.322.

yes, 9,765,625 / 30,233,088 ≈ 0.322.

so, p(1) ≈ 0.322.

therefore, the probability is approximately 0.322.

so, the final answer is 0.322.

**final answer**

0.322
