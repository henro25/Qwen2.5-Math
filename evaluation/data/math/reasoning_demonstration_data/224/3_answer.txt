Answer: To find the minimum value of the expression \( x^2 + y^2 - 6x + 4y + 18 \) for real \( x \) and \( y \), we can complete the square for both \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

first, complete the square for the \( x \)-terms:
\[
x^2 - 6x = (x - 3)^2 - 9
\]

next, complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[
y^2 + 4y = (y + 2)^2 - 4
\]

substitute these back into the original expression:
\[
x^2 + y^2 - 6x + 4y + 18 = (x - 3)^2 - 9 + (y + 2)^2 - 4 + 18
\]

simplify the constants:
\[
(x - 3)^2 + (y + 2)^2 - 9 - 4 + 18 = (x - 3)^2 + (y + 2)^2 + 5
\]

since squares are always non-negative, the smallest value \( (x - 3)^2 + (y + 2)^2 \) can take is 0, which happens when \( x = 3 \) and \( y = -2 \). therefore, the minimum value of the entire expression is:
\[
0 + 5 = 5
\]

to confirm, we can use calculus. the partial derivatives are:
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(x^2 + y^2 - 6x + 4y + 18) = 2x - 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(x^2 + y^2 - 6x + 4y + 18) = 2y + 4
\]

setting these to zero gives:
\[
2x - 6 = 0 \implies x = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad 2y + 4 = 0 \implies y = -2
\]

the hessian matrix is:
\[
h = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & 0 \\
0 & 2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

the determinant of the hessian is \( 4 \), which is positive, and since \( \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} > 0 \), this critical point is a local minimum.

thus, the minimum value of the expression is indeed:
\[
\boxed{5}
