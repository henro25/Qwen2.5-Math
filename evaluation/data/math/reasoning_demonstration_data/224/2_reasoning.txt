Reasoning: I've got this problem here: i need to find the minimum value of the expression 
x
2
+
y
2
−
6
x
+
4
y
+
18
x 
2
 +y 
2
 −6x+4y+18 where 
x
x and 
y
y are real numbers. okay, let's see how to approach this.

first off, this looks like a quadratic expression in two variables, 
x
x and 
y
y. i remember that quadratic expressions can often be minimized or maximized by completing the square or by using calculus, like taking partial derivatives and setting them to zero. since this is a problem for real numbers, and it's a quadratic, i think completing the square might be a good way to go.

let me try completing the square for both 
x
x and 
y
y separately.

starting with the 
x
x-terms: 
x
2
−
6
x
x 
2
 −6x. to complete the square, i take half of the coefficient of 
x
x, which is 
−
6
−6, so half of that is 
−
3
−3, and then square it to get 
9
9. so, 
x
2
−
6
x
=
(
x
−
3
)
2
−
9
x 
2
 −6x=(x−3) 
2
 −9.

now for the 
y
y-terms: 
y
2
+
4
y
y 
2
 +4y. half of 
4
4 is 
2
2, and squaring that gives 
4
4. so, 
y
2
+
4
y
=
(
y
+
2
)
2
−
4
y 
2
 +4y=(y+2) 
2
 −4.

now, substitute these back into the original expression:

x
2
+
y
2
−
6
x
+
4
y
+
18
=
(
x
−
3
)
2
−
9
+
(
y
+
2
)
2
−
4
+
18
x 
2
 +y 
2
 −6x+4y+18=(x−3) 
2
 −9+(y+2) 
2
 −4+18
simplify the constants:

(
x
−
3
)
2
+
(
y
+
2
)
2
−
9
−
4
+
18
=
(
x
−
3
)
2
+
(
y
+
2
)
2
+
5
(x−3) 
2
 +(y+2) 
2
 −9−4+18=(x−3) 
2
 +(y+2) 
2
 +5
so, the expression simplifies to 
(
x
−
3
)
2
+
(
y
+
2
)
2
+
5
(x−3) 
2
 +(y+2) 
2
 +5.

now, since squares are always non-negative, the smallest value 
(
x
−
3
)
2
+
(
y
+
2
)
2
(x−3) 
2
 +(y+2) 
2
  can take is 0, which happens when 
x
−
3
=
0
x−3=0 and 
y
+
2
=
0
y+2=0, so 
x
=
3
x=3 and 
y
=
−
2
y=−2.

therefore, the minimum value of the entire expression is 
0
+
5
=
5
0+5=5.

wait a second, is there another way to confirm this? maybe using calculus. let's try taking partial derivatives and setting them to zero to find critical points.

first, find the partial derivative with respect to 
x
x:

∂
∂
x
(
x
2
+
y
2
−
6
x
+
4
y
+
18
)
=
2
x
−
6
∂x
∂
​
 (x 
2
 +y 
2
 −6x+4y+18)=2x−6
set this equal to zero:

2
x
−
6
=
0
  
⟹
  
x
=
3
2x−6=0⟹x=3
now, the partial derivative with respect to 
y
y:

∂
∂
y
(
x
2
+
y
2
−
6
x
+
4
y
+
18
)
=
2
y
+
4
∂y
∂
​
 (x 
2
 +y 
2
 −6x+4y+18)=2y+4
set this equal to zero:

2
y
+
4
=
0
  
⟹
  
y
=
−
2
2y+4=0⟹y=−2
so, the critical point is at 
(
3
,
−
2
)
(3,−2), which matches what i got from completing the square. now, to confirm that this is indeed a minimum, i can check the second partial derivatives.

the second partial derivatives are:

∂
2
∂
x
2
=
2
,
∂
2
∂
y
2
=
2
,
∂
2
∂
x
∂
y
=
0
∂x 
2
 
∂ 
2
 
​
 =2, 
∂y 
2
 
∂ 
2
 
​
 =2, 
∂x∂y
∂ 
2
 
​
 =0
the hessian matrix is:

h
=
[
2
0
0
2
]
h=[ 
2
0
​
  
0
2
​
 ]
the determinant of the hessian is 
(
2
)
(
2
)
−
(
0
)
2
=
4
(2)(2)−(0) 
2
 =4, which is positive, and since 
∂
2
∂
x
2
>
0
∂x 
2
 
∂ 
2
 
​
 >0, this critical point is a local minimum.

therefore, the minimum value of the expression is indeed 
5
5, occurring at 
(
3
,
−
2
)
(3,−2).

is there any other method i could use to solve this? maybe by treating it as a quadratic form or using vectors? well, since it's a simple quadratic in two variables, completing the square or using calculus seems sufficient.

alternatively, i could think of this expression as the equation of a circle or something similar, but i think that might be overcomplicating it.

another way: maybe i can think of 
x
2
+
y
2
−
6
x
+
4
y
+
18
x 
2
 +y 
2
 −6x+4y+18 as the distance squared from a point to another point, but with some adjustments.

wait, actually, in geometry, the expression 
(
x
−
a
)
2
+
(
y
−
b
)
2
(x−a) 
2
 +(y−b) 
2
  represents the square of the distance from the point 
(
x
,
y
)
(x,y) to the point 
(
a
,
b
)
(a,b). so, in this case, after completing the square, i have 
(
x
−
3
)
2
+
(
y
+
2
)
2
+
5
(x−3) 
2
 +(y+2) 
2
 +5, which suggests that the expression represents the square of the distance from 
(
x
,
y
)
(x,y) to 
(
3
,
−
2
)
(3,−2), plus 5.

since the smallest distance squared is 0 (when 
x
=
3
x=3, 
y
=
−
2
y=−2), the smallest value of the entire expression is 5.

so, yes, all methods point to the minimum value being 5.

i think i've covered the necessary steps and verified the answer through multiple approaches. i'm confident that the minimum value is indeed 5.

**final answer**
