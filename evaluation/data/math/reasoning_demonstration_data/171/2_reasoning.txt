Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: if v cross w is equal to the vector (5, -2, 4), then i need to find (v + w) cross (v + w). hmm, cross product of two vectors... i remember that the cross product of two vectors results in another vector that's perpendicular to both of them, and its magnitude is related to the area of the parallelogram they form.

first, i need to recall the properties of the cross product. i know that the cross product is anti-commutative, meaning that v cross w is equal to the negative of w cross v. also, there's the distributive property over addition, so maybe i can expand (v + w) cross (v + w) using that.

let me try expanding it:

(v + w) cross (v + w) = v cross v + v cross w + w cross v + w cross w.

wait a minute, what's v cross v? i think that's zero because the cross product of any vector with itself is zero. similarly, w cross w should also be zero for the same reason. so that simplifies the expression to:

(v + w) cross (v + w) = v cross w + w cross v.

but i also know that w cross v is equal to - (v cross w), because of the anti-commutative property. so substituting that in:

(v + w) cross (v + w) = v cross w - v cross w.

which simplifies to zero.

so, does that mean that (v + w) cross (v + w) is just the zero vector?

wait, that seems too straightforward. let me check if there's another way to look at this.

i recall that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero. so, (v + w) cross (v + w) should indeed be zero, because it's just the cross product of the same vector with itself.

let me confirm this with an example. suppose v is (1, 0, 0) and w is (0, 1, 0). then v cross w is (0, 0, 1). now, v + w is (1, 1, 0). the cross product of (1, 1, 0) with itself is (0, 0, 0), which is the zero vector. so, in this case, it works.

another example: let v be (2, 3, 4) and w be (5, 6, 7). then v cross w would be calculated as:

|i j k |

|2 3 4|

|5 6 7|

which is i*(3*7 - 4*6) - j*(2*7 - 4*5) + k*(2*6 - 3*5) = i*(21 - 24) - j*(14 - 20) + k*(12 - 15) = (-3, 6, -3).

now, v + w is (7, 9, 11). the cross product of (7, 9, 11) with itself is zero, as expected.

so, it seems consistent that (v + w) cross (v + w) is always the zero vector, regardless of what v and w are, as long as they are vectors in three-dimensional space.

therefore, the answer should be the zero vector.

but wait, the problem gives a specific cross product of v and w, which is (5, -2, 4). does this affect the result?

well, based on the properties of the cross product, it shouldn't matter what v cross w is; the cross product of any vector with itself is zero. so, even if v cross w is given, (v + w) cross (v + w) should still be zero.

let me see if there's another interpretation. maybe the problem is testing if i know that the cross product of a vector with itself is zero, regardless of what its cross product with another vector is.

alternatively, could there be a scenario where (v + w) cross (v + w) is not zero? well, in standard vector algebra, that's not possible. the cross product of any vector with itself is always zero.

so, i'm pretty confident that the answer is the zero vector.
