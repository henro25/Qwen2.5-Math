Answer: To solve the problem, we need to find a number \( x \) that can be added to both the numerator and denominator of the fraction \(\frac{3}{5}\) such that the resulting fraction is equal to \(\frac{5}{6}\).

1. **Set up the equation:**
   \[
   \frac{3 + x}{5 + x} = \frac{5}{6}
   \]

2. **Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:**
   \[
   6(3 + x) = 5(5 + x)
   \]
   Simplify both sides:
   \[
   18 + 6x = 25 + 5x
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   18 + 6x - 5x = 25
   \]
   \[
   18 + x = 25
   \]
   \[
   x = 25 - 18
   \]
   \[
   x = 7
   \]

4. **Verify the solution:**
   Add \( x = 7 \) to both the numerator and denominator of \(\frac{3}{5}\):
   \[
   \frac{3 + 7}{5 + 7} = \frac{10}{12}
   \]
   Simplify \(\frac{10}{12}\):
   \[
   \frac{10}{12} = \frac{5}{6}
   \]
   The solution is correct.

**Answer:** The number that should be added is \( 7 \).
