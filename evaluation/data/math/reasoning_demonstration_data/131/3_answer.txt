Answer: To determine the number of ways four people can line up if the youngest cannot be first, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of arrangements without restrictions:**
   - There are 4 people, so the total number of ways to arrange them is \(4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24\).

2. **Calculate the number of invalid arrangements (youngest is first):**
   - If the youngest is first, there are 3 remaining people to arrange in the other positions, which is \(3! = 6\).

3. **Subtract the invalid arrangements from the total:**
   - \(24 - 6 = 18\).

Alternatively, directly count the valid arrangements:

1. **Choose someone other than the youngest for the first position:**
   - There are 3 choices for the first position.

2. **Arrange the remaining 3 people in the other positions:**
   - This can be done in \(3! = 6\) ways.

3. **Multiply the choices:**
   - \(3 \times 6 = 18\).

Thus, the number of ways the four people can line up with the youngest not being first is **18**.
