Reasoning: So i have this problem here: i need to find the minimum value of the expression 
x
2
+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
+
12
y
z
+
4
z
2
x 
2
 +6xy+18y 
2
 +12yz+4z 
2
 , given that 
x
,
y
,
z
x,y,z are positive real numbers and 
x
y
z
=
2
3
xyz= 
3
2
​	
 .

first off, since it's about minimizing a quadratic expression with a constraint, it feels like an optimization problem, probably involving some inequalities like am-gm or maybe lagrange multipliers. but since it's a bit complicated, i should think carefully about how to approach it.

let me look at the expression: 
x
2
+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
+
12
y
z
+
4
z
2
x 
2
 +6xy+18y 
2
 +12yz+4z 
2
 . it seems a bit messy with multiple variables. maybe i can try to complete the square or find some pattern.

wait, maybe i can group some terms to make it easier. for instance, 
x
2
+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
x 
2
 +6xy+18y 
2
  looks like it could be part of a perfect square, but i'm not sure. let's see:

x
2
+
6
x
y
+
9
y
2
=
(
x
+
3
y
)
2
x 
2
 +6xy+9y 
2
 =(x+3y) 
2
 , but i have 
18
y
2
18y 
2
 , which is twice that, so maybe that's not the way.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the expression as a quadratic in terms of one variable, say 
x
x, and then minimize it for that variable given the others.

let me try that. treat the expression as a quadratic in 
x
x:

x
2
+
6
x
y
+
(
18
y
2
+
12
y
z
+
4
z
2
)
x 
2
 +6xy+(18y 
2
 +12yz+4z 
2
 ).

this is a quadratic in 
x
x, so its minimum with respect to 
x
x occurs at 
x
=
−
b
2
a
=
−
6
y
2
=
−
3
y
x=− 
2a
b
​	
 =− 
2
6y
​	
 =−3y. but since 
x
x is positive, and 
y
y is positive, this would suggest 
x
=
3
y
x=3y as the minimizing value for 
x
x in terms of 
y
y.

wait, actually, the formula for the vertex of a parabola 
a
x
2
+
b
x
+
c
ax 
2
 +bx+c is 
x
=
−
b
2
a
x=− 
2a
b
​	
 , which in this case is 
x
=
−
6
y
2
=
−
3
y
x=− 
2
6y
​	
 =−3y, but since 
x
x and 
y
y are positive, perhaps i need to consider that the minimum occurs at the boundary or adjust my approach.

maybe treating it as a quadratic in 
x
x isn't the best way. let's consider another approach.

another idea: use substitution based on the constraint 
x
y
z
=
2
3
xyz= 
3
2
​	
 . maybe i can express one variable in terms of the others and reduce the number of variables.

for example, solve for 
z
z: 
z
=
2
3
x
y
z= 
3xy
2
​	
 . then substitute this into the expression to be minimized:

x
2
+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
+
12
y
(
2
3
x
y
)
+
4
(
2
3
x
y
)
2
x 
2
 +6xy+18y 
2
 +12y( 
3xy
2
​	
 )+4( 
3xy
2
​	
 ) 
2
 .

simplify this expression:

first term: 
x
2
x 
2
 

second term: 
6
x
y
6xy

third term: 
18
y
2
18y 
2
 

fourth term: 
12
y
×
2
3
x
y
=
12

×
2
3
x
y
=

y

x
y
=

x
12y× 
3xy
2
​	
 =12y× 
3xy
2
​	
 = 
3xy
24y
​	
 = 
x
8
​	
 

fifth term: 
4
×
(
2
3
x
y
)
2
=
4

9
x

y

=

x
2
y
2
4×( 
3xy

​	
 ) 
2
 =4× 
9x 
2
 y 
2
 
4
​	
 = 
9x 
2
 y 
2
 
16
​	
 

so the expression becomes:

x
2
+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
+
8
x
+
16
9
x
2
y
2
x 
2
 +6xy+18y 
2
 + 
x
8
​	
 + 
9x 
2
 y 
2
 
16
​	
 

this still looks complicated with both 
x
x and 
y
y present. maybe i should try to express everything in terms of one variable.

alternatively, perhaps using am-gm inequality could help since we're dealing with positive real numbers and products.

let me recall the am-gm inequality: for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean.

but in this case, the expression is a sum of terms with different powers and products of variables, so it might not be straightforward to apply am-gm directly.

another thought: maybe i can use substitution to reduce the number of variables further.

wait, perhaps i can assume a relationship between 
x
x and 
y
y to simplify the expression. for example, set 
x
=
k
y
x=ky for some positive constant 
k
k, and see if that helps.

let me try that. let 
x
=
k
y
x=ky, then 
z
=
2
3
x
y
=
2
3
k
y
2
z= 
3xy
2
​	
 = 
3ky 
2
 
2
​	
 .

now substitute 
x
=
k
y
x=ky and 
z
=
2
3
k
y
2
z= 
3ky 
2
 
2
​	
  into the expression:

x
2
+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
+
12
y
z
+
4
z

=

2

 +12y( 
3ky 
2
 
2
​	
 )+4( 
3ky 
2
 
2
​	
 ) 
2
 

simplify each term:

first term:

second term: 
6
k
y
2

fourth term:

fifth term:

 y

4
​	
 =

so the expression becomes:

k

k

y

k

8
​	
 + 
9k 
2
 y 
4
 
16
​	
 

this still has 
y
y in it, which complicates things. maybe i need to find a relationship that eliminates 
y
y.

alternatively, perhaps i can choose to express 
y
y in terms of 
k
k, but it's getting messy.

let me consider another approach.

maybe i can think of the expression as a quadratic form and try to diagonalize it or find its minimum using matrix methods, but that seems a bit advanced for this context.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the method of lagrange multipliers to find the minimum of the function subject to the constraint.

let me recall how lagrange multipliers work. for a function 
f
(
x
,
y
,
z
)
f(x,y,z) subject to a constraint 
g
(
x
,
y
,
z
)
=
0
g(x,y,z)=0, the extrema occur where the gradient of 
f
f is proportional to the gradient of 
g
g, i.e., 
∇
f
=
λ
∇
g
∇f=λ∇g, where 
λ
λ is the lagrange multiplier.

in this case, 
f
(
x
,
y
,
z
)
=
x
2
+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
+
12
y
z
+
4
z
2
f(x,y,z)=x 
2
 +6xy+18y 
2
 +12yz+4z 
2
 , and the constraint is 
g
(
x
,
y
,
z
)
=
x
y
z
−
2
3
=
0
g(x,y,z)=xyz− 
3
2
​	
 =0.

so, compute the gradients:

∇
f
=
(
2
x
+
6
y
,
6
x
+
36
y
+
12
z
,
12
y
+
8
z
)
∇f=(2x+6y,6x+36y+12z,12y+8z)

∇
g
=
(
y
z
,
x
z
,
x
y
)
∇g=(yz,xz,xy)

set 
∇
f
=
λ
∇
g
∇f=λ∇g:

1. 
2
x
+
6
y
=
λ
y
z
2x+6y=λyz

2. 
6
x
+
36
y
+
12
z
=
λ
x
z
6x+36y+12z=λxz

3. 
12
y
+
8
z
=
λ
x
y
12y+8z=λxy

and the constraint:

4. 
x
y
z
=
2
3
xyz= 
3
2
​	
 

now, this seems quite complicated with four equations and four variables 
x
,
y
,
z
,
λ
x,y,z,λ. maybe there's a better way.

alternatively, perhaps i can look for symmetry or some pattern in the expression to be minimized.

let me look back at the expression: 
x
2
+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
+
12
y
z
+
4
z
2
x 
2
 +6xy+18y 
2
 +12yz+4z 
2
 .

notice that the coefficients are 1, 6, 18, 12, 4. maybe there's a common factor or a ratio that can help.

alternatively, perhaps i can group terms differently:

x
2
+
6
x
y
+
9
y
2
+
9
y
2
+
12
y
z
+
4
z
2
x 
2
 +6xy+9y 
2
 +9y 
2
 +12yz+4z 
2
 

wait, 
x
2
+
6
x
y
+
9
y
2
=
(
x
+
3
y
)
2
x 
2
 +6xy+9y 
2
 =(x+3y) 
2
 , and 
9
y
2
+
12
y
z
+
4
z
2
=
(
3
y
+
2
z
)
2
9y 
2
 +12yz+4z 
2
 =(3y+2z) 
2
 .

so the expression becomes 
(
x
+
3
y
)
2
+
(
3
y
+
2
z
)
2
(x+3y) 
2
 +(3y+2z) 
2
 .

that's interesting! so now the problem is to minimize 
(
x
+
3
y
)
2
+
(
3
y
+
2
z
)
2
(x+3y) 
2
 +(3y+2z) 
2
  given that 
x
y
z
=
2
3
xyz= 
3
2
​	
 .

this seems simpler. maybe i can apply the cauchy-schwarz inequality here.

recall that for vectors 
a
a and 
b
b, 
(
a
⋅
b
)
2
≤
(
a
⋅
a
)
(
b
⋅
b
)
(a⋅b) 
2
 ≤(a⋅a)(b⋅b), but i'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider both squares and find a way to minimize their sum.

wait, maybe i can use am-gm on the two squares.

but am-gm states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean.

so, 
(
x
+
3
y
)
2
+
(
3
y
+
2
z
)
2
2
≥
(
x
+
3
y
)
2
(
3
y
+
2
z
)
2
=
∣
(
x
+
3
y
)
(
3
y
+
2
z
)
∣
2
(x+3y) 
2
 +(3y+2z) 
2
 
​	
 ≥ 
(x+3y) 
2
 (3y+2z) 
2
 
​	
 =∣(x+3y)(3y+2z)∣

but since 
x
,
y
,
z
x,y,z are positive, i can drop the absolute value:

(
x
+
3
y
)
2
+
(
3
y
+
2
z
)
2
2
≥
(
x
+
3
y
)
(
3
y
+
2
z
)
2
(x+3y) 
2
 +(3y+2z) 
2
 
​	
 ≥(x+3y)(3y+2z)

not sure if that helps directly.

alternatively, maybe i can consider the expression 
(
x
+
3
y
)
(x+3y) and 
(
3
y
+
2
z
)
(3y+2z) and find a relationship between them.

wait, perhaps i can set 
a
=
x
+
3
y
a=x+3y and 
b
=
3
y
+
2
z
b=3y+2z, so the expression to minimize is 
a
2
+
b
2
a 
2
 +b 
2
 , and i need to relate 
a
a and 
b
b to the constraint 
x
y
z
=
2
3
xyz= 
3
2
​	
 .

but it's not clear how to proceed from here.

let me consider another angle. maybe i can try to express the original expression in terms of a single variable by using the constraint.

earlier, i tried setting 
x
=
k
y
x=ky, but that led to a complicated expression. maybe instead, i can express 
z
z in terms of 
x
x and 
y
y using 
z
=
2
3
x
y
z= 
3xy
2
​	
 , and substitute back into the expression.

wait, i already tried that earlier and got 
x
2
+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
+
8
x
+
16
9
x
2
y
2
x 
2
 +6xy+18y 
2
 + 
x
8
​	
 + 
9x 
2
 y 
2
 
16
​	
 , which still has two variables.

perhaps i can look for a substitution that reduces it to one variable. for example, express 
y
y in terms of 
x
x, or vice versa.

alternatively, maybe i can assume that the minimum occurs when certain ratios are equal, based on the symmetry of the problem.

wait a minute, let's look back at the expression 
(
x
+
3
y
)
2
+
(
3
y
+
2
z
)
2
(x+3y) 
2
 +(3y+2z) 
2
 . if i consider these two terms, perhaps the minimum occurs when they are equal, i.e., 
x
+
3
y
=
3
y
+
2
z
x+3y=3y+2z, which would imply 
x
=
2
z
x=2z.

let me see if that's a valid assumption. if 
x
=
2
z
x=2z, then from the constraint 
x
y
z
=
2
3
xyz= 
3
2
​	
 , i have 
(
2
z
)
y
z
=
2
3
(2z)yz= 
3
2
​	
 , which simplifies to 
2
y
z
2
=
2
3
2yz 
2
 = 
3
2
​	
 , or 
y
z
2
=
1
3
yz 
2
 = 
3
1
​	
 .

now, substitute 
x
=
2
z
x=2z into the expression:

(
2
z
+
3
y
)
2
+
(
3
y
+
2
z
)
2
(2z+3y) 
2
 +(3y+2z) 
2
 

wait, but if 
x
=
2
z
x=2z, then 
2
z
+
3
y
=
x
+
3
y
2z+3y=x+3y, and 
3
y
+
2
z
=
3
y
+
x
/
2
3y+2z=3y+x/2, but i'm not sure if that's helpful.

alternatively, perhaps i can set 
a
=
x
+
3
y
a=x+3y and 
b
=
3
y
+
2
z
b=3y+2z, and then express the constraint in terms of 
a
a and 
b
b.

from 
a
=
x
+
3
y
a=x+3y and 
b
=
3
y
+
2
z
b=3y+2z, i can try to solve for 
x
,
y
,
z
x,y,z in terms of 
a
a and 
b
b, but that seems complicated.

let me try a different approach. maybe i can consider the expression as a sum of squares and find its minimum.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the method of completing the square for the entire expression.

let me attempt that.

consider the expression 
x
2
+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
+
12
y
z
+
4
z
2
x 
2
 +6xy+18y 
2
 +12yz+4z 
2
 .

i can group the terms involving 
x
x and 
y
y: 
x
2
+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
x 
2
 +6xy+18y 
2
 , and the terms involving 
y
y and 
z
z: 
12
y
z
+
4
z
2
12yz+4z 
2
 .

first, complete the square for 
x
2
+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
x 
2
 +6xy+18y 
2
 :

x
2
+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
=
(
x
+
3
y
)
2
+
9
y
2
x 
2
 +6xy+18y 
2
 =(x+3y) 
2
 +9y 
2
 , since 
(
x
+
3
y
)
2
=
x
2
+
6
x
y
+
9
y
2
(x+3y) 
2
 =x 
2
 +6xy+9y 
2
 , so 
x
2
+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
=
(
x
+
3
y
)
2
+
9
y
2
x 
2
 +6xy+18y 
2
 =(x+3y) 
2
 +9y 
2
 .

similarly, for 
12
y
z
+
4
z
2
12yz+4z 
2
 , complete the square:

12
y
z
+
4
z
2
=
4
(
z
2
+
3
y
z
)
=
4
(
z
2
+
3
y
z
+
9
4
y
2
−

4
y
2
)
=
4
(
(
z
+
3
2
y
)
2
−
9
4
y
2
)
=
4
(
z
+
3
2
y
)
2
−
9
y
2
12yz+4z 
2
 =4(z 
2
 +3yz)=4(z 
2
 +3yz+ 
4
9
​	
 y

 −

9
​	
 y

 )=4((z+

​	
 y)

 − 
4
9
​	
 y 
2
 )=4(z+ 
2
3
​	
 y) 
2
 −9y 
2
 .

so, combining both parts:

x
2
+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
+
12
y
z
+
4
z
2
=
(
x

)
2
+
9
y
2
+
4
(
z
+
3
2
y
)
2
−
9
y
2
=
(
x
+
3
y
)
2
+
4
(
z
+
3
2
y
)
2
x 
2
 +6xy+18y 
2
 +12yz+4z 
2
 =(x+3y) 
2
 +9y 
2
 +4(z+ 
2
3
​	
 y) 
2
 −9y 
2
 =(x+3y) 
2
 +4(z+ 
2
3
​	
 y) 
2
 .

that's nice! so the expression simplifies to 
(
x
+
3
y
)
2
+
4
(
z
+
3
2
y
)
2
(x+3y) 
2
 +4(z+ 
2
3
​	
 y) 
2
 .

now, i need to minimize this expression given that 
x
y
z
=
2
3
xyz= 
3
2
​	
 .

since squares are always non-negative, the minimum occurs when each square is as small as possible. but i have to consider the constraint 
x
y
z
=
2
3
xyz= 
3
2
​	
 , which ties the variables together.

let me set 
a
=
x
+
3
y
a=x+3y and 
b
=
z
+
3
2
y
b=z+ 
2
3
​	
 y, so the expression is 
a
2
+
4
b
2
a 
2
 +4b 
2
 , and i need to minimize this subject to the constraint involving 
x
,
y
,
z
x,y,z.

but i need to express the constraint in terms of 
a
a and 
b
b, which seems tricky.

alternatively, maybe i can use the cauchy-schwarz inequality on the expression 
a
2
+
4
b
2
a 
2
 +4b 
2
 .

recall that for vectors 
(
a
,
2
b
)
(a,2b) and 
(
1
,
1
)
(1,1), the cauchy-schwarz inequality would give 
(
a
⋅
1
+
2
b
⋅
1
)
2
≤
(
a
2
+
(
2
b
)
2
)
(
1
2
+
1
2
)
=
(
a
2
+
4
b
2
)
(
2
)
(a⋅1+2b⋅1) 
2
 ≤(a 
2
 +(2b) 
2
 )(1 
2
 +1 
2
 )=(a 
2
 +4b 
2
 )(2), but i'm not sure if that helps directly.

wait, perhaps i can consider the expression 
a
2
+
4
b
2
a 
2
 +4b 
2
  and try to find its minimum using am-gm.

by am-gm, 
a
2
+
4
b
2
≥
2
4
a
2
b
2
=
4
a
b
a 
2
 +4b 
2
 ≥2 
4a 
2
 b 
2
 
​	
 =4ab, but again, i need to relate this back to the constraint.

this doesn't seem directly helpful.

let me consider another strategy. maybe i can fix one variable and optimize with respect to the others.

for instance, fix 
y
y, and express 
x
x and 
z
z in terms of 
y
y using the constraint.

from 
x
y
z
=
2
3
xyz= 
3
2
​	
 , if i fix 
y
y, then 
x
=
2
3
y
z
x= 
3yz
2
​	
 . but that still leaves two variables.

alternatively, perhaps i can set 
y
y in terms of 
x
x and 
z
z, but that also seems complicated.

wait, perhaps i can consider the expression 
x
2
+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
+
12
y
z
+
4
z
2
x 
2
 +6xy+18y 
2
 +12yz+4z 
2
  as a quadratic in 
y
y, and then find its minimum with respect to 
y
y for given 
x
x and 
z
z.

let me try that.

consider the expression as a quadratic in 
y
y:

18
y
2
+
(
6
x
+
12
z
)
y
+
x
2
+
4
z
2
18y 
2
 +(6x+12z)y+x 
2
 +4z 
2
 .

the minimum with respect to 
y
y occurs at 
y
=
−
b
2
a
=
−
6
x
+
12
z
2
×
18
=
−
6
x
+
12
z
36
=
−
x
+
2
z
6
y=− 
2a
b
​	
 =− 
2×18
6x+12z
​	
 =− 
36
6x+12z
​	
 =− 
6
x+2z
​	
 .

but since 
y
y is positive, this suggests that the minimum occurs at the boundary or that this approach isn't suitable.

maybe instead of treating it as a quadratic in 
y
y, i should try something else.

let me consider using substitution based on the constraint to reduce the number of variables.

from 
x
y
z
=
2
3
xyz= 
3
2
​	
 , i can express 
z
=
2
3
x
y
z= 
3xy
2
​	
 , as i did earlier.

substitute this into the expression to be minimized:

x
2
+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
+
12
y
(
2
3
x
y
)
+
4
(
2
3
x
y
)
2
x 
2
 +6xy+18y 
2
 +12y( 
3xy
2
​	
 )+4( 
3xy
2
​	
 ) 
2
 

simplify:

x
2
+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
+
24
3
x
+
16
9
x

2
 + 
3x
24
​	
 + 
9x 
2
 y 
2
 
16
​	
 

which simplifies to:

x
2
+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
+
8
x
+
16
9
x

 +6xy+18y 
2
 + 
x
8
​	
 + 
9x 
2
 y 
2
 
16
​	
 

this still has both 
x
x and 
y
y, which is not ideal.

perhaps i can set 
t
=
x
y
t=xy, and express everything in terms of 
t
t.

let me try that.

let 
t
=
x
y
t=xy, then 
z
=
2
3
t
z= 
3t
2
​	
 .

now, substitute back into the expression:

x

+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
+
12
y
(
2
3
t

 +6xy+18y 
2
 +12y( 
3t
2
​	
 )+4( 
3t
2
​	
 ) 
2
 

simplify:

x

y

t

2
 +6t+18y 
2
 + 
3t
24y
​	
 + 
9t

​	
 

which is:

x
2

y
2

y
t
+
16
9
t

2
 +6t+18y 
2
 + 
t

​	
 + 
9t 
2
 
16
​	
 

but 
t
=
x
y
t=xy, so 
y
=
t
x
y= 
x
t
​	
 . substitute that in:

x
2
+
6
t

18
(
t

2

(
t

2
 + 
t
8(

 )
​	
 +

​	
 

simplify each term:

first term:

second term:

third term:

fifth term:

so the expression is:

​	
 

this still has 
x
x and 
t
t, which isn't helpful.

maybe i should consider taking partial derivatives with respect to 
x
,
y
,
z
x,y,z and set them to zero to find critical points, but that might be too involved.

wait, perhaps i can make an intelligent guess for the values of 
x
,
y
,
z
x,y,z that minimize the expression.

suppose that the minimum occurs when 
x
=
2
z
x=2z, as i thought earlier, based on the symmetry of the expression.

if 
x
=
2
z
x=2z, then from the constraint 
x
y
z
=
2
3
xyz= 
3
2
​	
 , we have 
(
2
z
)
y
z
=
2
3
(2z)yz= 
3
2
​	
 , which simplifies to 
2
y
z
2
=
2
3
2yz 
2
 = 
3
2
​	
 , so 
y
z
2
=
1
3
yz 
2
 = 
3
1
​	
 .

let me set 
z
=
k
y
z=ky, for some positive constant 
k
k, then 
y
(
k
y
)
2
=
1
3
y(ky) 
2
 = 
3
1
​	
 , which gives 
y
(
k
2
y
2
)
=
1
3
y(k 
2
 y 
2
 )= 
3
1
​	
 , or 
k
2
y
3
=
1
3
k 
2
 y 
3
 = 
3
1
​	
 , so 
y
=
(
1
3
k
2
)
1
/
3
y=( 
3k 
2
 
1
​	
 ) 
1/3
 .

similarly, 
z
=
k
y
=
k
(

)
1
/
3
z=ky=k(

 , and 
x

)
1
/
3
x=2z=2k(

 .

now, substitute these into the expression to be minimized:

12
y
z
+

substitute

z=k(

 :

this seems too messy. maybe there's a better way.

let me consider using the am-gm inequality directly on the original expression.

the expression is 
x
2
+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
+
12
y
z
+
4
z
2
x 
2
 +6xy+18y 
2
 +12yz+4z 
2
 . maybe i can group terms to apply am-gm.

alternatively, perhaps i can look for terms that multiply to a constant, given the constraint 
x
y
z
=
2
3
xyz= 
3
2
​	
 .

wait, here's an idea. let's consider the terms in the expression and see if their product relates to the constraint.

but i'm not sure.

let me try to think differently. maybe i can consider scaling the variables.

suppose i set 
x
=
a
t
x=at, 
y
=
b
t
y=bt, 
z
=
c
t
z=ct, for some positive constants 
a
,
b
,
c
a,b,c, and find the value of 
t
t that minimizes the expression.

from the constraint 
x
y
z
=
2
3
xyz= 
3
2
​	
 , we have 
(
a
t
)
(
b
t
)
(
c
t
)
=
a
b
c
t
3
=
2
3
(at)(bt)(ct)=abct 
3
 = 
3
2
​	
 , so 
t
=
(
2
3
a
b
c
)
1
/
3
t=( 
3abc
2
​	
 ) 
1/3
 .

now, substitute into the expression:

(
a
t
)
2
+
6
(
a
t
)
(
b
t
)
+
18
(
b

)
2
+
12
(
b

)
(

(at)

 =a

 t 
2
 +6abt 
2
 +18b 
2
 t 
2
 +12bct 
2
 +4c 
2
 t

factor out 
t
2
t 
2
 :

t

(

+
4
c
2
)
t 
2
 (a 
2
 +6ab+18b 
2
 +12bc+4c 
2
 )

now, substitute 
t
=
(
2
3
a
b
c
)
1
/
3
t=( 
3abc
2
​	
 )

 :

​	
 ) 
2/3
 (a 
2
 +6ab+18b 
2
 +12bc+4c 
2
 )

to minimize this expression, i need to choose 
a
,
b
,
c
a,b,c such that the expression is minimized.

this seems too vague. maybe i need to make a different substitution.

let me try setting 
u
=
x
+
3
y
u=x+3y and 
v
=
3
y
+
2
z
v=3y+2z, as i did earlier.

then the expression is 
u
2
+
v
2
u 
2
 +v 
2
 , and i need to relate 
u
u and 
v
v to the constraint 
x
y
z
=
2
3
xyz= 
3
2
​	
 .

from 
u
=
x
+
3
y
u=x+3y and 
v
=
3
y
+
2
z
v=3y+2z, i can try to solve for 
x
,
y
,
z
x,y,z in terms of 
u
u and 
v
v.

let me set up the equations:

1. 
u
=
x
+
3
y
u=x+3y

2. 
v
=
3
y
+
2
z
v=3y+2z

i need a third equation to solve for 
x
,
y
,
z
x,y,z in terms of 
u
u and 
v
v, but i only have the constraint 
x
y
z
=
2
3
xyz= 
3
2
​	
 .

this might not be the best approach.

let me consider going back to the original expression and trying to find a lower bound using am-gm.

the expression is 
x
2
+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
+
12
y
z
+
4
z
2
x 
2
 +6xy+18y 
2
 +12yz+4z 
2
 .

i can think of this as a sum of terms, and try to apply am-gm to these terms.

however, since the variables are multiplied together in the constraint, it's not straightforward.

wait, perhaps i can use weighted am-gm inequality.

recall that for positive real numbers and positive weights summing to 1, the weighted am-gm states that 
∑
w
i
a
i
≥
∏
a
i
w
i
∑w 
i
​	
 a 
i
​	
 ≥∏a 
i
w 
i
​	
 
​	
 .

maybe i can assign weights to the terms in the expression to apply this inequality.

but i'm not sure how to choose the weights in this case.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the expression as a sum of squares and use the fact that squares are always non-negative to find a lower bound.

wait, earlier i expressed the expression as 
(
x
+
3
y
)
2
+
4
(
z
+
3
2
y
)
2
(x+3y) 
2
 +4(z+ 
2
3
​	
 y) 
2
 , which is already a sum of squares. since squares are non-negative, the minimum occurs when each square is minimized.

but i still have to consider the constraint 
x
y
z
=
2
3
xyz= 
3
2
​	
 , which ties the variables together.

maybe i can use the method of lagrange multipliers after all, despite the complexity.

let me set up the lagrangian:

l
(
x
,
y
,
z
,
λ
)
=
x
2
+
6
x
y
+
18
y
2
+
12
y
z
+
4
z
2
−
λ
(
x
y
z
−
2
3
)
l(x,y,z,λ)=x 
2
 +6xy+18y 
2
 +12yz+4z 
2
 −λ(xyz− 
3
2
​	
 )

then, take partial derivatives and set them to zero:

1. 
∂
l
∂
x
=
2
x
+
6
y
−
λ
y
z
=
0
∂x
∂l
​	
 =2x+6y−λyz=0

2. 
∂
l
∂
y
=
6
x
+
36
y
+
12
z
−
λ
x
z
=
0
∂y
∂l
​	
 =6x+36y+12z−λxz=0

3. 
∂
l
∂
z
=
12
y
+
8
z
−
λ
x
y
=
0
∂z
∂l
​	
 =12y+8z−λxy=0

4. 
∂
l
∂
λ
=
x
y
z
−
2
3
=
0
∂λ
∂l
​	
 =xyz− 
3
2
​	
 =0

now, i have a system of four equations:

1. 
2
x
+
6
y
=
λ
y
z
2x+6y=λyz

2. 
6
x
+
36
y
+
12
z
=
λ
x
z
6x+36y+12z=λxz

3. 
12
y
+
8
z
=
λ
x
y
12y+8z=λxy

4. 
x
y
z
=
2
3
xyz= 
3
2
​	
 

this system looks complicated to solve directly. maybe i can find ratios between the variables.

from equation 1: 
2
x
+
6
y
=
λ
y
z
2x+6y=λyz

from equation 3: 
12
y
+
8
z
=
λ
x
y
12y+8z=λxy

let me try to eliminate 
λ
λ between these two equations.

from equation 1: 
λ
=
2
x
+
6
y
y
z
λ= 
yz
2x+6y
​	
 

from equation 3: 
λ
=
12
y
+
8
z
x
y
λ= 
xy
12y+8z
​	
 

set them equal:

2
x
+
6
y
y
z
=
12
y
+
8
z
x
y
yz
2x+6y
​	
 = 
xy
12y+8z
​	
 

simplify:

multiply both sides by 
y
z
x
y
yzxy to eliminate denominators:

(
2
x
+
6
y
)
x
y
=
(
12
y
+
8
z
)
y
z
(2x+6y)xy=(12y+8z)yz

simplify:

2
x
2
y
+
6
x
y
2
=
12
y
2
z
+
8
y
z
2
2x 
2
 y+6xy 
2
 =12y 
2
 z+8yz 
2
 

divide both sides by 
2
y
2y:

x
2
+
3
x
y
=
6
y
z
+
4
z
2
x 
2
 +3xy=6yz+4z 
2
 

this relates 
x
,
y
,
z
x,y,z, but it's still not straightforward.

let me look at equation 2:

6
x
+
36
y
+
12
z
=
λ
x
z
6x+36y+12z=λxz

from equation 1, 
λ
=
2
x
+
6
y
y
z
λ= 
yz
2x+6y
​	
 , so substitute into equation 2:

6
x
+
36
y
+
12
z
=
(
2
x
+
6
y
y
z
)
x
z
6x+36y+12z=( 
yz
2x+6y
​	
 )xz

simplify the right side:

(
2
x
+
6
y
y
z
)
x
z
=
2
x
+
6
y
y
z
×
x
z
=
(
2
x
+
6
y
)
x
z
y
z
=
2
x
2
z
+
6
x
y
z
y
z
=
2
x
2
z
y
z
+
6
x
y
z
y
z
=
2
x
2
y
+
6
x
( 
yz
2x+6y
​	
 )xz= 
yz
2x+6y
​	
 ×xz= 
yz
(2x+6y)xz
​	
 = 
yz
2x 
2
 z+6xyz
​	
 = 
yz
2x 
2
 z
​	
 + 
yz
6xyz
​	
 = 
y
2x 
2
 
​	
 +6x

so equation 2 becomes:

6
x
+
36
y
+
12
z
=
2
x
2
y
+
6
x
6x+36y+12z= 
y
2x 
2
 
​	
 +6x

subtract 
6
x
6x from both sides:

36
y
+
12
z
=
2
x
2
y
36y+12z= 
y
2x 
2
 
​	
 

multiply both sides by 
y
y:

36
y
2
+
12
y
z
=
2
x
2
36y 
2
 +12yz=2x 
2
 

simplify:

18
y
2
+
6
y
z
=
x
2
18y 
2
 +6yz=x 
2
 

so now i have 
x
2
=
18
y
2
+
6
y
z
x 
2
 =18y 
2
 +6yz

let me keep this in mind.

earlier, i had 
x
2
+
3
x
y
=
6
y
z
+
4
z
2
x 
2
 +3xy=6yz+4z 
2
 

substitute 
x
2
=
18
y
2
+
6
y
z
x 
2
 =18y 
2
 +6yz into this:

18
y
2
+
6
y
z
+
3
x
y
=
6
y
z
+
4
z
2
18y 
2
 +6yz+3xy=6yz+4z 
2
 

simplify:

18
y
2
+
3
x
y
=
4
z
2
18y 
2
 +3xy=4z 
2
 

now, solve for 
x
x:

3
x
y
=
4
z
2
−
18
y
2
3xy=4z 
2
 −18y 
2
 

x
=
4
z
2
−
18
y
2
3
y
=
4
z
2
3
y
−
6
y
x= 
3y
4z 
2
 −18y 
2
 
​	
 = 
3y
4z 
2
 
​	
 −6y

this is getting complicated. maybe there's a better way.

let me consider that perhaps the minimum occurs when certain ratios are equal, or when some variables are proportional to each other.

wait, earlier i set 
x
=
2
z
x=2z, maybe that's a clue. let me try assuming 
x
=
2
z
x=2z and see where that leads.

if 
x
=
2
z
x=2z, then from the constraint 
x
y
z
=
2
3
xyz= 
3
2
​	
 , we have 
2
z
⋅
y
⋅
z
=
2
3
2z⋅y⋅z= 
3
2
​	
 , so 
2
y
z
2
=
2
3
2yz 
2
 =

2
​	
 , which simplifies to 
y
z
2
=

3
yz 
2
 =

​	
 .

let me express

z

y

y=

now, substitute

y

z

  with respect to

this seems more manageable. let me set

2
z

f(z)=8z 
2
 + 
z

​	
 +

​	
 , and find its minimum.

to find the minimum, take the derivative of 
f
(
z
)
f(z) with respect to 
z
z and set it to zero.

first, find 
f

(

)
f

​	
 

set 
f

=

f

 (z)=0:

16
z

z

=

16z− 
z

​	
 − 
z

​	
 =0

multiply both sides by 
z

z

  to eliminate denominators:

−

=

16z⋅z

simplify:

z
6
−
8
z
3
−
8
=

16z 
6
 −8z 
3
 −8=0

divide the entire equation by 8:

2
z
6
−
z
3
−
1
=
0
2z 
6
 −z 
3
 −1=0

let me set 
w
=
z
3
w=z 
3
 , then the equation becomes:

2
w
2
−
w
−
1
=
0
2w 
2
 −w−1=0

now, solve for 
w
w:

w
=

±

+

=

±
3
4
w= 
4
1± 
1+8
​	
 
​	
 =

​	
 

so, 
w
=
1
w=1 or 
w
=
−
1
2
w=− 
2
1
​	
 

since 
w
=
z
3
w=z 
3
  and 
z
>
0
z>0, we discard the negative solution, so 
w
=
1
w=1, hence 
z
3
=
1
z 
3
 =1, which means 
z
=
1
z=1.

now, find the minimum value by substituting 
z
=
1
z=1 back into 
f
(
z
)
f(z):

f
(
1
)
=
8
(

)
2
+
8
1
+

=

=

f(1)=8(1) 
2
 + 
1
8
​	
 + 
1 
4
 
2
​	
 =8+8+2=18

therefore, the minimum value of the original expression is 
18
18.

to confirm that this is indeed the minimum, i can check the second derivative or consider the behavior of the function, but given the context, it's reasonable to conclude that 
18
18 is the minimum value.

**final answer**

18
