Answer: Given the problem, we need to find the smallest number of steps \( n \) greater than 10 that satisfies the following conditions:

1. when ray climbs 4 steps at a time, there are 3 steps left at the top, i.e., \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).
2. when ray climbs 5 steps at a time, there are 2 steps left at the top, i.e., \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).

we start by expressing \( n \) in terms of one of the congruences and substituting into the other:

1. \( n = 4k + 3 \) for some integer \( k \).
2. substitute into the second congruence: \( 4k + 3 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).

simplifying the second congruence:
\[
4k + 3 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \implies 4k \equiv -1 \pmod{5} \implies 4k \equiv 4 \pmod{5}
\]
since \( 4 \) and \( 5 \) are coprime, we can divide both sides by 4:
\[
k \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \implies k = 5m + 1 \text{ for some integer } m
\]

substitute back into \( n = 4k + 3 \):
\[
n = 4(5m + 1) + 3 = 20m + 4 + 3 = 20m + 7
\]

we need the smallest \( n > 10 \):
\[
20m + 7 > 10 \implies 20m > 3 \implies m > \frac{3}{20}
\]
the smallest integer \( m \) is 1:
\[
n = 20(1) + 7 = 27
\]

thus, the smallest possible value of \( n \) that is greater than 10 is:
\[
\boxed{27}
\]
