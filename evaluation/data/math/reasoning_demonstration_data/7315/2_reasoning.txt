Reasoning: 
So i have this problem here. ray is climbing stairs in different ways, and i need to find the smallest number of steps, n, that's greater than 10, based on how he climbs. let's see what the problem says.

first, when ray climbs 4 steps at a time, there are 3 steps left at the top. that means that when he takes jumps of 4 steps, he doesn't land exactly on the top step; instead, he lands on the step that's 3 steps below the top. so, if n is the total number of steps, then n divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 3. in other words, n ≡ 3 mod 4.

similarly, when he climbs 5 steps at a time, there are 2 steps left at the top. so, n divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 2. that means n ≡ 2 mod 5.

i need to find the smallest n > 10 that satisfies both of these conditions.

alright, so i have two congruences:

1. n ≡ 3 mod 4

2. n ≡ 2 mod 5

i need to find a number n that satisfies both of these.

one way to approach this is to list out numbers that satisfy each condition and find the smallest one that appears in both lists and is greater than 10.

let's first list numbers that are ≡ 3 mod 4. that means numbers that are 3 more than a multiple of 4.

so, starting from 0:

0 + 3 = 3

4 + 3 = 7

8 + 3 = 11

12 + 3 = 15

16 + 3 = 19

20 + 3 = 23

24 + 3 = 27

and so on.

so, the sequence is: 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, ...

now, numbers that are ≡ 2 mod 5. that means numbers that are 2 more than a multiple of 5.

starting from 0:

0 + 2 = 2

5 + 2 = 7

10 + 2 = 12

15 + 2 = 17

20 + 2 = 22

25 + 2 = 27

and so on.

so, the sequence is: 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, ...

now, i need to find the smallest number greater than 10 that appears in both sequences.

looking at the first sequence: 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, ...

second sequence: 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, ...

looking for numbers greater than 10:

from the first sequence: 11, 15, 19, 23, 27,...

from the second sequence: 12, 17, 22, 27,...

looking for common numbers: 27 is common.

but is there any smaller number than 27 that is in both sequences and greater than 10?

let's see:

11 is in the first sequence, but is 11 in the second sequence? looking at the second sequence: 12, 17, 22, 27,... no, 11 is not there.

15 is in the first sequence; is 15 in the second sequence? the second sequence has 12, 17, 22, 27,... no, 15 is not there.

19 is in the first sequence; is 19 in the second sequence? second sequence: 12, 17, 22, 27,... no, not there.

23 is in the first sequence; is 23 in the second sequence? second sequence: 12, 17, 22, 27,... no.

then 27 is in both sequences.

is there any number smaller than 27 that satisfies both conditions and is greater than 10? it seems not.

but maybe i should check if there's a better way to solve this without listing out numbers, in case n could be larger and listing isn't efficient.

let me try solving the system of congruences.

we have:

n ≡ 3 mod 4

n ≡ 2 mod 5

i can express n as n = 4k + 3 for some integer k.

now, substitute this into the second congruence:

4k + 3 ≡ 2 mod 5

so, 4k + 3 - 2 ≡ 0 mod 5

4k + 1 ≡ 0 mod 5

4k ≡ -1 mod 5

but -1 mod 5 is the same as 4 mod 5, because -1 + 5 = 4.

so, 4k ≡ 4 mod 5

now, i can divide both sides by 4, but i have to be careful because division in modular arithmetic requires that 4 and 5 are coprime, which they are, since gcd(4,5)=1.

so, k ≡ 1 mod 5

therefore, k = 5m + 1 for some integer m.

now, substitute back into n = 4k + 3:

n = 4(5m + 1) + 3 = 20m + 4 + 3 = 20m + 7

so, n = 20m + 7

now, i need to find the smallest n > 10.

so, set 20m + 7 > 10

20m > 3

m > 3/20

since m is an integer, the smallest m is m=0.

then n=20*0 +7=7, but 7 is not greater than 10.

next m=1: n=20*1 +7=27, which is greater than 10.

so, n=27 is the smallest n>10 that satisfies both conditions.

wait, but earlier i saw that 27 is in both sequences, and it seems to be the smallest greater than 10.

but just to confirm, is there any n between 10 and 27 that satisfies both conditions?

looking back at the sequences:

first sequence: 11,15,19,23,27,...

second sequence:12,17,22,27,...

no overlap before 27.

therefore, n=27 is indeed the smallest number greater than 10 that satisfies both conditions.

so, the answer should be 27.

**final answer**

27
