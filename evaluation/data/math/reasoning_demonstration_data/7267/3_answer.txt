Answer: To convert the base-eight number 31 to a base-ten number:

1. **Identify the place values:** In base-eight, the rightmost digit is the \(8^0\) place, and the next digit to the left is the \(8^1\) place.

2. **Multiply each digit by its corresponding place value:**
   - The rightmost digit is 1, which is in the \(8^0\) place: \(1 \times 8^0 = 1 \times 1 = 1\)
   - The next digit is 3, which is in the \(8^1\) place: \(3 \times 8^1 = 3 \times 8 = 24\)

3. **Add the results together:**
   \[
   24 + 1 = 25
   \]

Therefore, the base-ten number represented by the base-eight number 31 is **25**.
