Reasoning: So i've got this equation: 
(
x
−
2
)
(
25
−
x
2
)
=
1
(x−2) 
(25−x 
2
 )
 =1, and i need to find out how many integer solutions there are for 
x
x. okay, let's start by understanding when an expression like 
a
b
=
1
a 
b
 =1 holds true.

first off, there are a few scenarios where this can happen:

1. **when the base is 1**: because 
1
1 raised to any power is always 
1
1. so, if 
x
−
2
=
1
x−2=1, then 
(
x
−
2
)
(
25
−
x
2
)
=
1
(x−2) 
(25−x 
2
 )
 =1.

2. **when the base is -1 and the exponent is even**: because 
−
1
−1 raised to an even power is 
1
1. so, if 
x
−
2
=
−
1
x−2=−1 and the exponent 
25
−
x
2
25−x 
2
  is even, then 
(
x
−
2
)
(
25
−
x
2
)
=
1
(x−2) 
(25−x 
2
 )
 =1.

3. **when the exponent is 0 and the base is not 0**: because any non-zero number raised to the power of 
0
0 is 
1
1. so, if 
25
−
x
2
=
0
25−x 
2
 =0 and 
x
−
2
≠
0
x−2

=0, then 
(
x
−
2
)
(
25
−
x
2
)
=
1
(x−2) 
(25−x 
2
 )
 =1.

i should consider each of these cases separately and find the integer values of 
x
x that satisfy them.

**case 1: base is 1**

so, 
x
−
2
=
1
x−2=1

solving for 
x
x:

x
=
3
x=3

now, i need to check if this value satisfies the original equation.

(
3
−
2
)
(
25
−
9
)
=
1
16
=
1
(3−2) 
(25−9)
 =1 
16
 =1, which is true.

so, 
x
=
3
x=3 is one solution.

**case 2: base is -1 and exponent is even**

first, set 
x
−
2
=
−
1
x−2=−1:

x
−
2
=
−
1
x−2=−1

x
=
1
x=1

now, check if the exponent 
25
−
x
2
25−x 
2
  is even.

25
−
(
1
)
2
=
25
−
1
=
24
25−(1) 
2
 =25−1=24, which is even.

therefore, 
(
−
1
)
24
=
1
(−1) 
24
 =1, which holds true.

so, 
x
=
1
x=1 is another solution.

**case 3: exponent is 0 and base is not 0**

set the exponent to zero:

25
−
x
2
=
0
25−x 
2
 =0

solving for 
x
x:

x
2
=
25
x 
2
 =25

x
=
±
5
x=±5

now, ensure that the base 
x
−
2
x−2 is not zero.

for 
x
=
5
x=5:

5
−
2
=
3
≠
0
5−2=3

=0, so it's valid.

for 
x
=
−
5
x=−5:

−
5
−
2
=
−
7
≠
0
−5−2=−7

=0, so it's also valid.

therefore, both 
x
=
5
x=5 and 
x
=
−
5
x=−5 are solutions.

so far, i have four potential solutions: 
x
=
−
5
,
1
,
3
,
5
x=−5,1,3,5.

but wait, i should check if there are any other possibilities where 
(
x
−
2
)
(
25
−
x
2
)
=
1
(x−2) 
(25−x 
2
 )
 =1.

is there a case when the base is 0 and the exponent is positive? well, 
0
0 raised to any positive power is 
0
0, not 
1
1, so that doesn't help.

what about when the base is something else, but the exponent makes the whole expression equal to 1?

hmm, for example, if the base is 
a
a and the exponent is 
b
b, and 
a
b
=
1
a 
b
 =1, but neither 
a
=
1
a=1, nor 
a
=
−
1
a=−1 with even 
b
b, nor 
b
=
0
b=0 with 
a
≠
0
a

=0, are there other possibilities?

well, if 
a
=
−
1
a=−1 and 
b
b is even, that's already covered in case 2.

if 
a
a is some other number, say 
a
=
2
a=2, then 
2
0
=
1
2 
0
 =1, which is covered in case 3.

wait, no, in case 3, i already considered when the exponent is zero and the base is not zero.

but perhaps there are other cases where 
a
b
=
1
a 
b
 =1 for different 
a
a and 
b
b.

for example, 
a
=
−
1
a=−1 and 
b
b is even, as above.

what about 
a
=
1
a=1 and any 
b
b, which is also covered in case 1.

is there any other scenario?

well, in general, 
a
b
=
1
a 
b
 =1 if:

- 
a
=
1
a=1, any 
b
b

- 
a
=
−
1
a=−1, 
b
b even

- 
b
=
0
b=0, 
a
≠
0
a

=0

are there any exceptions or other possibilities?

let me think about 
a
=
e
2
π
k
i
a=e 
2πki
  for integer 
k
k, but that's more for complex numbers, and here we're dealing with integers, so probably not relevant.

so, i think i've covered all the possible cases for integer 
x
x.

therefore, the integer solutions are 
x
=
−
5
,
1
,
3
,
5
x=−5,1,3,5, which is a total of four solutions.

wait a minute, but maybe i should check if there are any other integer values that could satisfy the equation in a different way.

for example, if the base is 
0
0, but as i said earlier, 
0
0 raised to any positive power is 
0
0, not 
1
1, so that doesn't work.

what if the base is undefined, like 
0
0
0 
0
  or negative bases with fractional exponents?

well, in integer exponents, negative bases are fine as long as the exponent is integer.

but in this problem, since both base and exponent are expressions in 
x
x, and 
x
x is integer, the exponent 
25
−
x
2
25−x 
2
  will always be integer.

moreover, if the base is negative and the exponent is even, it's covered in case 2.

if the base is negative and the exponent is odd, then the result is negative, which is not equal to 
1
1.

therefore, i don't think there are any other integer solutions besides the four i found.

let me list them again: 
x
=
−
5
,
1
,
3
,
5
x=−5,1,3,5.

so, the number of integer solutions is 4.

wait, but just to be thorough, maybe i should plug in these values into the original equation to confirm.

for 
x
=
−
5
x=−5:

(
−
5
−
2
)
25
−
25
=
(
−
7
)
0
=
1
(−5−2) 
25−25
 =(−7) 
0
 =1, which is correct.

for 
x
=
1
x=1:

(
1
−
2
)
25
−
1
=
(
−
1
)
24
=
1
(1−2) 
25−1
 =(−1) 
24
 =1, which is correct.

for 
x
=
3
x=3:

(
3
−
2
)
25
−
9
=
1
16
=
1
(3−2) 
25−9
 =1 
16
 =1, which is correct.

for 
x
=
5
x=5:

(
5
−
2
)
25
−
25
=
3
0
=
1
(5−2) 
25−25
 =3 
0
 =1, which is correct.

okay, all of them work.

is there any integer value of 
x
x that i might have missed?

let me consider if 
x
−
2
x−2 could be something else that, raised to some power, equals 1.

for example, if 
x
−
2
=
e
2
π
k
i
x−2=e 
2πki
 , but since we're dealing with integers, 
x
−
2
x−2 must be an integer.

so, the only integers 
a
a for which 
a
b
=
1
a 
b
 =1 are:

- 
a
=
1
a=1, any integer 
b
b

- 
a
=
−
1
a=−1, even integer 
b
b

- 
a
a any non-zero integer, 
b
=
0
b=0

and these are exactly the cases i considered earlier.

therefore, i don't think there are any other integer solutions.

so, the final answer is 4.

**final answer**

4
4
