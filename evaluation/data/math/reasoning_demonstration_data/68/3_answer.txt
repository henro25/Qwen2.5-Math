Answer: To determine the number of integer solutions to the equation \((x-2)^{(25-x^2)} = 1\), we consider the following cases:

1. **base is 1**:
   \[
   x - 2 = 1 \implies x = 3
   \]
   this satisfies the equation since \((3-2)^{25-9} = 1^{16} = 1\).

2. **base is -1 and exponent is even**:
   \[
   x - 2 = -1 \implies x = 1
   \]
   the exponent \(25 - x^2 = 24\) is even, so \((-1)^{24} = 1\).

3. **exponent is 0 and base is not 0**:
   \[
   25 - x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = 25 \implies x = \pm 5
   \]
   both \(x = 5\) and \(x = -5\) satisfy the equation since \((5-2)^0 = 3^0 = 1\) and \((-5-2)^0 = (-7)^0 = 1\).

thus, the integer solutions are \(x = -5, 1, 3, 5\), giving a total of 4 solutions.

\[
\boxed{4}
\]
