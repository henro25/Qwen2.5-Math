Reasoning: So i've got this equation to solve:

x
+
x
+
x
+
⋯
3
3
3
=
x
x
x
⋯
3
3
3
.
3
  
x+ 
3
  
x+ 
3
  
x+⋯
​
 
​
 
​
 = 
3
  
x 
3
  
x 
3
  
x⋯
​
 
​
 
​
 .
hmm, it looks like both sides have these infinite nested cube roots, but they're structured differently. on the left side, it's like adding x inside each cube root, and on the right side, it's multiplying x inside each cube root. i need to find the positive solution for x.

first, i should probably try to understand what each side represents separately. maybe i can set each side equal to some variable and see if i can solve for that variable in terms of x.

let's start with the left side:

x
+
x
+
x
+
⋯
3
3
3
3
  
x+ 
3
  
x+ 
3
  
x+⋯
​
 
​
 
​
 
let me call this expression y. so,

y
=
x
+
x
+
x
+
⋯
3
3
3
y= 
3
  
x+ 
3
  
x+ 
3
  
x+⋯
​
 
​
 
​
 
but wait, the expression inside the cube root is the same as y itself, right? because it's infinitely repeating. so i can write:

y
=
x
+
y
3
y= 
3
  
x+y
​
 
now, to get rid of the cube root, i'll cube both sides:

y
3
=
x
+
y
y 
3
 =x+y
let's rearrange this:

y
3
−
y
−
x
=
0
y 
3
 −y−x=0
so, for the left side, i have this cubic equation relating y and x.

now, let's look at the right side:

x
x
x
⋯
3
3
3
3
  
x 
3
  
x 
3
  
x⋯
​
 
​
 
​
 
let me call this expression z. so,

z
=
x
x
x
⋯
3
3
3
z= 
3
  
x 
3
  
x 
3
  
x⋯
​
 
​
 
​
 
again, the expression inside the cube root is z itself, because of the infinite nesting. therefore:

z
=
x
z
3
z= 
3
  
xz
​
 
cubing both sides:

z
3
=
x
z
z 
3
 =xz
assuming z ≠ 0, i can divide both sides by z:

z
2
=
x
z 
2
 =x
so, z squared equals x. that's interesting.

now, going back to the left side, i have y^3 - y - x = 0, and from the right side, x = z^2.

since both sides of the original equation are equal, y = z. so, i can set y = z.

therefore, from y^3 - y - x = 0 and x = z^2, and y = z, substituting z for y and z^2 for x, i get:

z
3
−
z
−
z
2
=
0
z 
3
 −z−z 
2
 =0
let me rearrange this equation:

z
3
−
z
2
−
z
=
0
z 
3
 −z 
2
 −z=0
i can factor out a z:

z
(
z
2
−
z
−
1
)
=
0
z(z 
2
 −z−1)=0
so, the solutions are z = 0 or z^2 - z - 1 = 0.

since we're looking for positive solutions, z = 0 doesn't make sense in this context because x = z^2 would also be 0, but plugging x = 0 into the original equation might not be meaningful. so, let's focus on the quadratic equation:

z
2
−
z
−
1
=
0
z 
2
 −z−1=0
using the quadratic formula:

z
=
1
±
1
+
4
2
=
1
±
5
2
z= 
2
1± 
1+4
​
 
​
 = 
2
1± 
5
​
 
​
 
since we're interested in positive solutions, we'll take the positive root:

z
=
1
+
5
2
z= 
2
1+ 
5
​
 
​
 
now, recall that x = z^2. so,

x
=
(
1
+
5
2
)
2
x=( 
2
1+ 
5
​
 
​
 ) 
2
 
let me compute that:

x
=
(
1
+
5
)
2
4
=
1
+
2
5
+
5
4
=
6
+
2
5
4
=
3
+
5
2
x= 
4
(1+ 
5
​
 ) 
2
 
​
 = 
4
1+2 
5
​
 +5
​
 = 
4
6+2 
5
​
 
​
 = 
2
3+ 
5
​
 
​
 
so, the positive solution is x = (3 + √5)/2.

wait a minute, let me check if this makes sense.

first, plug x back into the expressions to see if both sides are indeed equal.

let's compute the left side:

y
=
x
+
y
3
y= 
3
  
x+y
​
 
we have y = z = (1 + √5)/2, and x = (3 + √5)/2.

plugging in:

y
=
3
+
5
2
+
1
+
5
2
3
=
4
+
2
5
2
3
=
2
+
5
3
y= 
3
  
2
3+ 
5
​
 
​
 + 
2
1+ 
5
​
 
​
 
​
 = 
3
  
2
4+2 
5
​
 
​
 
​
 = 
3
  
2+ 
5
​
 
​
 
now, does y equal to (1 + √5)/2?

let's compute ((1 + √5)/2)^3:

(
1
+
5
2
)
3
=
1
+
3
5
+
3
(
5
)
+
(
5
)
3
8
=
1
+
3
5
+
15
+
5
5
8
=
16
+
8
5
8
=
2
+
5
( 
2
1+ 
5
​
 
​
 ) 
3
 = 
8
1+3 
5
​
 +3(5)+( 
5
​
 ) 
3
 
​
 = 
8
1+3 
5
​
 +15+5 
5
​
 
​
 = 
8
16+8 
5
​
 
​
 =2+ 
5
​
 
so, y^3 = 2 + √5, which matches the expression inside the cube root for y. therefore, it checks out.

now, let's look at the right side:

z
=
x
z
3
z= 
3
  
xz
​
 
with z = (1 + √5)/2 and x = (3 + √5)/2:

z
=
3
+
5
2
⋅
1
+
5
2
3
=
(
3
+
5
)
(
1
+
5
)
4
3
z= 
3
  
2
3+ 
5
​
 
​
 ⋅ 
2
1+ 
5
​
 
​
 
​
 = 
3
  
4
(3+ 
5
​
 )(1+ 
5
​
 )
​
 
​
 
let's compute the numerator:

(
3
+
5
)
(
1
+
5
)
=
3
⋅
1
+
3
⋅
5
+
5
⋅

+
5
⋅
5
=

5
+
5
+
5
=
8
+
4
5
(3+ 
5
​
 )(1+ 
5
​
 )=3⋅1+3⋅ 
5
​
 + 
5
​
 ⋅1+ 
5
​
 ⋅ 
5
​
 =3+3 
5
​
 + 
5
​
 +5=8+4 
5
​
 
so,

z
=
8
+
4
5
4
3
=
2
+
5
3
z= 
3
  
4
8+4 
5
​
 
​
 
​
 = 
3
  
2+ 
5
​
 
​
 
again, since z = (1 + √5)/2, and we've already checked that z^3 = 2 + √5, this also checks out.

therefore, the positive solution is indeed x = (3 + √5)/2.

just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other positive solutions. we had z(z^2 - z - 1) = 0, leading to z = 0 or z = [1 ± √5]/2. we dismissed z = 0 because it doesn't make sense in the context, and we took the positive root. the negative root would be z = [1 - √5]/2, which is negative since √5 > 1. so, no other positive solutions exist.

thus, the only positive solution is x = (3 + √5)/2.

**final answer**
