Answer: Given that \( s(n) = 1274 \), we need to determine which of the provided options could be the value of \( s(n+1) \).

when adding 1 to \( n \), if \( n \) ends with \( k \) consecutive 9's, the sum of the digits of \( n+1 \) can be expressed as:
\[ s(n+1) = s(n) - 9k + 1 \]

we need to check which of the given options can be written in the form:
\[ s(n+1) = 1275 - 9k \]
where \( k \) is a non-negative integer.

let's evaluate each option:

1. for option a) 1:
\[ 1275 - 9k = 1 \implies 9k = 1274 \implies k = \frac{1274}{9} \approx 141.555 \]
\( k \) is not an integer, so this is not possible.

2. for option b) 3:
\[ 1275 - 9k = 3 \implies 9k = 1272 \implies k = \frac{1272}{9} \approx 141.333 \]
\( k \) is not an integer, so this is not possible.

3. for option c) 12:
\[ 1275 - 9k = 12 \implies 9k = 1263 \implies k = \frac{1263}{9} \approx 140.333 \]
\( k \) is not an integer, so this is not possible.

4. for option d) 1239:
\[ 1275 - 9k = 1239 \implies 9k = 36 \implies k = \frac{36}{9} = 4 \]
\( k \) is an integer, so this is possible.

5. for option e) 1265:
\[ 1275 - 9k = 1265 \implies 9k = 10 \implies k = \frac{10}{9} \approx 1.111 \]
\( k \) is not an integer, so this is not possible.

therefore, the only possible value for \( s(n+1) \) is:
\[
\boxed{1239}
\]
