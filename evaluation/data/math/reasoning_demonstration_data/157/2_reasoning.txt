Reasoning: 
Alright, so I have this problem here. It says that only one quarter of the Earth's surface is not covered by bodies of water. So, first things first, I need to understand what that means. The Earth is mostly covered by water, like oceans and stuff, and only a part of it is land. According to this, one quarter, which is the same as 1/4, of the Earth's surface is land.

Then, it says that only one half of that exposed land area is inhabitable for humans because of places like the poles, deserts, and so on. So, of that 1/4 land area, only half of it is suitable for humans to live on.

I need to find out what fraction of the Earth's total surface area is inhabitable for humans.

Okay, so let's break this down step by step. The Earth's total surface area is, well, 1, right? Because fractions are parts of the whole, and the whole is 1.

So, if one quarter of the Earth's surface is land, that means the land area is 1/4 of the Earth's surface.

Now, of that land area, only half is inhabitable. So, I need to find half of 1/4.

To find half of something, I can multiply by 1/2.

So, half of 1/4 is 1/2 * 1/4.

Multiplying fractions is straightforward: multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.

So, 1 * 1 is 1, and 2 * 4 is 8. So, 1/8.

Therefore, the fraction of the Earth's surface that humans can live on is 1/8.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.

Total Earth surface: 1.

Land area: 1/4.

Inhabitable land: half of 1/4, which is 1/8.

Yeah, that seems correct.

But maybe I should think about it differently to confirm.

Suppose the Earth's surface is divided into 4 equal parts, and one part is land.

Then, of that one part, only half is inhabitable.

So, half of one part is 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8.

Same result.

Alternatively, if I think of percentages, 25% of the Earth is land, and half of that is inhabitable, so 12.5% is inhabitable.

12.5% is the same as 1/8.

So, again, 1/8.

Seems consistent.

I think I've got it.
