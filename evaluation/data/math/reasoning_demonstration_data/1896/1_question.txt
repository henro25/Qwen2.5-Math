Problem: The diagram below shows a $4\times4$ rectangular array of points, each of which is $1$ unit away from its nearest neighbors.
[asy] unitsize(0.25inch); defaultpen(linewidth(0.7));  int i, j; for(i = 0; i < 4; ++i) 	for(j = 0; j < 4; ++j) 		dot(((real)i, (real)j)); [/asy]
Define a growing path to be a sequence of distinct points of the array with the property that the distance between consecutive points of the sequence is strictly increasing. Let $m$ be the maximum possible number of points in a growing path, and let $r$ be the number of growing paths consisting of exactly $m$ points. Find $mr$.
