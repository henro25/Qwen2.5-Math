Problem: One line is described by
\[\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ -k \end{pmatrix}.\]Another line is described by
\[\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 4 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} k \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.\]If the lines are coplanar (i.e. there is a plane that contains both lines), then find all possible values of $k.$
