Problem: The numbers from 1 to 150, inclusive, are placed in a bag and a number is randomly selected from the bag. What is the probability it is not a perfect power (integers that can be expressed as $x^{y}$ where $x$ is an integer and $y$ is an integer greater than 1. For example, $2^{4}=16$ is a perfect power, while $2\times3=6$ is not a perfect power)? Express your answer as a common fraction.
