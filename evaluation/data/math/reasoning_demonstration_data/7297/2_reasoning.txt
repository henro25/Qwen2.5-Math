Reasoning: 
So i have this problem here, and i need to find all real numbers 
k
k such that the norm of 
k
(
2
−
3
 
)
−
(
4
7
 
)
k( 
2
−3
​	
 )−( 
4
7
​	
 ) equals 
2
13
2 
13
​	
 . okay, let's break this down step by step.

first, i know that the norm of a vector 
(
a
b
 
)
( 
a
b
​	
 ) is given by 
a
2
+
b
2
a 
2
 +b 
2
 
​	
 . so, i need to find the expression inside the norm and then set its norm equal to 
2
13
2 
13
​	
 .

let's compute 
k
(
2
−
3
 
)
−
(
4
7
 
)
k( 
2
−3
​	
 )−( 
4
7
​	
 ):

k
(
2
−
3
 
)
=
(
2
k
−
3
k
 
)
k( 
2
−3
​	
 )=( 
2k
−3k
​	
 )

subtracting 
(
4
7
 
)
( 
4
7
​	
 ) gives:

(
2
k
−
4
−
3
k
−
7
 
)
( 
2k−4
−3k−7
​	
 )

now, the norm of this vector is:

(
2
k
−
4
)
2
+
(
−
3
k
−
7
)
2
=
2
13
(2k−4) 
2
 +(−3k−7) 
2
 
​	
 =2 
13
​	
 

to solve for 
k
k, i'll square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(
2
k
−
4
)
2
+
(
−
3
k
−
7
)
2
=
(
2
13
)
2
(2k−4) 
2
 +(−3k−7) 
2
 =(2 
13
​	
 ) 
2
 

simplifying the right side:

(
2
13
)
2
=
4
×
13
=
52
(2 
13
​	
 ) 
2
 =4×13=52

so now the equation is:

(
2
k
−
4
)
2
+
(
−
3
k
−
7
)
2
=
52
(2k−4) 
2
 +(−3k−7) 
2
 =52

let's expand the squares:

first, 
(
2
k
−
4
)
2
=
4
k
2
−
16
k
+
16
(2k−4) 
2
 =4k 
2
 −16k+16

second, 
(
−
3
k
−
7
)
2
=
9
k
2
+
42
k
+
49
(−3k−7) 
2
 =9k 
2
 +42k+49

adding them together:

4
k
2
−
16
k
+
16
+
9
k
2
+
42
k
+
49
=
52
4k 
2
 −16k+16+9k 
2
 +42k+49=52

combine like terms:

13
k
2
+
26
k
+
65
=
52
13k 
2
 +26k+65=52

subtract 52 from both sides:

13
k
2
+
26
k
+
13
=
0
13k 
2
 +26k+13=0

i notice that all coefficients are divisible by 13, so i'll divide the entire equation by 13:

k
2
+
2
k
+
1
=
0
k 
2
 +2k+1=0

this simplifies to:

(
k
+
1
)
2
=
0
(k+1) 
2
 =0

so, 
k
=
−
1
k=−1 is the solution.

wait a minute, the problem says "all real numbers 
k
k", and this seems to give only one solution. is there only one real solution?

let me check my steps to make sure i didn't make a mistake.

starting from:

(
2
k
−
4
)
2
+
(
−
3
k
−
7
)
2
=
52
(2k−4) 
2
 +(−3k−7) 
2
 =52

expanding:

4
k
2
−
16
k
+
16
+
9
k
2
+
42
k
+
49
=
52
4k 
2
 −16k+16+9k 
2
 +42k+49=52

combining like terms:

13
k
2
+
26
k
+
65
=
52
13k 
2
 +26k+65=52

subtracting 52:

13
k
2
+
26
k
+
13
=
0
13k 
2
 +26k+13=0

dividing by 13:

k
2
+
2
k
+
1
=
0
k 
2
 +2k+1=0

which factors to:

(
k
+
1
)
2
=
0
(k+1) 
2
 =0

so, indeed, 
k
=
−
1
k=−1 is the only solution.

but the problem says "all real numbers 
k
k", and this suggests there might be multiple solutions. maybe i should check if there are any other solutions that i missed.

alternatively, perhaps the equation only has one real solution, and that's it.

let me consider the geometric interpretation. the expression 
k
(
2
−
3
 
)
k( 
2
−3
​	
 ) represents a line through the origin in the direction of 
(
2
−
3
 
)
( 
2
−3
​	
 ), and subtracting 
(
4
7
 
)
( 
4
7
​	
 ) shifts this line.

the norm being equal to 
2
13
2 
13
​	
  means that the distance from the point 
(
4
7
 
)
( 
4
7
​	
 ) to the line is 
2
13
2 
13
​	
 .

wait, actually, more precisely, it's the distance between the point 
(
4
7
 
)
( 
4
7
​	
 ) and the point 
k
(
2
−
3
 
)
k( 
2
−3
​	
 ) equals 
2
13
2 
13
​	
 .

this seems like finding points on the line parameterized by 
k
k that are at a distance 
2
13
2 
13
​	
  from the point 
(
4
7
 
)
( 
4
7
​	
 ).

graphically, this should result in either two points of intersection (two solutions), one point (tangent, one solution), or no points (no real solutions) depending on the distance.

but in this case, the equation led to only one solution. maybe the line is tangent to the circle of radius 
2
13
2 
13
​	
  centered at 
(
4
7
 
)
( 
4
7
​	
 ), meaning only one intersection point.

alternatively, perhaps i made an error in the algebra.

let me double-check the expansion:

(
2
k
−
4
)
2
=
4
k
2
−
16
k
+
16
(2k−4) 
2
 =4k 
2
 −16k+16

(
−
3
k
−
7
)
2
=
9
k
2
+
42
k
+
49
(−3k−7) 
2
 =9k 
2
 +42k+49

adding them:

4
k
2
−
16
k
+
16
+
9
k
2
+
42
k
+
49
=
13
k
2
+
26
k
+
65
4k 
2
 −16k+16+9k 
2
 +42k+49=13k 
2
 +26k+65

set equal to 52:

13
k
2
+
26
k
+
13
=
0
13k 
2
 +26k+13=0

divide by 13:

k
2
+
2
k
+
1
=
0
k 
2
 +2k+1=0

which is 
(
k
+
1
)
2
=
0
(k+1) 
2
 =0, so 
k
=
−
1
k=−1.

seems correct. maybe there's only one solution.

alternatively, perhaps i should consider that the norm can be positive or negative, but since it's a distance, it's always positive, so no need to consider negative values for the norm.

alternatively, perhaps there are complex solutions, but the problem asks for real numbers.

alternatively, maybe i should check if 
k
=
−
1
k=−1 indeed satisfies the original equation.

let's plug 
k
=
−
1
k=−1 back into the original expression:

−
1
(
2
−
3
 
)
−
(
4
7
 
)
=
(
−
2
3
 
)
−
(
4
7
 
)
=
(
−
6
−
4
 
)
−1( 
2
−3
​	
 )−( 
4
7
​	
 )=( 
−2
3
​	
 )−( 
4
7
​	
 )=( 
−6
−4
​	
 )

the norm is 
(
−
6
)
2
+
(
−
4
)
2
=
36
+
16
=
52
=
2
13
(−6) 
2
 +(−4) 
2
 
​	
 = 
36+16
​	
 = 
52
​	
 =2 
13
​	
 , which matches the given value.

so, it does satisfy the equation.

since the quadratic equation only has one real solution, and it satisfies the original equation, i think 
k
=
−
1
k=−1 is the only real solution.

therefore, the answer is 
−
1
−1
​	
 .

**final answer**

−1
