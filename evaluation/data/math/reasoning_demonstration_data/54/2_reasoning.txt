Reasoning: 
So i need to evaluate 
log
⁡
5
625
log 
5
​
 625. hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but let's see what i can do. first, i remember that a logarithm 
log
⁡
b
a
log 
b
​
 a answers the question: "to what power must i raise 
b
b to get 
a
a?" so, in this case, it's asking, "5 raised to what power equals 625?"

let me write that down:

5
x
=
625
5 
x
 =625
i need to solve for 
x
x. i know that 5 raised to some integer powers gives me:

- 
5
1
=
5
5 
1
 =5

- 
5
2
=
25
5 
2
 =25

- 
5
3
=
125
5 
3
 =125

- 
5
4
=
625
5 
4
 =625

oh, so 
5
4
=
625
5 
4
 =625. that means 
x
=
4
x=4, right? so, 
log
⁡
5
625
=
4
log 
5
​
 625=4.

wait, is there another way to confirm this? maybe i can use the change of base formula. the change of base formula says:

log
⁡
b
a
=
log
⁡
c
a
log
⁡
c
b
log 
b
​
 a= 
log 
c
​
 b
log 
c
​
 a
​
 
for any positive 
c
c not equal to 1. let's choose base 10 for simplicity.

so,

log
⁡
5
625
=
log
⁡
10
625
log
⁡
10
5
log 
5
​
 625= 
log 
10
​
 5
log 
10
​
 625
​
 
i know that 
log
⁡
10
625
log 
10
​
 625 is the logarithm of 625 in base 10, and 
log
⁡
10
5
log 
10
​
 5 is the logarithm of 5 in base 10. but calculating these directly might not be straightforward without a calculator. maybe i can express 625 as a power of 5 to make it easier.

wait, i already did that earlier and found that 
5
4
=
625
5 
4
 =625. so, plugging back into the change of base formula:

log
⁡
5
625
=
log
⁡
10
(
5
4
)
log
⁡
10
5
=
4
⋅
log
⁡
10
5
log
⁡
10
5
=
4
log 
5
​
 625= 
log 
10
​
 5
log 
10
​
 (5 
4
 )
​
 = 
log 
10
​
 5
4⋅log 
10
​
 5
​
 =4
that confirms my earlier result. so, 
log
⁡
5
625
=
4
log 
5
​
 625=4.

is there another method to approach this? maybe using natural logarithms? let's try that.

using natural logarithms (base 
e
e):

log
⁡
5
625
=
ln
⁡
625
ln
⁡
5
log 
5
​
 625= 
ln5
ln625
​
 
again, since 
625
=
5
4
625=5 
4
 , then 
ln
⁡
625
=
ln
⁡
(
5
4
)
=
4
ln
⁡
5
ln625=ln(5 
4
 )=4ln5. plugging that in:

log
⁡
5
625
=
4
ln
⁡
5
ln
⁡
5
=
4
log 
5
​
 625= 
ln5
4ln5
​
 =4
once more, i get 4. it seems consistent across different methods.

let me think about the definition again. the logarithm 
log
⁡
b
a
log 
b
​
 a is the exponent to which the base 
b
b must be raised to produce 
a
a. so, in this case, since 
5
4
=
625
5 
4
 =625, it's clear that the exponent is 4.

i wonder if there's a way to express 625 in terms of other bases and see if that changes anything, but i don't think that's necessary here because 625 is a perfect power of 5.

maybe i can check if 625 has any other factors that are powers of 5. let's factorize 625:

625 divided by 5 is 125.

125 divided by 5 is 25.

25 divided by 5 is 5.

5 divided by 5 is 1.

so, 
625
=
5
×
5
×
5
×
5
=
5
4
625=5×5×5×5=5 
4
 .

this again confirms that 
5
4
=
625
5 
4
 =625, so 
log
⁡
5
625
=
4
log 
5
​
 625=4.

is there any chance that the logarithm could be a different value? well, considering that logarithms are functions and each input corresponds to exactly one output, and since 5 raised to 4 is uniquely 625, there shouldn't be any other value for 
x
x that satisfies 
5
x
=
625
5 
x
 =625.

let me consider if there are any properties of logarithms that i can apply here. for example, the power rule:

log
⁡
b
(
a
c
)
=
c
⋅
log
⁡
b
a
log 
b
​
 (a 
c
 )=c⋅log 
b
​
 a
but in this case, since 625 is 
5
4
5 
4
 , and i'm taking 
log
⁡
5
log 
5
​
  of that, it simplifies directly to 4, as shown earlier.

another property is that 
log
⁡
b
b
=
1
log 
b
​
 b=1, which makes sense because 
b
1
=
b
b 
1
 =b. extending that, 
log
⁡
b
(
b
k
)
=
k
log 
b
​
 (b 
k
 )=k, which is exactly what we're dealing with here, where 
k
=
4
k=4.

i think i've covered all the bases here. multiple methods lead me to the same conclusion that 
log
⁡
5
625
=
4
log 
5
​
 625=4.

just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any alternative interpretation of the problem. could there be a scenario where 
log
⁡
5
625
log 
5
​
 625 is not 4? well, if the base were different or if 625 were not a power of 5, but in this case, both are constants, and 625 is indeed a power of 5.

maybe i can plot the function 
y
=
5
x
y=5 
x
  and see where it intersects with 
y
=
625
y=625. at 
x
=
4
x=4, 
5
4
=
625
5 
4
 =625, so that's the point of intersection, confirming that 
log
⁡
5
625
=
4
log 
5
​
 625=4.

alternatively, if i think about the inverse functions, the logarithm is the inverse of the exponential function. so, 
y
=
log
⁡
5
x
y=log 
5
​
 x is the inverse of 
y
=
5
x
y=5 
x
 . this means that if 
y
=
5
x
y=5 
x
 , then 
x
=
log
⁡
5
y
x=log 
5
​
 y. plugging in 
y
=
625
y=625, i get 
x
=
log
⁡
5
625
=
4
x=log 
5
​
 625=4, which aligns with what i've found.

i could also consider the change of base formula with a different base, say base 2, just for fun.

log
⁡
5
625
=
log
⁡
2
625
log
⁡
2
5
log 
5
​
 625= 
log 
2
​
 5
log 
2
​
 625
​
 
but since 625 is 
5
4
5 
4
 , 
log
⁡
2
625
=
log
⁡
2
(
5
4
)
=
4
log
⁡
2
5
log 
2
​
 625=log 
2
​
 (5 
4
 )=4log 
2
​
 5, so:

log
⁡
5
625
=
4
log
⁡
2
5
log
⁡
2
5
=
4
log 
5
​
 625= 
log 
2
​
 5
4log 
2
​
 5
​
 =4
again, 4 shows up. it seems no matter which base i choose for the change of base formula, the result is consistently 4.

is there any way this could be wrong? well, if i miscalculated somewhere, but i don't see any errors in my steps. all the methods i've used point to the same answer.

maybe i can think about logarithms in terms of exponents on a logarithmic scale. on a logarithmic scale with base 5, the number 625 would be at position 4, since it's 
5
4
5 
4
 . that makes sense.

alternatively, if i consider the definition of logarithms in terms of integrals, 
log
⁡
b
a
=
∫
1
a
1
x
ln
⁡
b
d
x
log 
b
​
 a=∫ 
1
a
​
  
xlnb
1
​
 dx, but that seems too advanced for this problem, and it's probably unnecessary to go into calculus for evaluating a simple logarithm.

perhaps i can explore if there are any logarithmic identities that could be applied here, but again, since 625 is a straightforward power of 5, it doesn't seem necessary.

let me just recap:

- direct exponentiation: 
5
4
=
625
5 
4
 =625, so 
log
⁡
5
625
=
4
log 
5
​
 625=4.

- change of base formula with base 10: 
log
⁡
5
625
=
log
⁡
10
625
log
⁡
10
5
=
4
log 
5
​
 625= 
log 
10
​
 5
log 
10
​
 625
​
 =4.

- change of base formula with base 
e
e: 
log
⁡
5
625
=
ln
⁡
625
ln
⁡
5
=
4
log 
5
​
 625= 
ln5
ln625
​
 =4.

- properties of logarithms and exponents confirm this result.

given all these confirmations, i'm confident that the answer is indeed 4.

i suppose i could also think about this in terms of logarithmic graphs or use a calculator to verify, but since 625 is a perfect power of 5, a calculator isn't necessary here.

in summary, through multiple approaches and confirmations, i've determined that 
log
⁡
5
625
=
4
log 
5
​
 625=4.

**final answer**
