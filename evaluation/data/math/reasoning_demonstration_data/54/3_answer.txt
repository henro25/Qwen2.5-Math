Answer: To evaluate \(\log_5 625\), we need to determine the power to which 5 must be raised to obtain 625. this can be expressed as:

\[
5^x = 625
\]

by recognizing that \(5^4 = 625\), we find that \(x = 4\). therefore, \(\log_5 625 = 4\).

to confirm this result, we can use the change of base formula:

\[
\log_5 625 = \frac{\log_{10} 625}{\log_{10} 5}
\]

since \(625 = 5^4\), we have:

\[
\log_{10} 625 = \log_{10} (5^4) = 4 \log_{10} 5
\]

thus,

\[
\log_5 625 = \frac{4 \log_{10} 5}{\log_{10} 5} = 4
\]

using natural logarithms (base \(e\)):

\[
\log_5 625 = \frac{\ln 625}{\ln 5}
\]

again, since \(625 = 5^4\), we have:

\[
\ln 625 = \ln (5^4) = 4 \ln 5
\]

thus,

\[
\log_5 625 = \frac{4 \ln 5}{\ln 5} = 4
\]

both methods confirm that \(\log_5 625 = 4\).

therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]
