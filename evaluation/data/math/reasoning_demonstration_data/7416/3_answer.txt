Answer: 1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Triangle ABC is isosceles with angle A congruent to angle B.
   - Angle C is 30 degrees more than angle A.

2. **Set up variables:**
   - Let angle A = angle B = x degrees.
   - Then, angle C = x + 30 degrees.

3. **Use the triangle angle sum property:**
   - The sum of the interior angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
   - Therefore, angle A + angle B + angle C = 180 degrees.

4. **Substitute the variables into the equation:**
   - x + x + (x + 30) = 180

5. **Simplify and solve for x:**
   - 3x + 30 = 180
   - 3x = 150
   - x = 50

6. **Find the measure of angle C:**
   - Angle C = x + 30 = 50 + 30 = 80 degrees.

**Answer:** The measure of angle C is 80 degrees.
