Reasoning: Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. It says that triangle ABC is isosceles, and angle A is congruent to angle B. That means angles A and B are equal, right? And angle C is 30 degrees more than angle A. I need to find the measure of angle C.

Alright, let's start by recalling some basic facts about triangles. In any triangle, the sum of the interior angles is always 180 degrees. So, if I add up angles A, B, and C, it should equal 180 degrees.

Since angle A is congruent to angle B, I can say that angle A equals angle B. Let's call the measure of angle A "x" degrees. That means angle B is also "x" degrees.

Now, angle C is 30 degrees more than angle A. So, angle C would be "x + 30" degrees.

So, putting it all together, the sum of the angles should be:

Angle A + Angle B + Angle C = 180 degrees

Which is:

x + x + (x + 30) = 180

Combining like terms:

3x + 30 = 180

Now, I need to solve for x. So, I'll subtract 30 from both sides:

3x = 150

Then, divide both sides by 3:

x = 50

So, angle A is 50 degrees, and since angle B is equal to angle A, angle B is also 50 degrees.

Now, angle C is 30 degrees more than angle A, so:

Angle C = 50 + 30 = 80 degrees

Let me just double-check to make sure everything adds up correctly:

50 (A) + 50 (B) + 80 (C) = 180 degrees

Yes, that adds up to 180 degrees, so it checks out.

I think that's the answer. Angle C is 80 degrees.
