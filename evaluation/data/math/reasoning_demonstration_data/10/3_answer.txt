Answer: To find the sum of the proper divisors of 432, we start with its prime factorization:

\[
432 = 2^4 \times 3^3
\]

the sum of all divisors of a number is given by the product of the sums of the geometric series of its prime factors:

\[
\text{sum of divisors} = \left( \frac{2^{4+1} - 1}{2 - 1} \right) \times \left( \frac{3^{3+1} - 1}{3 - 1} \right) = (31) \times (40) = 1240
\]

to find the sum of the proper divisors, we subtract the number itself from the sum of all divisors:

\[
\text{sum of proper divisors} = 1240 - 432 = 808
\]

thus, the sum of the proper divisors of 432 is:

\[
\boxed{808}
\]
