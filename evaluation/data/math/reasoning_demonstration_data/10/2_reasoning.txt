Reasoning: So i have this problem: "a divisor of a number is a proper divisor if it is not equal to the number. what is the sum of the proper divisors of 432?" okay, first things first, i need to understand what a proper divisor is. from the definition, it's any divisor of the number except the number itself. so, for 432, i need to find all the numbers that divide 432 evenly, excluding 432, and then add them up.

i think a good starting point would be to find all the divisors of 432. to do that, it's helpful to have the prime factorization of 432. let's factorize 432.

i know that 432 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. let's divide 432 by 2:

432 ÷ 2 = 216

216 is also even, so divide by 2 again:

216 ÷ 2 = 108

108 is still even:

108 ÷ 2 = 54

54 ÷ 2 = 27

27 is not even, so i can't divide by 2 anymore. now, 27 is divisible by 3:

27 ÷ 3 = 9

9 ÷ 3 = 3

3 ÷ 3 = 1

so, the prime factors are 2^4 * 3^3, since i divided by 2 four times and by 3 three times.

now, to find all the divisors of 432, i can use the exponents of the prime factors. the formula for the number of divisors is (a+1)(b+1)... where a, b, etc., are the exponents in the prime factorization. so, for 2^4 * 3^3, the number of divisors is (4+1)(3+1) = 5*4 = 20 divisors. but i don't just need the count; i need the actual divisors.

alternatively, i can find the sum of all divisors and then subtract the number itself to get the sum of proper divisors. the formula for the sum of divisors is (p^(a+1) - 1)/(p - 1) for each prime p raised to power a, and then multiply these sums together for all prime factors.

so, for 2^4, the sum of divisors is (2^(4+1) - 1)/(2 - 1) = (32 - 1)/1 = 31

for 3^3, it's (3^(3+1) - 1)/(3 - 1) = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40

then, the sum of all divisors is 31 * 40 = 1240

since proper divisors exclude the number itself, which is 432, the sum of proper divisors is 1240 - 432 = 808

wait a minute, let me double-check that calculation to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

first, confirm the prime factorization of 432:

432 ÷ 2 = 216

216 ÷ 2 = 108

108 ÷ 2 = 54

54 ÷ 2 = 27

27 ÷ 3 = 9

9 ÷ 3 = 3

3 ÷ 3 = 1

so yes, 2^4 * 3^3 is correct.

next, sum of divisors formula:

for 2^4: (2^5 - 1)/(2 - 1) = 31/1 = 31

for 3^3: (3^4 - 1)/(3 - 1) = 80/2 = 40

sum of all divisors: 31 * 40 = 1240

sum of proper divisors: 1240 - 432 = 808

hmm, seems consistent. maybe i can try listing some divisors to see if it makes sense.

let's list the divisors of 432:

starting with 1 (since 1 is a divisor of every number).

then, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 27, 36, 48, 54, 72, 108, 144, 216, and 432.

wait, that's 19 divisors, but earlier i calculated 20 divisors. did i miss one?

let me list them again:

1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 27, 36, 48, 54, 72, 108, 144, 216, 432

yes, that's 20 divisors. okay, so sum of all divisors is 1240, and sum of proper divisors is 1240 - 432 = 808.

alternatively, maybe i can add up the divisors i listed and see if it totals 1240.

let's add them:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 + 4 = 10

10 + 6 = 16

16 + 8 = 24

24 + 9 = 33

33 + 12 = 45

45 + 16 = 61

61 + 18 = 79

79 + 24 = 103

103 + 27 = 130

130 + 36 = 166

166 + 48 = 214

214 + 54 = 268

268 + 72 = 340

340 + 108 = 448

448 + 144 = 592

592 + 216 = 808

808 + 432 = 1240

yes, that matches the earlier calculation. so, the sum of all divisors is indeed 1240, and the sum of proper divisors is 808.

i think that's the answer. but to be thorough, maybe i can try another method to verify.

another way is to list all the proper divisors and add them up directly.

proper divisors of 432 are all divisors except 432 itself.

from the list above, they are:

1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 27, 36, 48, 54, 72, 108, 144, 216

now, add them up:

1 + 2 = 3

3 + 3 = 6

6 + 4 = 10

10 + 6 = 16

16 + 8 = 24

24 + 9 = 33

33 + 12 = 45

45 + 16 = 61

61 + 18 = 79

79 + 24 = 103

103 + 27 = 130

130 + 36 = 166

166 + 48 = 214

214 + 54 = 268

268 + 72 = 340

340 + 108 = 448

448 + 144 = 592

592 + 216 = 808

again, 808. consistent with previous results.

so, the sum of the proper divisors of 432 is 808.

**final answer**
