Problem: In the diagram, each circle is divided into two equal areas and $O$ is the center of the larger circle. The area of the larger circle is $64\pi.$ What is the total area of the shaded regions? [asy]
size(100);
import graph;
fill(Arc((0,0),2,180,360)--cycle,mediumgray);fill(Arc((0,1),1,0,180)--cycle,mediumgray);
draw(Circle((0,0),2));
draw(Circle((0,1),1));

dot((0,0)); label("$O$",(0,0),N);
draw((-2,0)--(2,0)); draw((-1,1)--(1,1));
