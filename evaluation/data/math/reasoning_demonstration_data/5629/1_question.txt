Problem: Albert starts to make a list, in increasing order, of the positive integers that have a first digit of 1. He writes $1, 10, 11, 12, \ldots$ but by the 1,000th digit he (finally) realizes that the list would contain an infinite number of elements. Find the three-digit number formed by the last three digits he wrote (the 998th, 999th, and 1000th digits, in that order).
