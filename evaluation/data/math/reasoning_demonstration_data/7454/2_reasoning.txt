Reasoning: Alright, I need to find the greatest common divisor of 1407 and 903. Let's see, the greatest common divisor, or GCD, is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. There are a few ways to approach this. One method is the Euclidean algorithm, which is pretty efficient for larger numbers.

First, I'll try to recall how the Euclidean algorithm works. I think it involves dividing the larger number by the smaller one and then repeating the process with the remainder until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder should be the GCD.

So, starting with 1407 and 903. I'll divide 1407 by 903. Let's see, 903 times 1 is 903, and 1407 minus 903 is 504. So, the remainder is 504.

Now, I take 903 and divide it by 504. 504 times 1 is 504, and 903 minus 504 is 399. So, the remainder is 399.

Next, I divide 504 by 399. 399 times 1 is 399, and 504 minus 399 is 105. Remainder is 105.

Then, I divide 399 by 105. 105 times 3 is 315, and 399 minus 315 is 84. Remainder is 84.

Now, divide 105 by 84. 84 times 1 is 84, and 105 minus 84 is 21. Remainder is 21.

Finally, divide 84 by 21. 21 times 4 is 84, and 84 minus 84 is 0. So, the remainder is 0.

Since the last non-zero remainder is 21, that should be the GCD of 1407 and 903.

Wait, let me double-check if 21 actually divides both 1407 and 903.

1407 divided by 21 is 67, because 21 times 60 is 1260, and 1407 minus 1260 is 147, which is 21 times 7, so total 67.

903 divided by 21 is 43, because 21 times 40 is 840, and 903 minus 840 is 63, which is 21 times 3, so total 43.

Yes, both divisions result in whole numbers, so 21 is indeed a common divisor. I don't think there's a larger number that divides both since we used the Euclidean algorithm, which is supposed to give the greatest common divisor.

I think that's it. The GCD of 1407 and 903 is 21.
