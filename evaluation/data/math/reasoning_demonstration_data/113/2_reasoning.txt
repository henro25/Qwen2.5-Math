Reasoning: So i have this problem here. it says: "the line 
x
=
k
x=k intersects the graph of the parabola 
x
=
−
2
y
2
−
3
y
+
5
x=−2y 
2
 −3y+5 at exactly one point. what is 
k
k?" alright, let's see. i need to find the value of 
k
k such that the vertical line 
x
=
k
x=k touches the parabola at only one point.

first off, i know that the equation 
x
=
k
x=k represents a vertical line that's parallel to the y-axis and crosses the x-axis at 
x
=
k
x=k. the parabola is given by 
x
=
−
2
y
2
−
3
y
+
5
x=−2y 
2
 −3y+5, which is a bit unusual because it's expressed in terms of 
y
y, meaning it's a parabola that opens either to the left or the right, not up or down.

to find where they intersect, i can set 
x
=
k
x=k equal to the equation of the parabola, so:

k
=
−
2
y
2
−
3
y
+
5
k=−2y 
2
 −3y+5
now, this is a quadratic equation in terms of 
y
y. if i rearrange it, it looks like:

−
2
y
2
−
3
y
+
(
5
−
k
)
=
0
−2y 
2
 −3y+(5−k)=0
or, to make it a bit cleaner, i can multiply both sides by -1 to get:

2
y
2
+
3
y
−
(
5
−
k
)
=
0
2y 
2
 +3y−(5−k)=0
so, the equation is:

2
y
2
+
3
y
−
(
5
−
k
)
=
0
2y 
2
 +3y−(5−k)=0
now, for a quadratic equation of the form 
a
y
2
+
b
y
+
c
=
0
ay 
2
 +by+c=0, there is exactly one real solution when the discriminant is zero. the discriminant 
d
d is given by 
d
=
b
2
−
4
a
c
d=b 
2
 −4ac. so, in this case, 
a
=
2
a=2, 
b
=
3
b=3, and 
c
=
−
(
5
−
k
)
c=−(5−k), which is 
c
=
k
−
5
c=k−5.

so, the discriminant is:

d
=
3
2
−
4
(
2
)
(
k
−
5
)
=
9
−
8
(
k
−
5
)
d=3 
2
 −4(2)(k−5)=9−8(k−5)
simplifying that:

d
=
9
−
8
k
+
40
=
49
−
8
k
d=9−8k+40=49−8k
for there to be exactly one intersection point, the discriminant must be zero:

49
−
8
k
=
0
49−8k=0
solving for 
k
k:

8
k
=
49
k
=
49
8
8k=49
k= 
8
49
​
 
so, 
k
=
49
8
k= 
8
49
​
 .

wait a second, let me just double-check that i did everything correctly. i set the equations equal to each other, rearranged into a standard quadratic form, identified the coefficients correctly, calculated the discriminant, set it to zero, and solved for 
k
k. yeah, that seems right.

alternatively, thinking about the geometry of the situation, the line 
x
=
k
x=k is vertical, and the parabola 
x
=
−
2
y
2
−
3
y
+
5
x=−2y 
2
 −3y+5 is a sideways parabola opening to the left since the coefficient of 
y
2
y 
2
  is negative. the vertex of this parabola would be the point where the parabola changes direction, and that should be the point where the vertical line 
x
=
k
x=k touches it if it's tangent.

to find the vertex of the parabola, i can use the formula for the vertex of a parabola in the form 
x
=
a
y
2
+
b
y
+
c
x=ay 
2
 +by+c. the y-coordinate of the vertex is given by 
y
=
−
b
2
a
y=− 
2a
b
​
 , and then i can plug that back into the equation to find the x-coordinate.

given 
x
=
−
2
y
2
−
3
y
+
5
x=−2y 
2
 −3y+5, so 
a
=
−
2
a=−2, 
b
=
−
3
b=−3, and 
c
=
5
c=5.

the y-coordinate of the vertex is:

y
=
−
−
3
2
(
−

)
=

−

=
−
3

y=− 
2(−2)
−3
​
 = 
−4
3
​
 =− 
4
3
​
 
now, plugging 
y
=
−
3
4
y=− 
4
3
​
  back into the equation to find 
x
x:

x
=
−
2
(
−

2

(
−

)
+
5
x=−2(−

​
 ) 
2
 −3(−

​
 )+5
calculating step by step:

first, 
(
−

4
)
2
=
9
16
(− 
4
3
​
 ) 
2
 = 
16

​
 , so:

x
=
−

⋅
9

(
−

=

simplifying fractions:

​
 ,

​
 =

​
 ,5=

​
 
so:

x

8
+
18
8

=

+
18
+

x=−

​
 + 
8
40
​
 = 
8
−9+18+40
​
 = 
8
49
​
 
so, the vertex is at 
(
49
8
,
−
3
4
)
( 
8
49
​
 ,− 
4
3
​
 ). since the parabola opens to the left, the vertex is the rightmost point of the parabola. therefore, the line 
x
=
k
x=k will intersect the parabola at exactly one point only when 
k
=
49
8
k= 
8
49
​
 , which is the x-coordinate of the vertex. if 
k
k were greater than 
49
8
8
49
​
 , the line would not intersect the parabola at all, and if 
k
k were less than 
49
8
8
49
​
 , it would intersect at two points.

this confirms the earlier calculation using the discriminant method. both approaches lead to the same conclusion, so i'm confident that 
k
=
49
8
k= 
8
49
​
  is the correct answer.

just to be thorough, let's consider what the graph looks like. the parabola 
x
=
−
2
y
2
−
3
y
+
5
x=−2y 
2
 −3y+5 opens to the left, and its vertex is at 
(
49
8
,
−
3
4
)
( 
8
49
​
 ,− 
4
3
​
 ). the line 
x
=
k
x=k is vertical, and it moves left or right depending on the value of 
k
k. when 
k
k is exactly the x-coordinate of the vertex, the line just touches the parabola at that single point. for any other 
k
k, it either doesn't intersect the parabola or intersects it at two points.

i think that's a solid understanding of the problem. i've approached it from two angles: algebraically using the discriminant and geometrically by finding the vertex. both methods agree, so i'm pretty sure that 
k
=
49
8
k= 
8
49
​
  is the correct answer.

**final answer**
