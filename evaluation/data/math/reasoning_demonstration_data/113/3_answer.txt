Answer: To find the value of \( k \) such that the line \( x = k \) intersects the parabola \( x = -2y^2 - 3y + 5 \) at exactly one point, we start by setting the equations equal to each other:

\[
k = -2y^2 - 3y + 5
\]

rearranging this into a standard quadratic form gives:

\[
2y^2 + 3y - (5 - k) = 0
\]

for the quadratic equation \( 2y^2 + 3y - (5 - k) = 0 \) to have exactly one real solution, the discriminant must be zero. the discriminant \( d \) is given by:

\[
d = b^2 - 4ac
\]

here, \( a = 2 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = -(5 - k) = k - 5 \). thus, the discriminant is:

\[
d = 3^2 - 4(2)(k - 5) = 9 - 8(k - 5) = 9 - 8k + 40 = 49 - 8k
\]

setting the discriminant to zero for exactly one solution:

\[
49 - 8k = 0
\]

solving for \( k \):

\[
8k = 49 \\
k = \frac{49}{8}
\]

to confirm, we find the vertex of the parabola \( x = -2y^2 - 3y + 5 \). the y-coordinate of the vertex is:

\[
y = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{-3}{2(-2)} = -\frac{3}{4}
\]

substituting \( y = -\frac{3}{4} \) back into the parabola equation to find the x-coordinate:

\[
x = -2\left(-\frac{3}{4}\right)^2 - 3\left(-\frac{3}{4}\right) + 5 = -2 \cdot \frac{9}{16} + \frac{9}{4} + 5 = -\frac{9}{8} + \frac{18}{8} + \frac{40}{8} = \frac{49}{8}
\]

thus, the vertex is at \( \left( \frac{49}{8}, -\frac{3}{4} \right) \), confirming that \( k = \frac{49}{8} \) is the correct value for the line to intersect the parabola at exactly one point.

\[
\boxed{\frac{49}{8}}
\]
