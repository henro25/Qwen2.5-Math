Problem: Let \[f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\frac{x}{21} & \text{ if }x\text{ is a multiple of 3 and 7}, \\
3x & \text{ if }x\text{ is only a multiple of 7}, \\
7x & \text{ if }x\text{ is only a multiple of 3}, \\
x+3 & \text{ if }x\text{ is not a multiple of 3 or 7}.
\end{array}
\right.\]If $f^a(x)$ means the function is nested $a$ times (for example, $f^2(x)=f(f(x))$), what is the smallest value of $a$ greater than 1 that satisfies $f(2)=f^a(2)$?
