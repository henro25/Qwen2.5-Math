Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: "if 
x
x is a positive multiple of 8 and 
x
2
>
100
x 
2
 >100, but 
x
<
20
x<20, what is 
x
x?" okay, let's break this down step by step.

first off, 
x
x is a positive multiple of 8. so, multiples of 8 are numbers like 8, 16, 24, 32, and so on. but wait, it also says 
x
<
20
x<20, so that narrows it down a bit. if i list out the positive multiples of 8 that are less than 20, i have 8 and 16. okay, so 
x
x could be either 8 or 16.

next, there's this condition that 
x
2
>
100
x 
2
 >100. so, i need to check which of these possible 
x
x values satisfy that inequality. let's calculate 
8
2
8 
2
  and 
1
6
2
16 
2
 .

8
2
=
64
8 
2
 =64. hmm, 64 is not greater than 100. so, 8 doesn't work.

now, 
1
6
2
=
256
16 
2
 =256, which is definitely greater than 100. so, 16 satisfies the condition.

wait a minute, let me make sure there aren't any other multiples of 8 between 8 and 20 that i might have missed. the next multiple after 16 would be 24, but 24 is greater than 20, so it's out of range. yeah, so the only possible values for 
x
x are 8 and 16, and only 16 satisfies 
x
2
>
100
x 
2
 >100.

but just to be thorough, let me double-check the inequalities. the problem says 
x
2
>
100
x 
2
 >100 and 
x
<
20
x<20, with 
x
x being a positive multiple of 8.

so, for 
x
=
8
x=8: 
8
2
=
64
8 
2
 =64, which is not greater than 100. doesn't work.

for 
x
=
16
x=16: 
1
6
2
=
256
16 
2
 =256, which is greater than 100. perfect.

are there any other considerations? well, the problem specifies that 
x
x is positive, so negative multiples of 8 aren't in play here. also, since 
x
x has to be less than 20, 24 is too big.

is there any chance that there are fractions or decimals involved? the problem says "multiple of 8," which typically implies integer multiples unless otherwise specified. so, i think sticking with integers is safe here.

just to explore a bit more, what if 
x
x wasn't restricted to being an integer? then, technically, there could be fractions or decimals that are multiples of 8 and satisfy the conditions. but given the context and the way the problem is phrased, i think assuming integer values is appropriate.

also, considering that 16 is less than 20 and its square is greater than 100, and 8 doesn't satisfy the square condition, it seems clear that 16 is the answer.

let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by solving the inequalities directly.

we have:

1. 
x
x is a positive multiple of 8: 
x
=
8
k
x=8k, where 
k
k is a positive integer.

2. 
x
2
>
100
x 
2
 >100: plugging in 
x
=
8
k
x=8k, we get 
(
8
k
)
2
>
100
(8k) 
2
 >100 → 
64
k
2
>
100
64k 
2
 >100 → 
k
2
>
100
64
k 
2
 > 
64
100
​	
  → 
k
2
>
1.5625
k 
2
 >1.5625 → 
k
>
1.5625
k> 
1.5625
​	
  → 
k
>
1.25
k>1.25.

since 
k
k is a positive integer, the smallest possible value for 
k
k is 2 (since 1.25 is not an integer, and 
k
k must be greater than 1.25).

therefore, 
k
=
2
k=2, which means 
x
=
8
×
2
=
16
x=8×2=16.

this confirms my earlier conclusion that 
x
=
16
x=16.

is there anything else i should consider? maybe checking if there are any other constraints or if i've misread the problem.

the problem says "if 
x
x is a positive multiple of 8 and 
x
2
>
100
x 
2
 >100, but 
x
<
20
x<20, what is 
x
x?"

i think i've covered all parts: positive multiple of 8, square greater than 100, and less than 20.

alternatively, i could consider graphing the functions to visualize the solution, but that might be overkill for this problem.

let's see: graphing 
y
=
x
2
y=x 
2
  and drawing the line 
y
=
100
y=100, and finding where 
x
2
>
100
x 
2
 >100 with 
x
<
20
x<20 and 
x
x being a multiple of 8.

from the graph, 
x
2
>
100
x 
2
 >100 when 
x
>
10
x>10 or 
x
<
−
10
x<−10, but since 
x
x is positive, we only consider 
x
>
10
x>10.

combining this with 
x
<
20
x<20, we have 
10
<
x
<
20
10<x<20.

and among the multiples of 8 in this range, only 16 fits.

so, again, 
x
=
16
x=16.

is there a way this could have multiple solutions? well, if there were more multiples of 8 between 10 and 20, but as we've seen, only 16 is in that range.

wait, let's list the multiples of 8 again: 8, 16, 24, 32,...

8 is less than 10, so it doesn't satisfy 
x
2
>
100
x 
2
 >100, and 16 is between 10 and 20 and satisfies the condition, and 24 is above 20, which is out of range.

so, only 16 is valid.

i think that's pretty much it. i can't see any other possible values for 
x
x that would satisfy all the given conditions.

just to recap:

- multiples of 8 less than 20: 8 and 16.

- check 
x
2
>
100
x 
2
 >100:

- 
8
2
=
64
8 
2
 =64, which is not greater than 100.

- 
1
6
2
=
256
16 
2
 =256, which is greater than 100.

therefore, the only value of 
x
x that satisfies all the conditions is 16.

i feel confident with this answer now.

**final answer**

16
