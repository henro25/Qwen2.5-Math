Answer: Given that \( x \) is a positive multiple of 8, \( x^2 > 100 \), and \( x < 20 \), we need to find the value of \( x \).

first, we list the positive multiples of 8 that are less than 20:
\[ 8, 16 \]

next, we check which of these values satisfy \( x^2 > 100 \):

for \( x = 8 \):
\[ 8^2 = 64 \]
since \( 64 \) is not greater than 100, \( x = 8 \) does not work.

for \( x = 16 \):
\[ 16^2 = 256 \]
since \( 256 \) is greater than 100, \( x = 16 \) works.

to confirm, we solve the inequality \( x^2 > 100 \) with \( x = 8k \) where \( k \) is a positive integer:
\[ (8k)^2 > 100 \]
\[ 64k^2 > 100 \]
\[ k^2 > \frac{100}{64} \]
\[ k^2 > 1.5625 \]
\[ k > \sqrt{1.5625} \]
\[ k > 1.25 \]

since \( k \) must be an integer, the smallest possible value for \( k \) is 2:
\[ x = 8 \times 2 = 16 \]

thus, the only value of \( x \) that satisfies all the conditions is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]
