Answer: To find the range of \( f(x) - x \) for \( -3 \le x \le 3 \), we analyze the function \( g(x) = f(x) - x \) based on the given graph of \( y = f(x) \).

the function \( f(x) \) is piecewise constant with the following values:
- for \( x \in [-3, -2) \), \( f(x) = -3 \)
- for \( x \in [-2, -1) \), \( f(x) = -2 \)
- for \( x \in [-1, 0) \), \( f(x) = -1 \)
- for \( x \in [0, 1) \), \( f(x) = 0 \)
- for \( x \in [1, 2) \), \( f(x) = 1 \)
- for \( x \in [2, 3) \), \( f(x) = 2 \)
- at \( x = 3 \), \( f(3) = 3 \)

we calculate \( g(x) = f(x) - x \) for each interval:
1. for \( x \in [-3, -2) \), \( g(x) = -3 - x \). as \( x \) varies from -3 to -2, \( g(x) \) ranges from 0 to -1.
2. for \( x \in [-2, -1) \), \( g(x) = -2 - x \). as \( x \) varies from -2 to -1, \( g(x) \) ranges from 0 to -1.
3. for \( x \in [-1, 0) \), \( g(x) = -1 - x \). as \( x \) varies from -1 to 0, \( g(x) \) ranges from 0 to -1.
4. for \( x \in [0, 1) \), \( g(x) = -x \). as \( x \) varies from 0 to 1, \( g(x) \) ranges from 0 to -1.
5. for \( x \in [1, 2) \), \( g(x) = 1 - x \). as \( x \) varies from 1 to 2, \( g(x) \) ranges from 0 to -1.
6. for \( x \in [2, 3) \), \( g(x) = 2 - x \). as \( x \) varies from 2 to 3, \( g(x) \) ranges from 0 to -1.
7. at \( x = 3 \), \( g(3) = 3 - 3 = 0 \).

in all intervals, \( g(x) \) approaches -1 but does not reach it, except in the limit. therefore, the range of \( g(x) \) is all real numbers greater than -1 and up to and including 0.

thus, the range of \( f(x) - x \) is \(\boxed{(-1, 0]}\).
