Reasoning: So i've got this problem here. there's a graph of y = f(x) for x between -3 and 3, and i need to find the range of f(x) - x on that interval. the graph is drawn with some red lines and dots, and there are open and closed dots, which probably indicate where the function is defined or not.

first, i need to understand what the graph looks like based on the asymptote code provided. it seems like there are horizontal line segments at different y-values between x = -3 and x = 3. there are closed dots at points like (-3,-3), (-2,-2), (-1,-1), (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3), and open dots at (-2,-3), (-1,-2), (0,-1), (1,0), (2,1), and (3,2).

from this, it looks like the function f(x) is defined piecewise with horizontal segments:

- from x = -3 to x = -2, y = -3

- from x = -2 to x = -1, y = -2

- from x = -1 to x = 0, y = -1

- from x = 0 to x = 1, y = 0

- from x = 1 to x = 2, y = 1

- from x = 2 to x = 3, y = 2

and there are open dots at the right endpoints of each segment, meaning that the function approaches but doesn't include those y-values at those x-values.

so, f(x) is a step function that increases by 1 every unit interval of x.

now, i need to find the range of f(x) - x on the interval from x = -3 to x = 3.

let's define g(x) = f(x) - x. so, g(x) = f(x) - x.

since f(x) is known on each interval, i can find g(x) on each interval by subtracting x from the constant value of f(x) on that interval.

let's list out the intervals and find g(x) for each:

1. for x in [-3, -2), f(x) = -3

so, g(x) = -3 - x

2. for x in [-2, -1), f(x) = -2

so, g(x) = -2 - x

3. for x in [-1, 0), f(x) = -1

so, g(x) = -1 - x

4. for x in [0, 1), f(x) = 0

so, g(x) = 0 - x = -x

5. for x in [1, 2), f(x) = 1

so, g(x) = 1 - x

6. for x in [2, 3), f(x) = 2

so, g(x) = 2 - x

wait, the asymptote code goes up to x = 3, and includes x = 3 with f(3) = 3, but there's an open dot at (3,3), which might mean that f(3) is not defined there, or perhaps it's defined as 2 from the previous segment. hmm, but according to the code, there's a dot at (3,3), which is filled, and at (3,2), which is open. so, likely, f(3) = 3.

but in the previous segments, at x = -2, x = -1, etc., the closed dot is at the left endpoint, and open at the right. so, f(x) is defined as the lower y-value at the left endpoint, and jumps up at each integer x.

but looking back, at x = 3, there's a closed dot at (3,3), so f(3) = 3.

similarly, at x = -3, f(-3) = -3, and so on.

so, back to g(x):

1. for x in [-3, -2), f(x) = -3

so, g(x) = -3 - x

since x is from -3 to -2, not including -2.

so, x ranges from -3 up to but not including -2.

therefore, g(x) = -3 - x, where x ∈ [-3, -2)

to find the range of g(x) on this interval, let's find the possible values of -3 - x as x varies from -3 to -2.

when x = -3, g(x) = -3 - (-3) = 0

as x increases towards -2, g(x) decreases:

when x approaches -2 from the left, g(x) approaches -3 - (-2) = -1

so, g(x) ranges from just above -1 to 0 on this interval.

therefore, on [-3, -2), g(x) ∈ (-1, 0]

2. for x in [-2, -1), f(x) = -2

so, g(x) = -2 - x

x ∈ [-2, -1)

when x = -2, g(x) = -2 - (-2) = 0

as x increases towards -1, g(x) decreases:

when x approaches -1 from the left, g(x) approaches -2 - (-1) = -1

so, g(x) ∈ (-1, 0] on this interval as well.

wait, but at x = -2, g(x) = 0, and as x increases to -1, g(x) decreases to -1.

so, similar to the first interval, g(x) ∈ (-1, 0]

3. for x in [-1, 0), f(x) = -1

so, g(x) = -1 - x

x ∈ [-1, 0)

at x = -1, g(x) = -1 - (-1) = 0

as x increases to 0, g(x) decreases to -1 - 0 = -1

so, g(x) ∈ (-1, 0]

4. for x in [0, 1), f(x) = 0

so, g(x) = 0 - x = -x

x ∈ [0, 1)

at x = 0, g(x) = 0

as x increases to 1, g(x) decreases to -1

so, g(x) ∈ (-1, 0]

5. for x in [1, 2), f(x) = 1

so, g(x) = 1 - x

x ∈ [1, 2)

at x = 1, g(x) = 1 - 1 = 0

as x increases to 2, g(x) decreases to 1 - 2 = -1

so, g(x) ∈ (-1, 0]

6. for x in [2, 3), f(x) = 2

so, g(x) = 2 - x

x ∈ [2, 3)

at x = 2, g(x) = 2 - 2 = 0

as x increases to 3, g(x) decreases to 2 - 3 = -1

so, g(x) ∈ (-1, 0]

wait a minute, in all these intervals, g(x) seems to range from -1 to 0.

but at x = 3, f(x) = 3, so g(x) = 3 - 3 = 0

so, at x = 3, g(x) = 0

so, including x = 3, g(x) = 0

but in the previous intervals, g(x) was approaching -1 but not reaching -1, except when x approaches 3 from the left, where g(x) approaches -1 from above.

wait, no.

wait, at x approaching 3 from the left, g(x) = 2 - x, so as x approaches 3 from below, g(x) approaches 2 - 3 = -1

but at x = 3, g(x) = 3 - 3 = 0

so, g(x) reaches 0 at x = 3.

but in all other intervals, g(x) ∈ (-1, 0]

so, including x = 3, g(x) = 0, which is already included in (-1, 0]

but, hold on, in the first interval, g(x) ∈ (-1, 0]

in the second, same

third, same

fourth, same

fifth, same

sixth, same

at x = 3, g(x) = 0, which is included in (-1, 0]

but, in the interval [2,3), g(x) approaches -1 as x approaches 3 from the left, and at x = 3, g(x) = 0.

so, overall, the range of g(x) seems to be from -1 to 0.

but wait, is there any point where g(x) is greater than 0?

at x = -3, g(x) = -3 - (-3) = 0

at x = -2, g(x) = -2 - (-2) = 0

similarly, at x = -1, g(x) = -1 - (-1) = 0

at x = 0, g(x) = 0 - 0 = 0

at x = 1, g(x) = 1 - 1 = 0

at x = 2, g(x) = 2 - 2 = 0

at x = 3, g(x) = 3 - 3 = 0

so, at all integer points, g(x) = 0

and in between, g(x) decreases to -1, but never goes below -1

wait, but in the first interval, from x = -3 to x = -2, g(x) = -3 - x

at x = -3, g(x) = 0

at x approaching -2 from the left, g(x) approaches -1

similarly, in each interval, g(x) decreases from 0 to -1

but does it ever reach -1?

in the open intervals, as x approaches the right endpoint, g(x) approaches -1, but doesn't include -1, except possibly at x = 3, but at x = 3, g(x) = 0

wait, no, at x = 3, g(x) = 0

so, in all intervals, g(x) approaches -1 but doesn't reach it, except perhaps in the limit

but since the function is defined at x = 3 with g(x) = 0, and in all other points, g(x) approaches -1 but doesn't reach it.

therefore, the range of g(x) is (-1, 0]

but wait, at x = -3, g(x) = 0

at x = -2, g(x) = 0

at x = -1, g(x) = 0

at x = 0, g(x) = 0

at x = 1, g(x) = 0

at x = 2, g(x) = 0

at x = 3, g(x) = 0

and in between, g(x) is decreasing from 0 to just above -1.

so, the lowest value of g(x) is approaching -1, but never actually reaches -1, except in the limit as x approaches the right endpoint of each interval.

but since x = 3 is included and g(3) = 0, the minimum value of g(x) is -1, but it's not achieved because in each open interval, g(x) approaches -1 but doesn't reach it.

wait, but in the interval [2,3), g(x) = 2 - x

as x approaches 3 from below, g(x) approaches -1

but x = 3 is included with g(3) = 0

so, the function g(x) gets arbitrarily close to -1 but never actually reaches -1, because at each right endpoint, the function jumps up to the next step.

therefore, the range of g(x) is all real numbers greater than -1 and up to and including 0.

so, in interval notation, that's (-1, 0]

but, to confirm, let's see if there's any x where g(x) is less than -1.

in all intervals, g(x) approaches -1 but doesn't go below it.

at x = 3, g(x) = 0

so, no, g(x) doesn't go below -1.

therefore, the range is (-1, 0]

but the problem says "express your answer in interval notation."

so, the range of f(x) - x is (-1, 0]

but, wait, the problem is multiple-choice or is it to be filled in?

no, it's to express the answer in interval notation.

so, i should write \boxed{(-1,0]}

wait, but in the asymptote code, there are points at (3,3), which is filled, and (3,2) which is open.

so, f(3) = 3, and in the interval [2,3), f(x) = 2, but at x = 3, f(x) = 3

therefore, in the interval [2,3), g(x) = 2 - x, which approaches -1 as x approaches 3 from below, but at x = 3, g(x) = 3 - 3 = 0

so, the function g(x) never actually reaches -1, because in each interval, it approaches -1 but doesn't include it, except in the limit.

therefore, the range is all real numbers greater than -1 and up to and including 0.

hence, the range of f(x) - x is \boxed{(-1,0]}

**final answer**
