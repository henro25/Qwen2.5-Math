Answer: Given the values of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) as 1, 2, 3, and 4 in some order, we need to find the largest possible value of the sum \(ab + bc + cd + da\).

first, we recognize that the expression can be rewritten using the identity:
\[
ab + bc + cd + da = (a + c)(b + d)
\]

next, we need to maximize \((a + c)(b + d)\) by considering all possible pairings of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 into two pairs \((a, c)\) and \((b, d)\).

the possible pairings and their sums are:
1. \((1, 2)\) and \((3, 4)\): sums are 3 and 7, product is \(3 \times 7 = 21\)
2. \((1, 3)\) and \((2, 4)\): sums are 4 and 6, product is \(4 \times 6 = 24\)
3. \((1, 4)\) and \((2, 3)\): sums are 5 and 5, product is \(5 \times 5 = 25\)

the maximum product is 25, which occurs when the pairs are \((1, 4)\) and \((2, 3)\).

therefore, the largest possible value of \(ab + bc + cd + da\) is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]
