Reasoning: 
So i have this problem here. it says that a, b, c, and d are the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, but not necessarily in that order. and i need to find the largest possible value of the sum of the four products: ab + bc + cd + da.

alright, first, i need to understand whatâ€™s being asked. i have four variables, each taking one of the values 1, 2, 3, or 4, and i need to assign these values in such a way that when i calculate ab + bc + cd + da, the sum is as large as possible.

let me think about how to approach this. one way is to try all possible permutations of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 for a, b, c, and d, calculate ab + bc + cd + da for each permutation, and then pick the maximum value. but that sounds time-consuming because there are 4! = 24 permutations. maybe there's a smarter way to do this without checking all possibilities.

let me see if i can find a pattern or a formula that can help me maximize this sum.

first, let's write down the expression: ab + bc + cd + da.

i notice that each pair of consecutive variables is multiplied, and also a and d are multiplied at the end. maybe i can factor this expression somehow or find a way to group terms.

alternatively, perhaps i can think in terms of the arrangement of the numbers around a circle, since the variables are cyclic: a to b to c to d and back to a. that might help in visualizing the problem.

wait a minute, maybe i can use the fact that the sum ab + bc + cd + da can be expressed in terms of (a + c)(b + d). let me check that.

expanding (a + c)(b + d), i get ab + ad + bc + cd.

hmm, that's close but not exactly the same as ab + bc + cd + da. there's an extra ad term and missing da term, but da is the same as ad, so actually, ab + bc + cd + da = ab + bc + cd + ad = (a + c)(b + d).

oh, that's interesting! so, ab + bc + cd + da = (a + c)(b + d).

that seems like a useful identity. so, now, i need to maximize (a + c)(b + d), where a, b, c, d are 1, 2, 3, and 4 in some order.

now, this seems simpler. i need to maximize the product of (a + c) and (b + d), given that a, b, c, d are distinct and take the values 1, 2, 3, 4.

let me consider that a + c and b + d are sums of two distinct numbers from 1, 2, 3, 4.

what are the possible sums for two distinct numbers from 1 to 4?

1 + 2 = 3

1 + 3 = 4

1 + 4 = 5

2 + 3 = 5

2 + 4 = 6

3 + 4 = 7

so, the possible sums are 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, and 7.

now, i need to choose two sums from these that use all four numbers, meaning that the pairs (a, c) and (b, d) don't share any numbers.

wait, but in this case, since a, b, c, d are all distinct, the sums (a + c) and (b + d) must be such that all four numbers are used exactly once in the two sums.

but actually, a, b, c, d are distinct, and each is used exactly once in the sums (a + c) and (b + d). so, effectively, i need to partition the set {1, 2, 3, 4} into two pairs, and calculate the product of their sums, then choose the partition that gives the maximum product.

so, let's list all possible pairings:

1. (1, 2) and (3, 4): sums are 3 and 7, product is 3 * 7 = 21

2. (1, 3) and (2, 4): sums are 4 and 6, product is 4 * 6 = 24

3. (1, 4) and (2, 3): sums are 5 and 5, product is 5 * 5 = 25

are there any other pairings? wait, no, that's all, because pairings are unique up to ordering.

so, the possible products are 21, 24, and 25.

therefore, the largest possible value is 25.

so, the answer should be 25.

but wait, let's double-check if there are any other pairings or if i missed something.

we have four numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4.

pairing them into two pairs without overlap:

- (1,2) and (3,4)

- (1,3) and (2,4)

- (1,4) and (2,3)

that's it. no other distinct pairings.

so, the maximum product is indeed 25.

alternatively, to confirm, let's think about maximizing the product of two sums.

we have s1 = a + c and s2 = b + d.

we need to maximize s1 * s2.

given that a + b + c + d = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

so, s1 + s2 = 10.

we need to maximize s1 * s2, given that s1 + s2 = 10.

this is a standard optimization problem: given that s1 + s2 = constant, the product s1 * s2 is maximized when s1 = s2.

that is, when s1 = s2 = 5.

so, the maximum product is 5 * 5 = 25.

this matches what i found earlier.

therefore, the largest possible value of ab + bc + cd + da is 25.

i think that's the answer.

**final answer**

25
