Problem: The Screamers are coached by Coach Yellsalot.  The Screamers have 12 players, but two of them, Bob and Yogi, refuse to play together.  How many starting lineups (of 5 players) can Coach Yellsalot make, if the starting lineup can't contain both Bob and Yogi?  (The order of the 5 players in the lineup does not matter; that is, two lineups are the same if they consist of the same 5 players.)
