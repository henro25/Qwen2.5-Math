Reasoning: So i've got this quadratic expression: -4z² + 20z - 6, and i need to find its maximum value. okay, quadratics, i remember they graph as parabolas. since the coefficient of z² is negative (-4), that means the parabola opens downward, right? so, it should have a maximum point at the vertex.

wait, let me make sure about that. yeah, if the coefficient of z² is negative, the parabola opens downward, and the vertex is the highest point, which would be the maximum value of the function. cool, so i need to find the vertex of this parabola.

i think there are a couple of ways to find the vertex of a quadratic function. one way is to use the formula for the z-coordinate of the vertex, which is -b/(2a), where a is the coefficient of z² and b is the coefficient of z. in this case, a is -4 and b is 20.

so, let's calculate that. z = -b/(2a) = -20/(2*(-4)) = -20/-8 = 2.5. okay, so the z-coordinate of the vertex is 2.5. now, to find the maximum value of the function, i need to plug this value of z back into the original equation.

let me do that. so, plugging z = 2.5 into -4z² + 20z - 6:

first, z² is (2.5)² = 6.25.

then, -4 times 6.25 is -25.

next, 20 times 2.5 is 50.

and then, minus 6.

so, putting it all together: -25 + 50 - 6 = 19.

wait a minute, is that right? let me double-check my calculations.

-4 times 6.25 is indeed -25.

20 times 2.5 is 50.

minus 6.

so, -25 + 50 = 25, and 25 - 6 is 19.

okay, so the maximum value of the function is 19.

alternatively, i could complete the square to find the vertex. maybe i should try that to confirm.

starting with -4z² + 20z - 6.

first, factor out the coefficient of z² from the first two terms: -4(z² - 5z) - 6.

now, to complete the square inside the parentheses, i take half of the coefficient of z, which is -5/2, and square it, getting 25/4.

so, i add and subtract 25/4 inside the parentheses: -4(z² - 5z + 25/4 - 25/4) - 6.

this simplifies to -4[(z - 2.5)² - 25/4] - 6.

distribute the -4: -4(z - 2.5)² + 25 - 6.

which is -4(z - 2.5)² + 19.

so, the function is now in vertex form: f(z) = -4(z - 2.5)² + 19.

from this form, it's clear that the vertex is at (2.5, 19), and since the coefficient of the squared term is negative, this is indeed the maximum point.

therefore, the maximum value of the function is 19.

just to be thorough, i could also take the derivative if i wanted to use calculus, but since this is a quadratic, it's probably unnecessary. but for practice, let's see.

the derivative of f(z) = -4z² + 20z - 6 is f'(z) = -8z + 20.

setting the derivative equal to zero to find critical points: -8z + 20 = 0 => 8z = 20 => z = 20/8 = 2.5.

so, again, z = 2.5 is the point where the function has a maximum (since the second derivative is f''(z) = -8, which is negative, confirming a maximum).

plugging z = 2.5 back into the original function: -4*(2.5)^2 + 20*(2.5) - 6 = -4*6.25 + 50 - 6 = -25 + 50 - 6 = 19.

consistently getting 19 as the maximum value, so i'm confident that's the correct answer.
