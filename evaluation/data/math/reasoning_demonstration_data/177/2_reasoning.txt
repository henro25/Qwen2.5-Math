Reasoning: So i have this problem here: in right triangle bcd with angle d being 90 degrees, bc is 9 and bd is 4. i need to find sin b. alright, let's see.

first, i need to visualize the triangle. since angle d is 90 degrees, that means bd and dc are the legs of the right triangle, and bc is the hypotenuse. wait, no—actually, in a right triangle, the side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse. so, in triangle bcd with angle d being 90 degrees, the hypotenuse should be bc, and the legs are bd and cd.

so, bd is one leg, cd is the other leg, and bc is the hypotenuse. given that bd is 4 and bc is 9, i need to find sin b.

i recall that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. so, sin b = opposite side over hypotenuse.

in this case, angle b is at vertex b, so the side opposite to angle b is cd, and the hypotenuse is always the side opposite the right angle, which is bc.

so, sin b = cd / bc.

but wait, i don't know the length of cd yet. i only know bd and bc. maybe i can find cd using the pythagorean theorem.

in a right triangle, the pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. so, bc² = bd² + cd².

i can plug in the known values:

9² = 4² + cd²

81 = 16 + cd²

subtracting 16 from both sides:

81 - 16 = cd²

65 = cd²

so, cd = sqrt(65)

now, sin b = cd / bc = sqrt(65) / 9

but the problem might expect a simplified form or maybe rationalized denominator, but sqrt(65) doesn't simplify further since 65 is 5 times 13, both primes.

alternatively, maybe i can express sin b in terms of the sides i know.

wait a minute, perhaps there's another approach. maybe using the definition of sine in terms of adjacent and opposite sides.

actually, no, in the right triangle, sine is opposite over hypotenuse, which i already used.

let me double-check the pythagorean theorem step to make sure i didn't make a mistake there.

bc² = bd² + cd²

81 = 16 + cd²

cd² = 81 - 16 = 65

cd = sqrt(65)

that seems correct.

so, sin b = cd / bc = sqrt(65) / 9

is there a way to rationalize the denominator?

well, sqrt(65) is already simplified, and 65 has no perfect square factors besides 1, so i think that's as simplified as it gets.

alternatively, maybe expressing it in decimal form, but the problem likely expects an exact value.

so, sin b = sqrt(65) / 9

but let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using trigonometric identities or something else.

alternatively, perhaps i can find angle b using inverse sine or cosine and then find sin b, but that seems unnecessary since i already have the sides needed.

wait, maybe i can use the definition of cosine for angle b and then relate it to sine, but again, that seems like extra work.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the fact that in a right triangle, the sine of one acute angle is equal to the cosine of the other acute angle, but that doesn't seem helpful here.

i think my initial approach is correct.

let me verify with another method.

suppose i consider the definition of sine as the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse.

opposite side to angle b is cd, which i found to be sqrt(65), and the hypotenuse is bc, which is 9.

so, sin b = sqrt(65) / 9

alternatively, maybe i can find angle b using the tangent function and then find its sine, but that seems more complicated.

tangent of angle b would be opposite over adjacent, which is cd / bd = sqrt(65) / 4

then, angle b = arctan(sqrt(65)/4), and sin b would be sin(arctan(sqrt(65)/4)), but that seems unnecessarily complicated for this problem.

i think sticking with the initial answer is best.

so, sin b = sqrt(65) / 9

to confirm, perhaps i can check if this makes sense dimensionally and logically.

since bd is 4 and bc is 9, cd being sqrt(65) is reasonable because sqrt(65) is approximately 8.06, which is less than 9, so it fits as the other leg of the triangle.

also, sin b should be less than 1, and sqrt(65)/9 is approximately 8.06/9, which is less than 1, so that checks out.

therefore, i'm confident that sin b = sqrt(65) / 9

**final answer**

65
