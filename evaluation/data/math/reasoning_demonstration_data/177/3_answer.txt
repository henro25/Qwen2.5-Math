Answer: In right triangle \(bcd\) with \(\angle d = 90^\circ\), we have \(bc = 9\) and \(bd = 4\). we need to find \(\sin b\).

first, we use the pythagorean theorem to find \(cd\):

\[
bc^2 = bd^2 + cd^2
\]

\[
9^2 = 4^2 + cd^2
\]

\[
81 = 16 + cd^2
\]

\[
cd^2 = 81 - 16 = 65
\]

\[
cd = \sqrt{65}
\]

next, we use the definition of sine for angle \(b\):

\[
\sin b = \frac{\text{opposite side}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{cd}{bc} = \frac{\sqrt{65}}{9}
\]

therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{65}}{9}}
\]
