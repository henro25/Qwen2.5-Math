Reasoning: So i've got this probability problem here: alli rolls a standard 6-sided die twice. what's the probability that the two numbers she rolls differ by 2? and i need to express the answer as a common fraction.

okay, first things first, i need to understand what's being asked. we're dealing with two rolls of a die, and we want the difference between the two numbers to be exactly 2. since it's a standard die, each face has numbers from 1 to 6, and each roll is independent of the other.

so, the possible outcomes for each roll are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. when rolling the die twice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 times 6, which is 36. that makes sense because for each of the 6 outcomes of the first roll, there are 6 possible outcomes for the second roll.

now, i need to find out how many of these 36 possible outcomes have numbers that differ by exactly 2. let's think about this.

one way to approach this is to list all the possible pairs where the difference is 2 and then count them. let's see:

- if the first roll is 1, what can the second roll be? well, 1 plus 2 is 3, so if the second roll is 3, the difference is 2. alternatively, if the second roll is 1 minus 2, that's -1, but since we're dealing with positive numbers on the die, that's not possible. so only one possible outcome here: (1,3).

- if the first roll is 2, then the second roll can be 2 plus 2, which is 4, or 2 minus 2, which is 0. but 0 isn't on the die, so only (2,4).

- if the first roll is 3, second roll can be 3 plus 2 = 5, or 3 minus 2 = 1. both 1 and 5 are on the die, so (3,1) and (3,5).

- if the first roll is 4, second roll can be 4 plus 2 = 6, or 4 minus 2 = 2. both are valid, so (4,2) and (4,6).

- if the first roll is 5, second roll can be 5 plus 2 = 7, which is not on the die, or 5 minus 2 = 3. so only (5,3).

- if the first roll is 6, second roll can be 6 plus 2 = 8, which is not on the die, or 6 minus 2 = 4. so only (6,4).

okay, so listing all these out:

(1,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,5), (4,2), (4,6), (5,3), (6,4).

that's a total of 8 favorable outcomes.

now, since there are 36 possible outcomes in total, the probability should be the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

so, probability = 8 / 36.

this can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 4: 8 ÷ 4 = 2, and 36 ÷ 4 = 9. so, 2/9.

wait, but i should double-check if i missed any possible pairs.

let me think differently. instead of fixing the first roll and finding the second, maybe i can consider the pairs where the absolute difference is 2.

that is, |a - b| = 2, where a and b are the results of the two rolls.

so, a - b = 2 or b - a = 2.

let's list all such pairs:

a=1, b=3 (since 3-1=2)

a=2, b=4 (4-2=2)

a=3, b=1 (3-1=2, but wait, 1-3=-2, so absolute difference is 2)

a=3, b=5 (5-3=2)

a=4, b=2 (4-2=2)

a=4, b=6 (6-4=2)

a=5, b=3 (5-3=2)

a=6, b=4 (6-4=2)

again, that's 8 pairs. so, i think that's correct.

alternatively, i could think about it in terms of ordered pairs.

each pair (a,b) is distinct from (b,a), unless a=b, but in this case, a and b differ by 2, so a ≠ b.

so, there are no repeated pairs here.

alternatively, another way to think about it is to fix the difference and count.

for difference of 2:

the smaller number can be from 1 to 4, because 4 + 2 = 6, which is the maximum on the die.

so, smaller number can be 1,2,3,4.

for each of these, the larger number is the smaller plus 2.

so, for smaller=1, larger=3

smaller=2, larger=4

smaller=3, larger=5

smaller=4, larger=6

now, since the rolls are ordered (first and second), each of these gives two possible ordered pairs:

(1,3) and (3,1)

(2,4) and (4,2)

(3,5) and (5,3)

(4,6) and (6,4)

that's 8 ordered pairs again.

so, all methods point to 8 favorable outcomes out of 36 total possible outcomes.

therefore, the probability is 8/36, which simplifies to 2/9.

so, the final answer should be \boxed{\dfrac{2}{9}}

**final answer**
