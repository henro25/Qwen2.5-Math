Answer: Alli rolls a standard 6-sided die twice. we need to find the probability that the two numbers rolled differ by 2.

first, we calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling a die twice, which is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

next, we identify the pairs of numbers that differ by 2. these pairs are:
- (1, 3)
- (2, 4)
- (3, 1)
- (3, 5)
- (4, 2)
- (4, 6)
- (5, 3)
- (6, 4)

there are 8 such pairs.

the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:
\[
\text{probability} = \frac{8}{36} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

thus, the final answer is \boxed{\frac{2}{9}}.
