Answer: To find the smallest positive integer \( n \) with six positive odd integer divisors and twelve positive even integer divisors, we start by expressing \( n \) as \( n = 2^k \times m \), where \( m \) is an odd integer and \( k \) is a positive integer.

given:
- number of odd divisors of \( n \) is 6.
- number of even divisors of \( n \) is 12.

the total number of divisors of \( n \) is:
\[ d(n) = 6 + 12 = 18 \]

since \( n = 2^k \times m \), the total number of divisors is:
\[ (k+1) \times d(m) = 18 \]
given \( d(m) = 6 \):
\[ (k+1) \times 6 = 18 \]
\[ k+1 = 3 \]
\[ k = 2 \]

thus, \( n = 2^2 \times m = 4 \times m \), where \( m \) is an odd integer with 6 divisors.

to find the smallest \( m \) with 6 divisors, we consider the factorization:
\[ (a_1+1)(a_2+1)\dots(a_r+1) = 6 \]

possible factorizations:
1. \( 6 = 6 \times 1 \) corresponding to \( m = p^5 \)
2. \( 6 = 3 \times 2 \) corresponding to \( m = p^2 \times q \)

choosing the smallest primes:
- for \( m = p^5 \), \( m = 3^5 = 243 \)
- for \( m = p^2 \times q \), \( m = 3^2 \times 5 = 45 \)

the smallest \( m \) is 45. therefore:
\[ n = 4 \times 45 = 180 \]

verification:
- prime factorization of 180: \( 180 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5 \)
- total divisors: \( (2+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 3 \times 3 \times 2 = 18 \)
- odd divisors: \( (2+1)(1+1) = 3 \times 2 = 6 \)
- even divisors: \( 18 - 6 = 12 \)

thus, the smallest positive integer with six positive odd integer divisors and twelve positive even integer divisors is:
\[
\boxed{180}
\]
