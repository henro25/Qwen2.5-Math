Reasoning: So i have this problem here: "what is the smallest positive integer with six positive odd integer divisors and twelve positive even integer divisors?" hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but i think i can figure it out by breaking it down.

first off, i need to understand what it means for a number to have odd and even divisors. well, any even number is divisible by 2, and any odd number isn't. so, if a number is even, it will have both even and odd divisors, while an odd number will only have odd divisors.

the problem is asking for the smallest positive integer that has exactly six positive odd divisors and twelve positive even divisors. let's denote this number by 
n
n.

since 
n
n has even divisors, it must be even itself. that means 
n
n is divisible by 2. so, i can write 
n
n as 
n
=
2
k
×
m
n=2 
k
 ×m, where 
m
m is an odd integer (since all the factors of 2 are separated out), and 
k
k is a positive integer.

now, the total number of divisors of 
n
n can be found using the formula for the number of divisors based on prime factorization. if 
n
=
2
k
×
m
n=2 
k
 ×m, and 
m
m has its own prime factors, say 
m
=
p
1
a
1
×
p
2
a
2
×
⋯
×
p
r

m=p

1
​
 
​
 ×p 
2
a 
2
​
 
​
 ×⋯×p 
r
a 
r
​
 
​
 , then the total number of divisors of 
n
n is 
(
k
+
1
)
(
a
1
+
1
)
(
a
2
+
1
)
…
(
a
r
+
1
)
(k+1)(a 
1
​
 +1)(a 
2
​
 +1)…(a 
r
​
 +1).

but in this problem, we're specifically interested in the number of odd and even divisors.

the number of even divisors is equal to the total number of divisors minus the number of odd divisors. so, if 
d
(
n
)
d(n) is the total number of divisors of 
n
n, then the number of even divisors is 
d
(
n
)
−
d
(
m
)
d(n)−d(m), where 
d
(
m
)
d(m) is the number of divisors of 
m
m.

according to the problem, 
d
(
m
)
=
6
d(m)=6 (the number of odd divisors), and the number of even divisors is 
12
12. so, we have:

d
(
n
)
−
d
(
m
)
=
12
d(n)−d(m)=12
d
(
n
)
−
6
=
12
d(n)−6=12
d
(
n
)
=
18
d(n)=18
so, the total number of divisors of 
n
n is 18.

now, since 
n
=
2
k
×
m
n=2 
k
 ×m, and 
m
m is odd, the number of divisors of 
n
n is 
(
k
+
1
)
×
d
(
m
)
=
(
k
+
1
)
×
6
=
18
(k+1)×d(m)=(k+1)×6=18. therefore:

(
k
+
1
)
×
6
=
18
(k+1)×6=18
k
+
1
=
3
k+1=3
k
=
2
k=2
so, the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of 
n
n is 2. that means 
n
=
2
2
×
m
=
4
×
m
n=2 
2
 ×m=4×m, where 
m
m is an odd integer with 6 divisors.

now, i need to find the smallest odd integer 
m
m that has exactly 6 positive divisors.

first, let's recall that the number of divisors of a number is determined by its prime factorization. if 
m
=
p
1
a
1
×
p
2
a
2
×
⋯
×
p
r
a
r
m=p 
1
a 
1
​
 
​
 ×p 
2
a 
2
​
 
​
 ×⋯×p 
r
a 
r
​
 
​
 , then the number of divisors is 
(
a
1
+
1
)
(
a
2
+
1
)
…
(
a
r
+
1
)
(a 
1
​
 +1)(a 
2
​
 +1)…(a 
r
​
 +1).

we need 
(
a
1
+
1
)
(
a
2
+
1
)
…
(
a
r
+
1
)
=
6
(a 
1
​
 +1)(a 
2
​
 +1)…(a 
r
​
 +1)=6.

now, 6 can be factored in a few ways:

1. 
6
=
6
×
1
6=6×1, which would correspond to 
m
=
p
5
m=p 
5
 , where 
p
p is an odd prime.

2. 
6
=
3
×
2
6=3×2, which would correspond to 
m
=
p
2
×
q
m=p 
2
 ×q, where 
p
p and 
q
q are distinct odd primes.

3. 
6
=
2
×
3
6=2×3, similar to above, just the order changes, but since multiplication is commutative, it's the same as the previous case.

4. 
6
=
1
×
6
6=1×6, similar to the first case.

now, i need to find the smallest 
m
m, so i should choose the smallest possible primes for 
p
p and 
q
q.

option 1: 
m
=
p
5
m=p 
5
 . the smallest odd prime is 3, so 
m
=
3
5
=
243
m=3 
5
 =243.

option 2: 
m
=
p
2
×
q
m=p 
2
 ×q. the smallest odd primes are 3 and 5, so 
m
=
3
2
×
5
=
9
×
5
=
45
m=3 
2
 ×5=9×5=45.

comparing 243 and 45, clearly 45 is smaller. so, 
m
=
45
m=45 seems to be the better choice.

but wait, is there a smaller 
m
m that satisfies the conditions? let's check if there are any smaller odd integers with exactly 6 divisors.

let's list the number of divisors for some small odd integers:

- 1: 1 divisor (not 6)

- 3: 1, 3 → 2 divisors

- 5: 1, 5 → 2 divisors

- 7: 1, 7 → 2 divisors

- 9: 1, 3, 9 → 3 divisors

- 15: 1, 3, 5, 15 → 4 divisors

- 21: 1, 3, 7, 21 → 4 divisors

- 25: 1, 5, 25 → 3 divisors

- 27: 1, 3, 9, 27 → 4 divisors

- 33: 1, 3, 11, 33 → 4 divisors

- 35: 1, 5, 7, 35 → 4 divisors

- 39: 1, 3, 13, 39 → 4 divisors

- 45: 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45 → 6 divisors

so, indeed, 45 is the smallest odd integer with exactly 6 divisors.

therefore, 
m
=
45
m=45, and since 
n
=
4
×
m
=
4
×
45
=
180
n=4×m=4×45=180, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given conditions is 180.

but wait, let me double-check if there's a smaller 
n
n that meets the criteria. maybe there's a different combination of exponents or primes that could yield a smaller 
n
n.

let's consider if 
m
m could be smaller than 45 with 6 divisors. from the list above, it seems 45 is indeed the smallest odd integer with exactly 6 divisors.

also, since 
k
=
2
k=2 is fixed from earlier, the smallest 
n
n is 
4
×
45
=
180
4×45=180.

to confirm, let's check the number of odd and even divisors of 180.

first, find the prime factorization of 180:

180
=
2
2
×
3
2
×
5
1
180=2 
2
 ×3 
2
 ×5 
1
 

the total number of divisors is 
(
2
+
1
)
(
2
+
1
)
(
1
+
1
)
=
3
×
3
×
2
=
18
(2+1)(2+1)(1+1)=3×3×2=18, which matches our earlier finding.

the number of odd divisors is determined by the factors of 
m
=
3
2
×
5
1
m=3 
2
 ×5 
1
 , which is 
(
2
+
1
)
(
1
+
1
)
=
3
×
2
=
6
(2+1)(1+1)=3×2=6, as required.

the number of even divisors is 
18
−
6
=
12
18−6=12, which also matches.

so, 180 satisfies all the given conditions.

is there any way to make 
n
n smaller? well, if 
m
m can't be smaller than 45 with exactly 6 divisors, and 
k
=
2
k=2 is necessary to get the required number of even divisors, then 180 should indeed be the smallest such number.

therefore, the smallest positive integer with six positive odd integer divisors and twelve positive even integer divisors is 180.

**final answer**

180
180
