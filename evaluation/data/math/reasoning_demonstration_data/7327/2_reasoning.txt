Reasoning: Alright, so I've got this problem here: "The longest side of a right triangle is 5 meters and the shortest side is 3 meters. What is the area of the triangle in square meters?" Okay, let's see. I know that in a right triangle, the sides are related by the Pythagorean theorem, which is a² + b² = c², where c is the hypotenuse, the longest side.

So, the problem says the longest side is 5 meters. That must be the hypotenuse, right? And the shortest side is 3 meters. So, the sides are 3 meters and 5 meters, and I need to find the area.

Wait, in a right triangle, the area is (base * height)/2. But which sides are the base and height here? Well, in a right triangle, the two legs are perpendicular to each other, so they can be considered the base and height.

But hold on, the problem says the longest side is 5 meters, which is the hypotenuse, and the shortest side is 3 meters, which is one of the legs. So, I need to find the other leg to use in the area formula.

Let me try to find the other leg using the Pythagorean theorem. If c is 5 and one leg is 3, then the other leg, let's call it b, should satisfy 3² + b² = 5².

So, 9 + b² = 25. Subtracting 9 from both sides, b² = 16. Taking the square root of both sides, b = 4 meters.

Now that I have both legs, 3 meters and 4 meters, I can find the area. Area = (base * height)/2 = (3 * 4)/2 = 12/2 = 6 square meters.

Wait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe double-checking the Pythagorean theorem application.

Yes, 3² is 9, 4² is 16, and 9 + 16 is 25, which is 5². So, that checks out.

Alternatively, I could have used the formula for the area of a right triangle, which is (leg1 * leg2)/2, which is exactly what I did.

I think that's it. The area should be 6 square meters.
