Reasoning: So i have this problem here: the height of a ball when it's thrown off a cliff is given by the equation h = 45 - 7t - 6t², where t is time in seconds. i need to find out in how many seconds the ball will reach a height of 25 feet.

first, i should understand what the equation is telling me. the height h is a function of time t, and it's a quadratic equation because of the t² term. quadratic equations usually graph as parabolas, and in this case, since the coefficient of t² is negative (-6), the parabola opens downward. that makes sense because the ball is being thrown off a cliff, so it will go up for a bit and then come back down.

i need to find the time t when the height h is 25 feet. so, i should set h equal to 25 and solve for t.

so, starting with the equation:

h = 45 - 7t - 6t²

set h to 25:

25 = 45 - 7t - 6t²

now, i need to solve this equation for t. it's a quadratic equation, so i can rearrange it to the standard form, which is ax² + bx + c = 0.

let's move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:

45 - 7t - 6t² - 25 = 0

simplify the constants:

45 - 25 = 20, so:

20 - 7t - 6t² = 0

to make it easier, i can rearrange the terms in descending order of t:

-6t² - 7t + 20 = 0

quadratic equations are usually written with the positive coefficient for t², so i can multiply the entire equation by -1 to make it positive:

6t² + 7t - 20 = 0

now, i have the quadratic equation in standard form:

6t² + 7t - 20 = 0

to solve for t, i can use the quadratic formula:

t = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

where a = 6, b = 7, and c = -20.

first, calculate the discriminant, which is b² - 4ac:

b² = 7² = 49

4ac = 4 * 6 * (-20) = 4 * 6 * (-20) = 24 * (-20) = -480

so, discriminant = 49 - (-480) = 49 + 480 = 529

now, take the square root of the discriminant:

√529 = 23

now, plug the values back into the quadratic formula:

t = [-7 ± 23] / (2 * 6) = [-7 ± 23] / 12

so, there are two possible solutions:

t = (-7 + 23) / 12 = 16 / 12 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 seconds

and

t = (-7 - 23) / 12 = (-30) / 12 = -2.5 seconds

wait a minute, time can't be negative in this context. so, t = -2.5 seconds doesn't make sense physically because time cannot be negative when measuring from the moment the ball is thrown.

therefore, the only valid solution is t = 4/3 seconds, which is approximately 1.333 seconds.

but let me double-check my calculations to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

starting again:

original equation: h = 45 - 7t - 6t²

set h = 25:

25 = 45 - 7t - 6t²

subtract 25 from both sides:

0 = 20 - 7t - 6t²

rearrange:

-6t² -7t + 20 = 0

multiply by -1:

6t² + 7t - 20 = 0

quadratic formula: t = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

a = 6, b = 7, c = -20

discriminant: b² - 4ac = 49 - 4*(6)*(-20) = 49 + 480 = 529

√529 = 23

so, t = [-7 ± 23]/12

t = (-7 + 23)/12 = 16/12 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 seconds

t = (-7 - 23)/12 = -30/12 = -2.5 seconds (discarded)

so, yes, t = 4/3 seconds is the correct answer.

wait, but maybe there's another way to look at this. maybe i can factor the quadratic equation instead of using the quadratic formula.

let's try factoring 6t² + 7t - 20 = 0

looking for two numbers that multiply to (6 * -20) = -120 and add up to 7.

what two numbers multiply to -120 and add to 7?

let's see:

15 and -8: 15 * (-8) = -120, and 15 + (-8) = 7. perfect.

so, i can split the middle term using these numbers:

6t² + 15t - 8t - 20 = 0

now, group the terms:

(6t² + 15t) + (-8t - 20) = 0

factor out the common factors in each group:

3t(2t + 5) - 4(2t + 5) = 0

now, factor out the common binomial factor (2t + 5):

(2t + 5)(3t - 4) = 0

set each factor equal to zero:

2t + 5 = 0 => t = -5/2 = -2.5 seconds (discarded)

3t - 4 = 0 => t = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 seconds

again, i get t = 4/3 seconds as the valid solution.

this confirms my earlier result using the quadratic formula.

so, the ball reaches a height of 25 feet at t = 4/3 seconds, or approximately 1.333 seconds after being thrown.

i should probably check if this makes sense in the context of the problem.

given the original equation h = 45 - 7t - 6t², plugging t = 4/3 into this should give h = 25.

let's verify:

h = 45 - 7*(4/3) - 6*(4/3)²

first, calculate each term:

7*(4/3) = 28/3 ≈ 9.333

(4/3)² = 16/9

6*(16/9) = 96/9 = 32/3 ≈ 10.666

now, plug these back into the equation:

h = 45 - (28/3) - (32/3)

convert 45 to thirds: 45 = 135/3

so, h = 135/3 - 28/3 - 32/3 = (135 - 28 - 32)/3 = (135 - 60)/3 = 75/3 = 25

yes, it checks out.

therefore, the time is indeed 4/3 seconds.

i think that's the answer.
