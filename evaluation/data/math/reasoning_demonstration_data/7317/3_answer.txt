Answer: To find the time \( t \) when the ball reaches a height of 25 feet, we start with the given height equation:

\[ h = 45 - 7t - 6t^2 \]

set \( h = 25 \):

\[ 25 = 45 - 7t - 6t^2 \]

rearrange to standard quadratic form:

\[ 0 = 20 - 7t - 6t^2 \]
\[ 6t^2 + 7t - 20 = 0 \]

using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) with \( a = 6 \), \( b = 7 \), and \( c = -20 \):

\[ t = \frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 480}}{12} \]
\[ t = \frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{529}}{12} \]
\[ t = \frac{-7 \pm 23}{12} \]

this gives two solutions:

\[ t = \frac{16}{12} = \frac{4}{3} \]
\[ t = \frac{-30}{12} = -2.5 \]

since time cannot be negative, the valid solution is:

\[ t = \frac{4}{3} \]

thus, the ball reaches a height of 25 feet in:

\[
\boxed{\frac{4}{3} \text{ seconds}}
\]
