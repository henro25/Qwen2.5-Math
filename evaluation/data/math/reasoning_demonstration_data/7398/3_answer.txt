Answer: Coach Grunt is preparing a 5-person starting lineup from a team of 12 players, with Ace and Zeppo guaranteed spots. This means 3 more players need to be selected from the remaining 10 players. Since the order of the players doesn't matter, this is a combination problem.

The number of ways to choose 3 players from 10 is given by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{10}{3} = \frac{10!}{3!(10-3)!} = \frac{10!}{3! \cdot 7!}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\binom{10}{3} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 120
\]

Thus, there are **120** different starting lineups possible.
