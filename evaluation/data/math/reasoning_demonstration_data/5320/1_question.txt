Problem: A section is cut out of a circular piece of paper having radius four inches, as shown. Points A and B are then glued together to form a right circular cone. What is the circumference of the base of the resulting cone? Express your answer in terms of $\pi$.  (The $270^\circ$ sector forms the cone.)
