Reasoning: So i've got this problem here. there are two arithmetic sequences, a and b, both starting with 30. they have common differences of absolute value 10, but sequence a is increasing and sequence b is decreasing. i need to find the absolute value of the difference between the 51st term of sequence a and the 51st term of sequence b.

first, i need to recall what an arithmetic sequence is. an arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where the difference between consecutive terms is constant. this constant difference is called the common difference.

for sequence a, since it's increasing and has a common difference of absolute value 10, that means the common difference is +10.

for sequence b, since it's decreasing and has a common difference of absolute value 10, that means the common difference is -10.

now, both sequences start with 30.

let me write down the general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence.

the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d

where:

- a_n is the nth term

- a_1 is the first term

- d is the common difference

- n is the term number

so, for sequence a:

a_n = 30 + (n - 1)*10

and for sequence b:

b_n = 30 + (n - 1)*(-10) = 30 - 10(n - 1)

i need to find the 51st term of each sequence.

first, let's find the 51st term of sequence a:

a_51 = 30 + (51 - 1)*10 = 30 + 50*10 = 30 + 500 = 530

now, the 51st term of sequence b:

b_51 = 30 - 10*(51 - 1) = 30 - 10*50 = 30 - 500 = -470

now, i need the absolute value of the difference between these two terms.

so, |a_51 - b_51| = |530 - (-470)| = |530 + 470| = |1000| = 1000

wait, that seems straightforward. but let me double-check my calculations to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

first, sequence a:

a_n = 30 + (n - 1)*10

for n=51:

a_51 = 30 + 50*10 = 30 + 500 = 530

that seems correct.

sequence b:

b_n = 30 - 10*(n - 1)

for n=51:

b_51 = 30 - 10*50 = 30 - 500 = -470

that also looks correct.

difference:

530 - (-470) = 530 + 470 = 1000

absolute value is 1000.

is there another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer?

let me think about the general difference between the nth terms of the two sequences.

a_n = 30 + (n - 1)*10

b_n = 30 - 10*(n - 1)

so, the difference a_n - b_n = [30 + 10(n - 1)] - [30 - 10(n - 1)] = 30 + 10n - 10 - 30 + 10n - 10 = wait, that doesn't look right.

let me recalculate that:

a_n - b_n = [30 + 10(n - 1)] - [30 - 10(n - 1)] = 30 + 10n - 10 - 30 + 10n - (-10) ?

wait, no, better to distribute the negative sign properly.

a_n - b_n = 30 + 10(n - 1) - 30 + 10(n - 1)

wait, no.

wait, b_n is 30 - 10(n - 1), so when subtracting b_n, it's minus (30 - 10(n - 1)) which is -30 + 10(n - 1).

so, a_n - b_n = [30 + 10(n - 1)] - [30 - 10(n - 1)] = 30 + 10n - 10 - 30 + 10n - (-10)? wait, that's confusing.

let me do it step by step.

a_n = 30 + 10(n - 1)

b_n = 30 - 10(n - 1)

so, a_n - b_n = [30 + 10(n - 1)] - [30 - 10(n - 1)] = 30 + 10n - 10 - 30 + 10n - (-10)?

wait, no. actually, it's:

a_n - b_n = (30 + 10(n - 1)) - (30 - 10(n - 1)) = 30 + 10n - 10 - 30 + 10n - (-10)?

wait, that can't be right. let me carefully distribute the subtraction.

= 30 + 10(n - 1) - 30 + 10(n - 1)

wait, no.

wait, no. it's (30 + 10(n - 1)) - (30 - 10(n - 1)) = 30 + 10(n - 1) - 30 + 10(n - 1)

because subtracting a negative is adding.

so, it's 30 + 10(n - 1) - 30 + 10(n - 1) = [30 - 30] + [10(n - 1) + 10(n - 1)] = 0 + 20(n - 1) = 20(n - 1)

therefore, a_n - b_n = 20(n - 1)

so, for n=51, the difference is 20*(51 - 1) = 20*50 = 1000

and the absolute value is 1000.

this matches my earlier calculation.

alternatively, i can think about the sequences.

sequence a is increasing by 10 each time, starting at 30.

sequence b is decreasing by 10 each time, starting at 30.

so, for each term beyond the first, sequence a is moving away from sequence b by 20 per term.

wait, let me think about that.

wait, for each term, sequence a increases by 10, and sequence b decreases by 10, so the difference between corresponding terms increases by 20 each time.

wait, but actually, since one is increasing by 10 and the other is decreasing by 10, the difference between them increases by 20 each term.

wait, is that correct?

let's see.

first term: both are 30, so difference is 0.

second term: a is 40, b is 20, difference is 20.

third term: a is 50, b is 10, difference is 40.

fourth term: a is 60, b is 0, difference is 60.

wait, no, sequence b starts at 30 and decreases by 10 each time.

so, first term: 30

second term: 30 - 10 = 20

third term: 20 - 10 = 10

fourth term: 10 - 10 = 0

and sequence a:

first term: 30

second term: 30 + 10 = 40

third term: 40 + 10 = 50

fourth term: 50 + 10 = 60

so, differences:

term 1: 30 - 30 = 0

term 2: 40 - 20 = 20

term 3: 50 - 10 = 40

term 4: 60 - 0 = 60

so, the difference increases by 20 each time.

so, the difference between the nth terms is 20*(n - 1)

which matches what i found earlier.

therefore, for n=51, difference is 20*(51-1) = 20*50 = 1000

absolute value is 1000.

alternatively, i can think about the sequences converging or diverging.

but in this case, since one is increasing and the other is decreasing with the same rate, they are moving away from each other at a constant rate per term.

wait, no, actually, the difference increases by 20 per term, as seen in the earlier example.

so, for the first term, difference is 0.

second term, difference is 20.

third term, difference is 40.

and so on, up to the 51st term, difference is 20*(51 - 1) = 1000.

therefore, the absolute value of the difference is 1000.

i think that's the answer.
