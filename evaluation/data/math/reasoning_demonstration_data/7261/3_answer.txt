Answer: To calculate $(243)^{\frac{3}{5}}$, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the expression**: The expression $(243)^{\frac{3}{5}}$ means taking the fifth root of 243 and then raising the result to the third power.

2. **Simplify the base**: Recognize that 243 is a power of 3:
   \[
   243 = 3^5
   \]

3. **Apply exponent rules**: Use the rule $(a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}$:
   \[
   (3^5)^{\frac{3}{5}} = 3^{5 \cdot \frac{3}{5}} = 3^3
   \]

4. **Calculate the final exponentiation**:
   \[
   3^3 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27
   \]

**Answer**: $(243)^{\frac{3}{5}} = 27$
