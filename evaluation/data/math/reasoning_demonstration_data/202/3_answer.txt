Answer: First, we determine the fourth vertex of the rectangle. given vertices are \((5, 11)\), \((16, 11)\), and \((16, -2)\). the fourth vertex is \((5, -2)\), forming a rectangle with vertices at \((5, 11)\), \((16, 11)\), \((16, -2)\), and \((5, -2)\).

next, we analyze the circle given by the equation \((x - 5)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 9\). this circle is centered at \((5, -2)\) with a radius of 3.

the intersection of the circle and the rectangle is the part of the circle that lies within the bounds of the rectangle. the circle's horizontal range is from \(x = 2\) to \(x = 8\) and vertical range from \(y = -5\) to \(y = 1\). the rectangle's bounds are \(x = 5\) to \(x = 16\) and \(y = -2\) to \(y = 11\).

the overlapping region is the part of the circle where \(x \geq 5\) and \(y \geq -2\), which forms a quarter-circle.

the area of the full circle is:
\[
\pi r^2 = \pi \times 3^2 = 9\pi
\]

the area of the quarter-circle is:
\[
\frac{9\pi}{4}
\]

thus, the area of the intersection is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{9\pi}{4}}
\]
