Reasoning: So i've got this geometry problem here. it says that three of the four vertices of a rectangle are given: (5,11), (16,11), and (16,-2). i need to find the area of the intersection between this rectangle and the region inside the circle defined by the equation 
(
x
−

)
2
+
(
y

2
)
2
=
9
(x−5) 
2
 +(y+2) 
2
 =9. and i have to express the answer in terms of 
π
π.

first, i need to figure out what the fourth vertex of the rectangle is. since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and parallel. looking at the points given: (5,11), (16,11), and (16,-2).

i can see that (5,11) and (16,11) share the same y-coordinate, which means they lie on a horizontal line. similarly, (16,11) and (16,-2) share the same x-coordinate, so they lie on a vertical line.

so, the rectangle has sides parallel to the axes. to find the fourth vertex, i need to take the x-coordinate from (5,11) and the y-coordinate from (16,-2), which should give me (5,-2). let me confirm that.

yes, that makes sense because the opposite sides should be equal. so the rectangle has vertices at (5,11), (16,11), (16,-2), and (5,-2).

next, i need to understand the circle. the equation of the circle is 
(
x
−
5
)
2
+
(
y
+
2
)
2
=
9
(x−5) 
2
 +(y+2) 
2
 =9. this is in the standard form of a circle's equation, 
(
x
−
h
)
2
+
(
y
−
k
)
2
=
r
2
(x−h) 
2
 +(y−k) 
2
 =r 
2
 , where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius.

so, the center of the circle is at (5, -2), and the radius is 
9
=
3
9
​
 =3.

interesting, one of the rectangle's vertices is at (5,-2), which is exactly the center of the circle. so, the circle is centered at one corner of the rectangle.

now, i need to find the area of the intersection between the rectangle and the circle. since the circle is centered at (5,-2) with a radius of 3, and the rectangle extends from x=5 to x=16 and from y=-2 to y=11, i need to see how much of the circle lies within these bounds.

first, let's visualize this. the circle is centered at (5,-2) with radius 3, so it extends from x=5-3=2 to x=5+3=8, and from y=-2-3=-5 to y=-2+3=1.

but the rectangle extends from x=5 to x=16 and y=-2 to y=11. so, the circle's horizontal range is from x=2 to x=8, but the rectangle starts at x=5, so the part of the circle that overlaps with the rectangle in the x-direction is from x=5 to x=8.

in the y-direction, the circle goes from y=-5 to y=1, but the rectangle starts at y=-2, so the overlapping y-range is from y=-2 to y=1.

so, the intersection region is the part of the circle that lies within x=5 to x=8 and y=-2 to y=1.

i need to find the area of this intersection.

one way to approach this is to find the area of the circle that lies within the rectangle. since the circle is centered at (5,-2), and the rectangle extends rightwards and upwards from that point, i can think of this as finding the area of a quarter-circle or some segment of the circle.

wait, actually, since the circle extends to x=8 and the rectangle starts at x=5, and the circle extends to y=1 and the rectangle starts at y=-2, i need to find the area of the circle that is to the right of x=5 and above y=-2.

let me sketch this out mentally.

the circle is centered at (5,-2), radius 3. the rectangle starts at (5,-2), extends to the right up to x=16, and upwards to y=11.

so, the part of the circle that's inside the rectangle is the part of the circle where x >= 5 and y >= -2.

this corresponds to the part of the circle in the first quadrant relative to its center.

actually, since the center is at (5,-2), and we're considering x >=5 and y >= -2, it's like considering the right half and the upper half of the circle.

but more precisely, it's the part of the circle where both x >=5 and y >= -2.

so, it's a quarter-circle.

wait, is that correct?

let me think.

the circle is centered at (5,-2). the conditions are x >=5 and y >= -2.

in terms of angles, x >=5 corresponds to the right half of the circle, and y >= -2 corresponds to the upper half.

so, the intersection is the quarter-circle in the first quadrant relative to the center.

yes, that makes sense.

therefore, the area of the intersection should be a quarter of the area of the circle.

the area of the full circle is

so, a quarter of that would be

9π

 .

wait, but i need to make sure that the entire quarter-circle lies within the rectangle.

is that the case?

well, the circle only extends to x=8 and y=1, but the rectangle goes up to x=16 and y=11, so yes, the quarter-circle is entirely within the rectangle.

therefore, the area of the intersection is 
9
π
4

9π
​
 .

but wait, i should double-check this.

is the quarter-circle completely inside the rectangle?

the quarter-circle extends from x=5 to x=8 and y=-2 to y=1.

the rectangle starts at x=5 and y=-2, extending to larger x and y.

so, yes, the quarter-circle is entirely within the rectangle.

therefore, the area of intersection is indeed 
9
π
4

9π
​
 .

alternatively, i can think about the angle subtended by this quarter-circle.

since it's a quarter-circle, the angle is 90 degrees, which is 
π

  radians.

the area of a sector of a circle is

so, for a quarter-circle,

 , which matches what i got earlier.

therefore, the area of the intersection is

 .

but just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any parts of the circle that might lie outside the rectangle in this quarter.

given that the rectangle extends beyond the circle in both the x and y directions, there should be no part of the quarter-circle that lies outside the rectangle.

therefore, the area of intersection is indeed 
9

**final answer**
