Problem: In Perfectville, the streets are all $20$ feet wide and the blocks they enclose are all squares of side length $400$ feet, as shown.  Sarah runs around the block on the $400$-foot side of the street, while Sam runs on the opposite side of the street.  How many more feet than Sarah does Sam run for every lap around the block?
