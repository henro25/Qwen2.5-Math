Answer: Given the equation \(\cos(2a - b) + \sin(a + b) = 2\) and \(ab = 4\), we need to find the length of \(bc\).

first, we recognize that the maximum value of both \(\cos\) and \(\sin\) functions is 1. therefore, for their sum to be 2, both \(\cos(2a - b)\) and \(\sin(a + b)\) must each be equal to 1.

1. \(\cos(2a - b) = 1\)
2. \(\sin(a + b) = 1\)

from \(\sin(a + b) = 1\), we have:
\[ a + b = 90^\circ \]

using the angle sum property of a triangle \(a + b + c = 180^\circ\), we find:
\[ c = 180^\circ - (a + b) = 180^\circ - 90^\circ = 90^\circ \]

thus, triangle \(abc\) is a right-angled triangle at \(c\).

next, from \(\cos(2a - b) = 1\), we have:
\[ 2a - b = 0^\circ \]
\[ 2a = b \]

substituting \(b = 2a\) into \(a + b = 90^\circ\):
\[ a + 2a = 90^\circ \]
\[ 3a = 90^\circ \]
\[ a = 30^\circ \]
\[ b = 2a = 60^\circ \]

therefore, the angles are \(a = 30^\circ\), \(b = 60^\circ\), and \(c = 90^\circ\), forming a 30-60-90 triangle.

in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio \(1 : \sqrt{3} : 2\). given that \(ab = 4\) (the hypotenuse), we have:
\[ 2x = 4 \]
\[ x = 2 \]

thus, the side opposite the 30Â° angle (which is \(bc\)) is:
\[ bc = x = 2 \]

therefore, the length of \(bc\) is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]
