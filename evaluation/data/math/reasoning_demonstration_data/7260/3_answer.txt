Answer: To determine how many whole numbers lie in the interval between \(\frac{5}{3}\) and \(2\pi\), we first find the approximate values of these numbers:

\[
\frac{5}{3} \approx 1.6667 \quad \text{and} \quad 2\pi \approx 6.2832
\]

we need to find the whole numbers \(n\) such that:

\[
1.6667 < n < 6.2832
\]

the whole numbers that satisfy this inequality are:

\[
2, 3, 4, 5, 6
\]

counting these numbers, we find there are 5 whole numbers in total.

thus, the number of whole numbers in the interval is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]
