Reasoning: So i have this problem: "how many whole numbers lie in the interval between 5/3 and 2π?" okay, first things first, i need to understand what is being asked. whole numbers are like 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. the problem is asking for how many of these whole numbers are between 5/3 and 2π.

alright, let's break this down step by step. i need to find the interval defined by 5/3 and 2π, and then see which whole numbers fall within that interval.

first, let's find the numerical values of 5/3 and 2π to understand the range we're dealing with.

5 divided by 3 is approximately 1.6667. so, 5/3 ≈ 1.6667.

now, 2π. π is approximately 3.1416, so 2π is about 6.2832.

so, the interval is from approximately 1.6667 to 6.2832.

now, i need to find all whole numbers that lie strictly between these two numbers. since whole numbers are integers starting from 0, and they increase by 1 each time, i can list them out and see which ones fall within this range.

let's list the whole numbers one by one and check:

- 0: is 0 greater than 1.6667? no. so, 0 is less than 1.6667. doesn't qualify.

- 1: is 1 greater than 1.6667? no, because 1 is less than 1.6667. doesn't qualify.

- 2: is 2 greater than 1.6667? yes. is 2 less than 6.2832? yes. so, 2 qualifies.

- 3: is 3 greater than 1.6667? yes. is 3 less than 6.2832? yes. so, 3 qualifies.

- 4: is 4 greater than 1.6667? yes. is 4 less than 6.2832? yes. so, 4 qualifies.

- 5: is 5 greater than 1.6667? yes. is 5 less than 6.2832? yes. so, 5 qualifies.

- 6: is 6 greater than 1.6667? yes. is 6 less than 6.2832? yes. so, 6 qualifies.

- 7: is 7 greater than 1.6667? yes. is 7 less than 6.2832? no. so, 7 does not qualify.

so, from this list, the whole numbers that lie between 1.6667 and 6.2832 are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

that seems straightforward, but let's make sure there are no mistakes here.

first, i need to confirm the values of 5/3 and 2π.

5 divided by 3 is indeed approximately 1.6667.

π is approximately 3.1416, so 2π is approximately 6.2832. that seems correct.

now, whole numbers are non-negative integers: 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on.

the problem says "lie in the interval between 5/3 and 2π." the word "between" typically means strictly greater than the lower bound and strictly less than the upper bound, unless specified otherwise.

so, numbers greater than 1.6667 and less than 6.2832.

therefore:

- 2: 2 > 1.6667 and 2 < 6.2832 → yes

- 3: 3 > 1.6667 and 3 < 6.2832 → yes

- 4: 4 > 1.6667 and 4 < 6.2832 → yes

- 5: 5 > 1.6667 and 5 < 6.2832 → yes

- 6: 6 > 1.6667 and 6 < 6.2832 → yes

- 7: 7 > 1.6667 but 7 > 6.2832 → no

similarly, for numbers below 2:

- 0: 0 < 1.6667 → no

- 1: 1 < 1.6667 → no

therefore, only 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are in that interval.

counting them: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 → that's 5 whole numbers.

wait a minute, is 6 less than 6.2832? yes, because 6 is less than 6.2832.

but just to be thorough, let's double-check the value of 2π. is it indeed approximately 6.2832?

yes, π is approximately 3.1416, so multiplying by 2 gives 6.2832.

also, 5/3 is indeed approximately 1.6667.

now, another way to think about this is to find the smallest whole number greater than 5/3 and the largest whole number less than 2π, and then count the whole numbers in between, inclusive.

the smallest whole number greater than 5/3 (1.6667) is 2.

the largest whole number less than 2π (6.2832) is 6.

now, the whole numbers from 2 to 6 inclusive are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, which is 5 numbers.

alternatively, we can use the formula for the number of integers between two numbers.

if a and b are real numbers, and a < b, then the number of integers n such that a < n < b is floor(b - 1) - ceil(a + 1) + 1.

wait, perhaps a better formula is:

number of integers n with a < n < b is floor(b - 1) - ceil(a + 1) + 1.

but actually, a standard way is to take floor(b - 1) - ceil(a + 1) + 1.

but i think it's easier to just list them out in this case, given the small range.

alternatively, we can consider that the number of whole numbers between two numbers x and y is floor(y) - ceil(x) + 1, assuming x < y.

wait, let's recall that formula.

the number of integers n satisfying a < n < b is floor(b - 1) - ceil(a + 1) + 1.

but in our case, since we're dealing with whole numbers and the interval is open (doesn't include the endpoints), we can adjust accordingly.

alternatively, another approach is to find the smallest integer greater than 5/3, which is 2, and the largest integer less than 2π, which is 6, and then count the integers from 2 to 6 inclusive.

so, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 → 5 numbers.

alternatively, the formula for the number of integers between m and n inclusive is n - m + 1.

here, m = 2 and n = 6, so 6 - 2 + 1 = 5.

that matches our previous count.

therefore, the answer should be 5 whole numbers.

wait a second, but the problem says "between 5/3 and 2π". does "between" include the endpoints?

in mathematics, "between a and b" can be interpreted in different ways. sometimes it includes the endpoints, sometimes it doesn't.

in this problem, it probably means strictly between, since it's an interval, and in mathematical intervals, unless specified as closed, they are usually open.

but to be safe, let's consider both cases.

case 1: strictly between, not including endpoints.

as we've done, numbers greater than 5/3 and less than 2π.

so, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 → 5 numbers.

case 2: including endpoints.

but 5/3 is approximately 1.6667, which is not a whole number, and 2π is approximately 6.2832, which is also not a whole number.

so, even if we include the endpoints, since they are not whole numbers, the set of whole numbers in the interval remains the same: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

therefore, in either case, the answer is 5.

alternatively, if the problem meant to include the endpoints and one of them were whole numbers, but in this case, neither endpoint is a whole number, so inclusion doesn't affect the count.

therefore, the final answer is 5 whole numbers.

**final answer**

5
