Problem: During the car ride home, Michael looks back at his recent math exams. A problem on Michael's calculus mid-term gets him starting thinking about a particular quadratic,\[x^2-sx+p,\]with roots $r_1$ and $r_2$. He notices that\[r_1+r_2=r_1^2+r_2^2=r_1^3+r_2^3=\cdots=r_1^{2007}+r_2^{2007}.\]He wonders how often this is the case, and begins exploring other quantities associated with the roots of such a quadratic. He sets out to compute the greatest possible value of\[\dfrac1{r_1^{2008}}+\dfrac1{r_2^{2008}}.\]Help Michael by computing this maximum.
