Problem: Four red candies and three green candies can be combined to make many different flavors. Flavors are different if the percent red is different, so 3 red / 0 green is the same flavor as 2 red / 0 green; and likewise 4 red / 2 green is the same flavor as 2 red / 1 green. If a flavor is to be made using some or all of the seven candies, how many different flavors are possible?
