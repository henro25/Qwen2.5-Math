Answer: To determine the greatest number of unique four-topping pizzas that can be made from six available toppings, we use combinations, since the order of toppings does not matter.

We are choosing 4 toppings out of 6, which is represented by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{6}{4} = \frac{6!}{4!(6-4)!} = \frac{6!}{4! \cdot 2!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]

Thus, the greatest number of unique four-topping pizzas is **15**.
