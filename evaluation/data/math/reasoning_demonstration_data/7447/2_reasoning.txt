Reasoning: So i have this matrix a, which is a 2x2 matrix:

a
=
(
4
1
−
9
−
2
 
)
a=( 
4
−9
​	
  
1
−2
​	
 )
and i need to compute 
a
100
a 
100
 . that seems like a really high power, and doing it directly by multiplying the matrix by itself 100 times would be super tedious and time-consuming. there must be a smarter way to approach this.

first, i recall that for matrices, one common method to compute high powers is to diagonalize the matrix if possible. diagonalization involves finding a matrix p such that 
p
−
1
a
p
=
d
p 
−1
 ap=d, where 
d
d is a diagonal matrix. if i can do that, then 
a
100
=
p
d
100
p
−
1
a 
100
 =pd 
100
 p 
−1
 , and since 
d
d is diagonal, raising it to the 100th power is straightforward.

so, the first step is to check if 
a
a is diagonalizable. to do that, i need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

to find the eigenvalues, i need to solve the characteristic equation:

det
⁡
(
a
−
λ
i
)
=
0
det(a−λi)=0
where 
i
i is the identity matrix and 
λ
λ represents the eigenvalues.

let's compute 
a
−
λ
i
a−λi:

a
−
λ
i
=
(
4
−
λ
1
−
9
−
2
−
λ
 
)
a−λi=( 
4−λ
−9
​	
  
1
−2−λ
​	
 )
now, the determinant of this matrix is:

det
⁡
(
a
−
λ
i
)
=
(
4
−
λ
)
(
−
2
−
λ
)
−
(
−
9
)
(
1
)
=
(
4
−
λ
)
(
−
2
−
λ
)
+
9
det(a−λi)=(4−λ)(−2−λ)−(−9)(1)=(4−λ)(−2−λ)+9
let's expand this:

(
4
−
λ
)
(
−
2
−
λ
)
=
4
(
−
2
)
+
4
(
−
λ
)
−
λ
(
−
2
)
−
λ
(
λ
)
=
−
8
−
4
λ
+
2
λ
−
λ
2
=
−
8
−
2
λ
−
λ
2
(4−λ)(−2−λ)=4(−2)+4(−λ)−λ(−2)−λ(λ)=−8−4λ+2λ−λ 
2
 =−8−2λ−λ 
2
 
adding 9:

−
8
−
2
λ
−
λ
2
+
9
=
1
−
2
λ
−
λ
2
−8−2λ−λ 
2
 +9=1−2λ−λ 
2
 
so, the characteristic equation is:

−
λ
2
−
2
λ
+
1
=
0
−λ 
2
 −2λ+1=0
i can multiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:

λ
2
+
2
λ
−
1
=
0
λ 
2
 +2λ−1=0
now, to solve this quadratic equation for 
λ
λ, i'll use the quadratic formula:

λ
=
−
b
±
b
2
−
4
a
c
2
a
λ= 
2a
−b± 
b 
2
 −4ac
​	
 
​	
 
here, 
a
=
1
a=1, 
b
=
2
b=2, and 
c
=
−
1
c=−1, so:

λ
=
−
2
±
(
2
)
2
−
4
(
1
)
(
−
1
)
2
(
1
)
=
−
2
±
4
+
4
2
=
−
2
±
8
2
=
−
2
±
2
2
2
=
−
1
±
2
λ= 
2(1)
−2± 
(2) 
2
 −4(1)(−1)
​	
 
​	
 = 
2
−2± 
4+4
​	
 
​	
 = 
2
−2± 
8
​	
 
​	
 = 
2
−2±2 
2
​	
 
​	
 =−1± 
2
​	
 
so, the eigenvalues are:

λ
1
=
−
1
+
2
,
λ
2
=
−
1
−
2
λ 
1
​	
 =−1+ 
2
​	
 ,λ 
2
​	
 =−1− 
2
​	
 
since the eigenvalues are distinct, the matrix 
a
a is diagonalizable. that's good news!

next, i need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.

starting with 
λ
1
=
−
1
+
2
λ 
1
​	
 =−1+ 
2
​	
 , i need to solve:

(
a
−
λ

i
)
v
=
0
(a−λ 
1
​	
 i)v=0
substituting 
λ

λ

​	
 :

(

−
(
−

)

−

)
(
v

)
=

(

 )
​	
 )( 
v

​	
 
v

​

 )=(

​	
 
​	
 )( 
v 
1
​	
 
v 
2
​	
 
​	
 )=(

​	
 )
this gives us the system of equations:

(

v

v

v

​	
 =0
−9v

​	
 +(−1−

​

from the first equation, we can express 
v

v

​	
  in terms of 
v

v

​	
 :

v

)
v
1
v

​	
 =−(5−

​	
 )v

​	
 
so, an eigenvector corresponding to 
λ

λ

​	
  is:

v

v

​	
 =(

​	
 )
similarly, for 
λ

=
−

−

λ

​	
 =−1−

​	
 , we solve:

(

v

substituting

this gives us:

v

v

so, an eigenvector corresponding to

  is:

v

v

​	
 =(

−(5+

​

now, i can form the matrix 
p

p
=

−
(

p=(

​	
 )
and the diagonal matrix

 )
now, 
a

=
p
d
100
p
−

a 
100
 =pd 
100
 p 
−1
 .

to compute this, i need to find 
p
−

p

 . let's compute the determinant of 
p
p:

det

(
p

=

det(p)=(1)(−(5+

 +5−

​	
 =−2

so, the inverse of

now,

this looks pretty messy. maybe there's a better way to handle this.

alternatively, since 
a
a satisfies its own characteristic equation, i can use the cayley-hamilton theorem, which states that a matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation. the characteristic equation we found was:

λ
2
+
2
λ
−
1
=
0
λ 
2
 +2λ−1=0
so, 
a
2
+
2
a
−
i
=
0
a 
2
 +2a−i=0, where 
0
0 is the zero matrix.

this gives a recurrence relation for powers of 
a
a:

a
2
=
−

a
+
i
a

 =−2a+i
maybe i can use this to find a pattern or a general formula for

hmm, that seems arbitrary. maybe using the recurrence relation is better.

from the cayley-hamilton theorem, we have:

a
2
=
−
2
a
+
i
a 
2
 =−2a+i
let's try to find a general expression for 
a
n
a 
n
  in terms of 
a
a and 
i
i.

assume that 
a
n
=
p
a
+
q
i
a 
n
 =pa+qi, where p and q are scalars to be determined.

let's test this assumption for n=1 and n=2:

for n=1:

a
1
=
p
a
+
q
i
  
⟹
  
a
=
p
a
+
q
i
a 
1
 =pa+qi⟹a=pa+qi
comparing coefficients, we get:

p
=
1
,
q
=
0
p=1,q=0
for n=2:

a
2
=
p
a
+
q
i
a 
2
 =pa+qi
but from the cayley-hamilton theorem:

a
2
=
−
2
a
+
i
a 
2
 =−2a+i
so, p = -2, q = 1.

that matches.

now, assume that for some n, 
a
n
=
p
n
a
+
q
n
i
a 
n
 =p 
n
​	
 a+q 
n
​	
 i, and find a recurrence relation for p_n and q_n.

using the relation 
a
n
+
1
=
a
⋅
a
n
a 
n+1
 =a⋅a 
n
 :

a
n
+
1
=
a
(
p
n
a
+
q
n
i
)
=
p
n
a
2
+
q
n
a
a 
n+1
 =a(p 
n
​	
 a+q 
n
​	
 i)=p 
n
​	
 a 
2
 +q 
n
​	
 a
but 
a
2
=
−
2
a
+
i
a 
2
 =−2a+i, so:

a
n
+
1
=
p
n
(
−

a

i
)
+
q
n
a
=
(
−

)
a
+
p

a

 =p

​	
 (−2a+i)+q 
n
​	
 a=(−2p 
n
​	
 +q 
n
​	
 )a+p 
n
​	
 i
therefore, we have:

a
n

=
(
−

)
a
+
p
n
i
a 
n+1
 =(−2p

​	
 +q

​	
 )a+p 
n
​	
 i
comparing this with the assumed form 
a
n
+

 i, we get the recurrence relations:

​	
 
this is a system of linear recurrences. to solve it, i can write it in matrix form or look for a pattern.

let's try to find a pattern by computing the first few terms.

we already have:

for n=1:

p
1
=
1
,
q
1
=
0
p 
1
​	
 =1,q 
1
​	
 =0
for n=2:

p
2
=
−
2
,
q
2
=
1
p 
2
​	
 =−2,q 
2
​	
 =1
for n=3:

p
3
=
−
2
p
2
+
q
2
=
−
2
(
−
2
)
+
1
=

+
1
=

q
3
=
p

=
−
2
p 
3
​	
 =−2p 
2
​	
 +q 
2
​	
 =−2(−2)+1=4+1=5
q 
3
​	
 =p 
2
​	
 =−2
for n=4:

p
4
=
−
2
p
3
+
q
3
=
−
2
(

)
+
(
−
2
)
=
−
10
−
2
=
−

q

=
p
3
=
5
p 
4
​	
 =−2p 
3
​	
 +q 
3
​	
 =−2(5)+(−2)=−10−2=−12
q 
4
​	
 =p 
3
​	
 =5
for n=5:

p
5
=
−
2
p
4
+
q
4
=
−
2
(
−
12
)
+
5
=
24
+
5
=

q
5
=
p
4
=
−
12
p 
5
​	
 =−2p 
4
​	
 +q 
4
​	
 =−2(−12)+5=24+5=29
q 
5
​	
 =p 
4
​	
 =−12
i can see that the sequences for p_n and q_n are alternating in sign and growing in magnitude, but it's not immediately obvious what the general form is.

maybe i can solve the recurrence relations directly.

we have:

p
n
+
1
=
−
2
p
n
+
q
n
q
n
+
1
=
p
n
p 
n+1
​	
 =−2p 
n
​	
 +q 
n
​	
 
q 
n+1
​	
 =p 
n
​	
 
substituting the second equation into the first:

p
n
+
1
=
−
2
p
n
+
p
n
−
1
p 
n+1
​	
 =−2p 
n
​	
 +p 
n−1
​	
 
wait, if 
q
n
=
p
n
−
1
q 
n
​	
 =p 
n−1
​	
 , then:

p
n
+
1
=
−
2
p
n
+
p
n
−
1
p 
n+1
​	
 =−2p 
n
​	
 +p 
n−1
​	
 
so, we have a second-order linear recurrence for p_n:

p
n
+
1
+
2
p
n
−
p
n
−
1
=
0
p 
n+1
​	
 +2p 
n
​	
 −p 
n−1
​	
 =0
the characteristic equation for this recurrence is:

r
2
+
2
r
−
1
=
0
r 
2
 +2r−1=0
solving for r:

r
=
−
2
±
4
+
4
2
=
−
2
±
8
2
=
−
2
±
2
2
2
=
−
1
±
2
r= 
2
−2± 
4+4
​	
 
​	
 = 
2
−2± 
8
​	
 
​	
 = 
2
−2±2 
2
​	
 
​	
 =−1± 
2
​	
 
so, the general solution for p_n is:

p
n
=
a
(
−
1
+
2
)
n
+
b
(
−
1
−
2
)
n
p 
n
​	
 =a(−1+ 
2
​	
 ) 
n
 +b(−1− 
2
​	
 ) 
n
 
similarly, since 
q
n
=
p
n
−
1
q 
n
​	
 =p 
n−1
​	
 , we have:

q
n
=
a
(
−
1
+
2
)
n
−
1
+
b
(
−
1
−
2
)
n
−
1
q 
n
​	
 =a(−1+ 
2
​	
 ) 
n−1
 +b(−1− 
2
​	
 ) 
n−1
 
now, using the initial conditions to solve for a and b.

for n=1:

p
1
=
a
(
−
1
+
2
)
1
+
b
(
−
1
−
2
)
1
=
a
(
−
1
+
2
)
+
b
(
−
1
−
2
)
=
1
p 
1
​	
 =a(−1+ 
2
​	
 ) 
1
 +b(−1− 
2
​	
 ) 
1
 =a(−1+ 
2
​	
 )+b(−1− 
2
​	
 )=1
for n=2:

p
2
=
a
(
−
1
+
2
)
2
+
b
(
−
1
−
2
)
2
=
a
(
1
−
2
2
+

)
+
b
(

+

2
+

)
=
a
(
3
−

)
+
b
(

+

)
=
−

p 
2
​	
 =a(−1+ 
2
​	
 ) 
2
 +b(−1− 
2
​	
 ) 
2
 =a(1−2 
2
​	
 +2)+b(1+2 
2
​	
 +2)=a(3−2 
2
​	
 )+b(3+2 
2
​	
 )=−2
so, we have the system of equations:

a
(
−
1
+
2
)
+
b
(
−
1
−
2
)
=
1
(1)
a
(
3
−
2
2
)
+
b
(
3
+
2

)
=
−
2
(2)
a(−1+ 
2
​	
 )+b(−1− 
2
​	
 )=1(1)
a(3−2 
2
​	
 )+b(3+2 
2
​	
 )=−2(2)
let's solve this system for a and b.

first, equation (1):

−
a
−
b
+
a
2
−
b
2
=
1
−a−b+a 
2
​	
 −b 
2
​	
 =1
grouping like terms:

(
−
a
−
b
)
+
(
a
−
b
)
2
=
1
(−a−b)+(a−b) 
2
​	
 =1
since 
2
2
​	
  is irrational, the coefficients of the rational and irrational parts must separately equal the corresponding parts on the right side. therefore:

−
a
−
b
=
1
(a)
a
−
b
=
0
(b)
−a−b=1(a)
a−b=0(b)
from equation (b):

a
=
b
a=b
substituting into equation (a):

−
a
−
a
=
1
  
⟹
  
−
2
a
=
1
  
⟹
  
a
=
−
1
2
−a−a=1⟹−2a=1⟹a=− 
2
1
​	
 
since 
a
=
b
a=b, then 
b
=
−
1
2
b=− 
2
1
​	
 

now, plugging a and b back into the expressions for p_n and q_n:

p
n
=
−
1
2
(
−
1
+
2
)
n
−

(
−

 (−1+

​	
 ) 
n−1
 − 
2
1
​	
 (−1− 
2
​	
 ) 
n−1
 
therefore, the general expression for 
a
n
a

  is:

a

=
p

+

=
(
−

n−1
 )i
this still seems quite complicated. maybe there's a better way to express this.

alternatively, since we have the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, perhaps i can express 
a
100
a 
100
  directly using them.

recall that:

a
100
=
p
d
100
p
−
1
a 
100
 =pd 
100
 p 
−1
 
where:

p
=
(
1
1
−
(
5
−
2
)
−
(
5
+
2
)
 
)
,
d
=
(
−

+

0
0
−
1
−

)
,
p
−
1
=
1
2
2
(
5
+
2

−
5
+
2
−
1
 
)
p=( 
1
−(5−

​	
 )
​	
  
1
−(5+

​	
 )
​	
 ),d=( 
−1+

​

​

 ),p

 =

​	
 ( 
5+ 
2
​	
 
−5+ 
2
​	
 
​	
  
1
−1
​	
 )
so, plugging in:

a
100
=
(
1
1
−
(
5
−
2
)
−
(
5
+
2

a

 )

 )

​	
 ( 
5+

​	
 
−5+

​	
 
​

​	
 )
this is quite involved, but perhaps i can simplify it further.

first, let's compute the product of the first two matrices:

(
1

)
=

​

 )
​	
 )( 
(−1+

​	
  
0
(−1−

 ) 
100
 
​	
 )=( 
1⋅(−1+

−(5−

​

 ) 
100
 
−(5+

​	
 )⋅(−1−

 ) 
100
 
​	
 )
then, multiply this by 
p

 :

this is getting really complicated. maybe there's a better approach.

let me think differently. since the eigenvalues are 
−
1
±
2
−1± 
2
​	
 , and they are real and distinct, the matrix 
a
a can be expressed in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and powers of 
a
a can be expressed similarly.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the fact that 
a
a can be expressed as 
a
=
i
+
n
a=i+n, where 
n
n is a nilpotent matrix, but given the eigenvalues, that doesn't seem applicable here.

wait, maybe i can consider the jordan form, but since the matrix is diagonalizable, the jordan form is just the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the fact that 
a
a satisfies its characteristic equation and find a pattern in the powers based on that.

let me see what 
a
n
a 
n
  looks like in terms of 
a
a and 
i
i.

from earlier, i have:

a
n
=
p
n
a
+
q
n
i
a 
n
 =p 
n
​	
 a+q 
n
​	
 i
with the recurrence:

p
n
+
1
=
−
2
p
n
+
q
n
q
n
+
1
=
p
n
p 
n+1
​	
 =−2p 
n
​	
 +q 
n
​	
 
q 
n+1
​	
 =p 
n
​	
 
and the general solution for 
p
n
p 
n
​	
  is:

p
n
=
a
(
−
1
+
2
)
n
+
b
(
−
1
−
2
)
n
p 
n
​	
 =a(−1+ 
2
​	
 ) 
n
 +b(−1− 
2
​	
 ) 
n
 
with 
a
=
b
=
−
1
2
a=b=− 
2
1
​	
 

similarly, 
q
n
=
p
n
−
1
q 
n
​	
 =p 
n−1
​	
 , so:

q
n
=
a
(
−
1
+

)
n
−
1
+

this seems too convoluted. maybe there's a different approach altogether.

wait a minute, perhaps i can use the fact that 
a
a can be expressed in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and then use that to compute 
a
100
a 
100
 .

alternatively, maybe i can use the fact that 
a
a is similar to a diagonal matrix, and thus its powers are easy to compute.

wait, that's essentially what i did earlier with the diagonalization approach.

perhaps another way is to consider the matrix exponential, but that might not be simpler for integer powers.

alternatively, maybe i can use the minimal polynomial of 
a
a, but since the characteristic polynomial is already degree 2 and the matrix is diagonalizable, the minimal polynomial is the same as the characteristic polynomial.

given that, perhaps i can express 
a
100
a 
100
  in terms of 
a
a and 
i
i using the characteristic equation.

from the characteristic equation:

a
2
=
−
2
a
+
i
a 
2
 =−2a+i
then, 
a
3
=
a
⋅
a

=
a
(
−
2
a
+
i
)
=
−
2
a

a
=

(

a
=

a

a

a 
3
 =a⋅a 
2
 =a(−2a+i)=−2a 
2
 +a=−2(−2a+i)+a=4a−2i+a=5a−2i

similarly, 
a
4
=
a
⋅
a
3
=
a
(
5
a
−
2
i
)
=
5
a
2
−
2
a
=

(
−

a

i
)
−

a
=

a

5
i
−
2
a
=
−
12
a
+
5
i
a 
4
 =a⋅a 
3
 =a(5a−2i)=5a 
2
 −2a=5(−2a+i)−2a=−10a+5i−2a=−12a+5i

i can see a pattern here, but it's not immediately clear how to generalize it for 
a
100
a 
100
 .

alternatively, perhaps i can use the fact that the eigenvalues are 
−
1
±
2
−1± 
2
​	
 , and thus the matrix can be expressed in terms of these eigenvalues, and then raise them to the 100th power.

but this seems similar to the diagonalization approach.

alternatively, maybe i can consider the matrix as a linear recurrence relation.

wait, perhaps using the fact that the entries of 
a
n
a 
n
  satisfy a linear recurrence based on the characteristic equation.

given that 
a
2
=
−
2
a
+
i
a 
2
 =−2a+i, then for any power n >= 2, 
a
n
=
−
2
a
n
−
1
+
a
n
−
2
a 
n
 =−2a 
n−1
 +a 
n−2
 

this is a linear recurrence relation for the matrix powers.

now, perhaps i can find a closed-form expression for 
a
n
a 
n
  using this recurrence.

this is similar to solving a linear recurrence for sequences, where the general solution is a linear combination of terms based on the roots of the characteristic equation.

given that, and since we have the eigenvalues, perhaps i can express 
a
n
a 
n
  as a linear combination of 
λ
1
n
λ 
1
n
​	
  and 
λ
2
n
λ 
2
n
​	
 , similar to how it's done for sequences.

specifically, maybe:

a
n
=
c
1
λ
1
n
v
1
+
c
2
λ
2
n
v
2
a 
n
 =c 
1
​	
 λ 
1
n
​	
 v 
1
​	
 +c 
2
​	
 λ 
2
n
​	
 v 
2
​	
 
but this doesn't seem directly applicable since 
v
1
v 
1
​	
  and \mathbf{v}_2\) are eigenvectors, and i need to reconstruct the matrix.

alternatively, perhaps i can express 
a
n
a 
n
  in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors as follows:

a
n
=
p
d
n
p
−
1
a 
n
 =pd 
n
 p 
−1
 
which is exactly the diagonalization approach.

given that, and having computed 
p
p, 
d
d, and 
p
−
1
p 
−1
 , perhaps i should just proceed with that, even if it's a bit messy.

so, summarizing:

this is extremely cumbersome. maybe there's a better way to approach this.

let me think again about the general expression for

a
n
=
p
n
a
+
q
n
i
a 
n

​	
 
and the general solution for 
p

p

​	
 :

p

with

a=b=−

 , and 
q

=

now, notice that 
−
1
+
2
−1+ 
2
​	
  and 
−
1
−
2
−1− 
2
​	
  are reciprocals of each other because:

(

(

)
=
1
−
2
=
−
1
(−1+ 
2
​	
 )(−1− 
2
​	
 )=1−2=−1
but i'm not sure if that helps directly here.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the fact that these terms are related through complex conjugation, but since they are real numbers, that might not apply.

another thought: perhaps i can express 
(
−
1
+
2
)
n
(−1+ 
2
​	
 ) 
n
  and 
(
−
1
−
2
)
n
(−1− 
2
​	
 ) 
n
  in terms of hyperbolic functions or something similar, but that might be overcomplicating things.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that 
(
−
1
+
2
)
(−1+ 
2
​	
 ) is less than 1 in magnitude, and 
(
−
1
−
2
)
(−1− 
2
​	
 ) is less than 1 in magnitude in absolute value, but actually, 
−
1
−
2
−1− 
2
​	
  is approximately -2.414, which is greater than 1 in magnitude.

wait, let's calculate the magnitudes:

∣
−
1
+
2
∣
≈
∣
−
1
+
1.414
∣
=
∣
0.414
∣
=
0.414
∣
−
1
−
2
∣
≈
∣
−
1
−
1.414
∣
=
∣
−
2.414
∣
=
2.414
∣−1+ 
2
​	
 ∣≈∣−1+1.414∣=∣0.414∣=0.414
∣−1− 
2
​	
 ∣≈∣−1−1.414∣=∣−2.414∣=2.414
so, one eigenvalue has magnitude less than 1, and the other has magnitude greater than 1.

this means that as n increases, the term with 
(
−
1
−
2
)
n
(−1− 
2
​	
 ) 
n
  will dominate, while the term with 
(
−
1
+
2
)
n
(−1+ 
2
​	
 ) 
n
  will become negligible.

however, since n=100 is very large, and 
(
−
1
−
2
)
100
(−1− 
2
​	
 ) 
100
  is a huge number, while 
(
−
1
+
2
)
100
(−1+ 
2
​	
 ) 
100
  is a very small number (since its magnitude is less than 1), perhaps for practical purposes, the term with 
(
−
1
+
2
)
100
(−1+ 
2
​	
 ) 
100
  can be considered negligible.

but for an exact expression, i need to keep both terms.

given that, perhaps i can accept that 
a
100
a 
100
  will have entries involving 
(
−
1
+
2
)
100
(−1+ 
2
​	
 ) 
100
  and 
(
−

)
100
(−1− 
2
​

 , and that's as simplified as it gets.

alternatively, maybe there's a way to express these terms in a more compact form.

let me consider the general expression again:

a
100
=
−
1
2
[
(
−
1
+
2
)
100
+
(
−

]

)

]

1
​	
 [(−1+

​	
 ) 
99
 +(−1−

​

 ]i
i can factor out 
(
−
1
+
2
)
99
(−1+ 
2
​	
 ) 
99
  and 
(
−
1
−
2
)
99
(−1− 
2
​	
 ) 
99
 :

a
100
=
−

[
(
−

+

but this doesn't seem to lead to significant simplification.

another idea: perhaps i can use the fact that 
(
−
1
+
2
)
(−1+ 
2
​	
 ) and 
(
−
1
−
2
)
(−1− 
2
​	
 ) are roots of the characteristic equation, and find a relationship between them.

alternatively, maybe i can consider expressing 
a
100
a 
100
  in terms of lower powers and look for a pattern, but that seems impractical for such a high power.

given all this, perhaps the expression i have for 
a
100
a 
100
  is as simplified as it can be without numerical approximation.

therefore, the final expression for 
a
100
a 
100
  is:

a
100
=
−
1
2
[
(
−

 ](

this is an exact expression, but it's quite unwieldy. for practical purposes, one might consider numerical approximation of the terms involving 
(
−
1
+
2
)
100
(−1+ 
2
​	
 ) 
100
  and 
(
−
1
−
2
)
100
(−1− 
2
​	
 ) 
100
 , but that would not be an exact answer.

therefore, the final answer is:

a
100

(
