Answer: Given a triangular piece of paper \(abc\) with base \(ab = 12 \text{ cm}\), the paper is folded down over the base with crease \(de\) parallel to \(ab\). the area of the triangle that projects below the base is \(16\%\) of the area of triangle \(abc\). we need to find the length of \(de\).

since \(de\) is parallel to \(ab\), triangles \(ade\) and \(abc\) are similar. let \(k\) be the ratio of similarity, where \(k = \frac{de}{ab}\).

the area of triangle \(ade\) is \(16\%\) of the area of triangle \(abc\), so:
\[
k^2 = 0.16
\]
solving for \(k\):
\[
k = \sqrt{0.16} = 0.4
\]
thus, the length of \(de\) is:
\[
de = k \times ab = 0.4 \times 12 = 4.8 \text{ cm}
\]

therefore, the length of \(de\) is:
\[
\boxed{4.8}
\]
