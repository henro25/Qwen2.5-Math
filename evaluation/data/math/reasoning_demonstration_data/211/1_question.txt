Problem: The base of a triangular piece of paper $ABC$ is $12\text{ cm}$ long. The paper is folded down over the base, with the crease $DE$ parallel to the base of the paper. The area of the triangle that projects below the base is $16\%$ that of the area of the triangle $ABC.$ What is the length of $DE,$ in cm?
