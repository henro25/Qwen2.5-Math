Problem: Complex numbers are often used when dealing with alternating current (AC) circuits. In the equation $V = IZ$, $V$ is voltage, $I$ is current, and $Z$ is a value known as impedance. If $V = 1-i$ and $Z=1+3i$, find $I$.  Express your answer as a complex number in the form $a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.
