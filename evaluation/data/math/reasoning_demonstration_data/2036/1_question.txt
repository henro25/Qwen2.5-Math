Problem: The polynomial $P(x)$ is a monic, quartic polynomial with real coefficients, and two of its roots are $\cos \theta + i \sin \theta$ and $\sin \theta + i \cos \theta,$ where $0 < \theta < \frac{\pi}{4}.$  When the four roots of $P(x)$ are plotted in the complex plane, they form a quadrilateral whose area is equal to half of $P(0).$  Find the sum of the four roots.
