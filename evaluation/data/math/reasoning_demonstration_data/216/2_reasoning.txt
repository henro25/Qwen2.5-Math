Reasoning: So i have this problem here: "how many digits are located to the right of the decimal point when $\frac{3^6}{6^4 \cdot 625}$ is expressed as a decimal?"

alright, let's start by simplifying the expression inside the fraction. i have $3^6$ in the numerator and $6^4 \cdot 625$ in the denominator. i should probably simplify the denominator first.

i know that $6^4$ is the same as $(2 \cdot 3)^4$, because 6 is 2 times 3. so, $(2 \cdot 3)^4 = 2^4 \cdot 3^4$. therefore, the denominator becomes $2^4 \cdot 3^4 \cdot 625$.

so now the fraction looks like $\frac{3^6}{2^4 \cdot 3^4 \cdot 625}$. i can simplify this by canceling out the $3^4$ in the numerator and the denominator.

that gives me $\frac{3^{6-4}}{2^4 \cdot 625} = \frac{3^2}{2^4 \cdot 625}$. since $3^2$ is 9, and $2^4$ is 16, the fraction is now $\frac{9}{16 \cdot 625}$.

now, i need to calculate $16 \cdot 625$. let's see, 16 times 600 is 9600, and 16 times 25 is 400, so adding those together, 9600 + 400 = 10,000. so the denominator is 10,000.

now the fraction is $\frac{9}{10,000}$. to express this as a decimal, i know that dividing by 10,000 moves the decimal point four places to the left.

so, 9 divided by 10,000 is 0.0009.

now, the question is asking how many digits are to the right of the decimal point in this decimal expression.

looking at 0.0009, there are four digits after the decimal point: 0, 0, 0, and 9.

therefore, there are four digits to the right of the decimal point.

wait, but i should make sure that this is indeed correct. maybe i should double-check my steps.

starting over: $\frac{3^6}{6^4 \cdot 625}$.

calculate $3^6$: 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729.

calculate $6^4$: 6^2 is 36, 6^3 is 216, 6^4 is 1296.

so the denominator is 1296 * 625.

let me calculate 1296 * 625.

first, 1296 * 600 = 777,600.

then, 1296 * 25 = 32,400.

adding them together: 777,600 + 32,400 = 810,000.

so the denominator is 810,000.

now the fraction is $\frac{729}{810,000}$.

i can simplify this fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 81.

729 divided by 81 is 9.

810,000 divided by 81 is 10,000.

so again, i get $\frac{9}{10,000}$, which is 0.0009.

so, yes, there are four digits to the right of the decimal point.

alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to approach this without calculating all these big numbers.

let me think about the properties of decimals and fractions.

i know that a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ will have a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator b, after simplifying the fraction, has no prime factors other than 2 and 5.

in this case, the denominator is $2^4 \cdot 3^4 \cdot 625$.

wait, earlier i simplified it to $2^4 \cdot 3^4 \cdot 5^4$, since 625 is 5^4.

but then, when i canceled out the 3's, i had $2^4 \cdot 5^4$ in the denominator.

wait, let me check that again.

original denominator: $6^4 \cdot 625 = (2 \cdot 3)^4 \cdot 5^4 = 2^4 \cdot 3^4 \cdot 5^4$.

numerator: $3^6$.

so the fraction is $\frac{3^6}{2^4 \cdot 3^4 \cdot 5^4} = \frac{3^{6-4}}{2^4 \cdot 5^4} = \frac{3^2}{2^4 \cdot 5^4} = \frac{9}{(2 \cdot 5)^4} = \frac{9}{10^4} = \frac{9}{10,000} = 0.0009$.

yes, that's consistent with what i did earlier.

now, to find how many digits are to the right of the decimal point, i can look at the decimal representation, which is 0.0009, and count the digits after the decimal.

there are four digits: 0, 0, 0, and 9.

therefore, the answer is 4.

alternatively, since the denominator is $10^4$, and any fraction of the form $\frac{a}{10^n}$ will have n digits after the decimal point, as long as a is an integer and has fewer than n digits or appropriately padded with zeros.

in this case, n is 4, so there are 4 digits after the decimal point.

so, again, the answer is 4.

i think that's solid.

**final answer**
