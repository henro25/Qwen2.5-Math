Answer: To determine how many digits are located to the right of the decimal point when \(\frac{3^6}{6^4 \cdot 625}\) is expressed as a decimal, we start by simplifying the expression.

first, we rewrite the denominator:
\[
6^4 = (2 \cdot 3)^4 = 2^4 \cdot 3^4
\]
thus, the denominator becomes:
\[
2^4 \cdot 3^4 \cdot 625
\]
the fraction is now:
\[
\frac{3^6}{2^4 \cdot 3^4 \cdot 625}
\]
simplifying the numerator and denominator by canceling \(3^4\):
\[
\frac{3^{6-4}}{2^4 \cdot 625} = \frac{3^2}{2^4 \cdot 625}
\]
since \(3^2 = 9\), \(2^4 = 16\), and \(625 = 5^4\), the fraction becomes:
\[
\frac{9}{16 \cdot 625}
\]
calculating the denominator:
\[
16 \cdot 625 = 10,000
\]
so the fraction is:
\[
\frac{9}{10,000}
\]
this fraction as a decimal is:
\[
0.0009
\]
there are 4 digits to the right of the decimal point in 0.0009.

therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
