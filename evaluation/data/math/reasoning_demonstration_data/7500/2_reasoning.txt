Reasoning: Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate 54 times 46 in my head. Hmm, that's a bit tricky because both numbers are not too small, and multiplying them directly might be a bit of a stretch for mental math. Let me see if I can break this down into smaller, more manageable parts.

First, I know that multiplication is distributive, so maybe I can split one of the numbers into parts that are easier to work with. Let's try splitting 46 into 40 and 6. So, 54 times 46 is the same as 54 times (40 plus 6). Using the distributive property, that would be 54 times 40 plus 54 times 6.

Alright, let's calculate 54 times 40 first. I know that 54 times 4 is 216, and since 40 is 4 times 10, I just need to add a zero to 216, making it 2160. So, 54 times 40 is 2160.

Next, I need to calculate 54 times 6. I know that 50 times 6 is 300, and 4 times 6 is 24. So, adding those together, 300 plus 24 is 324. Therefore, 54 times 6 is 324.

Now, I just need to add those two results together: 2160 plus 324. Let's see, 2160 plus 300 is 2460, and then adding the remaining 24 gives me 2484. So, 54 times 46 should be 2484.

Wait a minute, is there another way to check this? Maybe I can try a different approach to confirm that I got the right answer. Another method that comes to mind is using the difference of squares formula. I recall that (a+b)(a-b) equals a squared minus b squared, but in this case, I don't see an immediate way to apply that.

Alternatively, I could try to use the fact that 54 is close to 50 and 46 is close to 50 as well. Let me think about that. If I consider 54 as (50 + 4) and 46 as (50 - 4), then I can use the formula for (a+b)(a-b), which is a squared minus b squared. So, (50 + 4)(50 - 4) equals 50 squared minus 4 squared, which is 2500 minus 16, giving me 2484. Hey, that matches my previous result!

That's reassuring. So, both methods give me the same answer, which makes me more confident that 2484 is correct. I guess I can conclude that 54 times 46 is indeed 2484.

But just to be thorough, let me try one more approach. Maybe I can break down both numbers further. For example, 54 is 50 plus 4, and 46 is 40 plus 6. So, using the distributive property again, I can calculate 50 times 40, which is 2000, plus 50 times 6, which is 300, plus 4 times 40, which is 160, plus 4 times 6, which is 24. Adding all those together: 2000 plus 300 is 2300, plus 160 is 2460, plus 24 is 2484. Again, I get the same answer.

I think I've confirmed it enough times. It's definitely 2484.
