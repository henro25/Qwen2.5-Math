Problem: George is about to get a certain amount of change less than one dollar from the cash register. If he gets the most quarters possible and the rest in pennies, he would need to receive 3 pennies to meet the amount. If he gets the most dimes possible and the rest in pennies, he would need to receive 8 pennies to meet the amount. What is the sum, in cents, of the possible amounts of change that he is trying to get?
