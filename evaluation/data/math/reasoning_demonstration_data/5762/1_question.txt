Problem: The equations of the asymptotes of a hyperbola are $y = 2x+5$ and $y = -2x+1.$ Given that the hyperbola passes through the point $(0, 7),$ the standard form for the equation of the hyperbola is \[\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} = 1,\]where $a,$ $b$, $h,$ and $k$ are constants with $a, b > 0.$ Find $a + h.$
