Reasoning: So i've got this problem here. it says that there's a matrix that projects vectors onto a line ℓ that passes through the origin, and i need to find the direction vector of that line. the matrix is given, and it's a 3x3 matrix. let me write it down again to make sure i have it right:

p
=
(
2
15
−
1
15
−
1
3
−
1
15
1
30
1
6
−
1
3
1
6
5
6
)
p= 
​
  
15
2
​
 
− 
15
1
​
 
− 
3
1
​
 
​
  
− 
15
1
​
 
30

​
 
6

​
 
​
  
− 
3
1
​
 
6
1
​
 
6
5
​
 
​
  
​
 
i need to find a direction vector 
v
=
(
a
b
c
)
v= 
​
  
a
b
c
​
  
​
  such that this matrix projects any vector onto the line spanned by 
v
v. and i need to make sure that 
a
>
0
a>0 and that the greatest common divisor of the absolute values of 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c is 1.

first, i need to recall how projection matrices work. if i have a line in 3d space, and i want to project any vector onto that line, the projection matrix 
p
p can be expressed in terms of the direction vector 
v
v of the line. specifically, the projection matrix onto the line spanned by 
v
v is given by:

p
=
v
v
t
v
t
v
p= 
v 
t
 v
vv 
t
 
​
 
this formula makes sense because 
v
v
t
vv 
t
  is an outer product that gives a matrix, and dividing by 
v
t
v
v 
t
 v (which is just the squared magnitude of 
v
v) normalizes it appropriately.

so, if i have 
p
p, i can set it equal to 
v
v
t
v
t
v
v 
t
 v
vv 
t
 
​
  and try to solve for 
v
v.

let me denote 
v
=
(
a
b
c
)
v= 
​
  
a
b
c
​
  
​
 , where 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c are real numbers. then, the outer product 
v
v
t
vv 
t
  is:

v
v
t
=
(
a
b
c
)
(
a
b
c
)
=
(
a
2
a
b
a
c
b
a
b
2
b
c
c
a
c
b
c
2
)
vv 
t
 = 
​
  
a
b
c
​
  
​
 ( 
a
​
  
b
​
  
c
​
 )= 
​
  
a 
2
 
ba
ca
​
  
ab
b 
2
 
cb
​
  
ac
bc
c 
2
 
​
  
​
 
and 
v
t
v
=
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
v 
t
 v=a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 .

so, the projection matrix should be:

p
=
1
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
(
a
2
a
b
a
c
b
a
b
2
b
c
c
a
c
b
c
2
)
p= 
a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 
1
​
  
​
  
a 
2
 
ba
ca
​
  
ab
b 
2
 
cb
​
  
ac
bc
c 
2
 
​
  
​
 
now, i can set this equal to the given matrix and try to solve for 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c:

1
a
2
+
b
2
+

(

hmm, i see that equations 2 and 4 are the same since

let me denote 
k
=
a

b

c

k=a

now, i have expressions for

a

 , 
b
2
b

 , and 
c
2
c

  in terms of 
k
k, and also expressions for the products 
a
b

a
c
ac, and 
b
c
bc in terms of 
k
k.

i need to find 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c, so perhaps i can express 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c in terms of 
k
k, and then solve for 
k
k.

first, from equation 1: 
a
2
=
2
15
k
a 
2
 = 
15
2
​
 k, so 
a
=
2
15
k
a= 
15
2
​
 k
​
  or 
a
=
−
2
15
k
a=− 
15
2
​
 k
​
 . but since the problem states that 
a
>
0
a>0, i'll take the positive root: 
a
=
2
15
k
a= 
15
2
​
 k
​
 .

similarly, from equation 5: 
b
2
=
1
30
k
b 
2
 = 
30
1
​
 k, so 
b
=
1
30
k
b= 
30
1
​
 k
​
  or 
b
=
−
1
30
k
b=− 
30
1
​
 k
​
 .

from equation 9: 
c
2
=
5
6
k
c 
2
 = 
6
5
​
 k, so 
c
=
5
6
k
c= 
6
5
​
 k
​
  or 
c
=
−
5
6
k
c=− 
6
5
​
 k
​
 .

now, from equation 2: 
a
b
=
−
1
15
k
ab=− 
15
1
​
 k.

substituting the expressions for 
a
a and 
b
b:

2
15
k
⋅
b
=
−
1
15
k
15
2
​
 k
​
 ⋅b=− 
15
1
​
 k
but 
b
=
±
1
30
k
b=± 
30
1
​
 k
​
 , so:

2
15
k
⋅
(
±
1
30
k
)
=
−
1
15
k
15
2
​
 k
​
 ⋅(± 
30
1
​
 k
​
 )=− 
15
1
​
 k
let me compute the left side:

2
15
k
⋅
1
30
k
=
2
15
⋅
1
30
⋅
k
=

450
⋅
k
=

⋅
k
=

k

​
 k
​
 ⋅

​
 k
​
 =

​
 ⋅

​
 
​
 ⋅k= 
450
2
​
 
​
 ⋅k= 
225
1
​
 
​
 ⋅k= 
15
1
​
 k
so, we have:

±
1
15
k
=
−
1
15
k
± 
15
1
​
 k=− 
15
1
​
 k
this implies that the positive root for 
b
b would give 
+
1
15
k
+ 
15
1
​
 k, which doesn't match 
−
1
15
k
− 
15
1
​
 k, so 
b
b must be negative. therefore, 
b
=
−
1
30
k
b=− 
30
1
​
 k
​
 .

similarly, from equation 3: 
a
c
=
−
1
3
k
ac=− 
3
1
​
 k.

substituting 
a
=
2
15
k
a=

​
 k
​
  and 
c
=
±

⋅
c
=

​

​
 ⋅c=−

so:

2

(

)
=

k
15
2
​
 k
​
 ⋅(±

​
 k
​
 )=− 
3

​
 k
compute the left side:

2

k

k
=

k
=

​
 
​
 ⋅k=

​
 
​
 ⋅k=

​
 k
therefore:

±
1
3
k
=
−
1
3
k
± 
3
1
​
 k=− 
3
1
​
 k
again, the positive root would give 
+
1
3
k
+ 
3

​
 k, which doesn't match, so 
c
c must be negative. thus, 
c
=
−
5
6
k
c=−

5
​
 k
​
 .

now, i have:

a
=
2
15
k
,
b
=
−
1
30
k
,
c
=
−
5

k
a=

​
 k
​
 ,b=− 
30

​
 k
​
 ,c=− 
6

​
 k
​
 
next, i can use equation 6: 
b
c
=

6
k
bc=

​
 k.

substituting 
b
b and 
c
c:

(

=

k
(−

​
 k
​
 )⋅(− 
6

​
 k
​
 )= 
6

​
 k
simplify the left side:

1

⋅

⋅
k
=

⋅
k
=

⋅

​
 
​
 ⋅k=

​
 
​
 ⋅k=

​
 
​
 ⋅k=

​
 k
so, this checks out.

now, i need to find the value of 
k
k. since 
k
=
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
k=a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 , and i have expressions for each in terms of 
k
k, let's plug them in:

k
=
2
15
k
+
1
30
k
+
5
6
k
k= 
15
2
​
 k+ 
30

​
 k+ 
6
5
​
 k
let's compute the right side:

2
15
k
+
1
30
k
+
5
6
k
15
2
​
 k+ 
30
1
​
 k+ 
6
5
​
 k
to add these fractions, i need a common denominator. the denominators are 15, 30, and 6. the least common multiple of 15, 30, and 6 is 30.

so, convert each fraction to have denominator 30:

2
15
k
=
4
30
k
,
1
30
k
=
1
30
k
,
5
6
k
=
25
30
k
15
2
​
 k= 
30
4
​
 k, 
30
1
​
 k= 
30
1
​
 k, 
6
5
​
 k= 
30
25
​
 k
now, add them up:

4
30
k
+
1
30
k
+
25
30
k
=
30
30
k
=
k
30
4
​
 k+ 
30
1
​
 k+ 
30
25
​
 k= 
30
30
​
 k=k
so, 
k
=
k
k=k, which doesn't give me new information. this suggests that the expressions are consistent, but i need another way to find 
k
k.

maybe i can use one of the earlier equations to solve for 
k
k. let's look back.

from equation 2: 
a
b
=
−
1
15
k
ab=− 
15
1
​
 k, and i have expressions for 
a
a and 
b
b in terms of 
k
k. but i already used that to determine the signs of 
b
b and 
c
c.

perhaps i can use the expressions for 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c in terms of 
k
k and express them as ratios.

let me define 
a
=
2
15
k
a= 
15
2
​
 
​
  
k
​
 , 
b
=
−

30
k
b=−

​
 
​
  
k
​
 , and 
c
=
−
5
6
k
c=− 
6
5
​
 
​
  
k
​
 .

then, the direction vector 
v
v is proportional to 
(
2
15
−
1
30
−
5
6
)
​
  
15
2
​
 
​
 
− 
30
1
​
 
​
 
− 
6
5
​
 
​
 
​
  
​
 .

wait a minute, perhaps i can find the ratios of 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c without worrying about 
k
k, since 
k
k is just a scaling factor.

let me consider the ratios:

a
c
=
2
15
−
5
6
=
−
2
15
⋅
6
5
=
−
12
75
=
−
4
25
=
−
2
5
c
a
​
 = 
− 
6

​
 
​

​
 
​
 
​
 =− 
15

​
 ⋅

​
 
​
 =− 
75
12
​
 
​
 =− 
25
4
​
 
​
 =− 
5
2
​
 
similarly, 
b
c
=
−
1
30
−
5
6
=
1
30
⋅
6
5
=
6
150
=

25
=

5
c
b
​
 = 
− 
6
5
​
 
​
 
− 
30
1
​
 
​
 
​
 = 
30
1
​
 ⋅ 
5
6
​
 
​
 = 
150
6
​
 
​
 = 
25
1
​
 
​
 = 
5

​
 

so, 
a
:
b
:
c
=
2
5
:
1
5
:
1
a:b:c= 
5
2
​
 : 
5
1
​
 :1, considering the signs.

but wait, 
a
a is positive, and both 
b
b and 
c
c are negative, according to earlier conclusions.

so, 
a
:
b
:
c
=
2
5
:
−
1
5
:
−
1
a:b:c= 
5
2
​
 :− 
5
1
​
 :−1

to make this simpler, i can multiply each component by 5 to eliminate denominators:

a
:
b
:
c
=
2
:
−
1
:
−
5
a:b:c=2:−1:−5

therefore, the direction vector could be 
(
2
−
1
−
5
)
​
  
2
−1
−5
​
  
​
 

but the problem states that 
a
>
0
a>0 and that the greatest common divisor of the absolute values of 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c is 1. in this case, 2, 1, and 5 are pairwise coprime, so their gcd is 1. also, 
a
=
2
>
0
a=2>0, which satisfies the condition.

let me check if this direction vector indeed corresponds to the given projection matrix.

first, compute 
v
v
t
vv

 :

(

=

​

​
  
​
 (

​
 )=

next, compute 
v

v

therefore, the projection matrix should be:

p

(

−

−

this matches the given projection matrix, so my direction vector is correct.

therefore, the direction vector of line

(

)
​
  
2

​
