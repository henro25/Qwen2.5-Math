Reasoning: So i have this problem: find the period of y = sin x + cos x. hmm, i know that both sine and cosine functions have a period of 2π, but since they're added together, i need to figure out if the sum has the same period or if it's different.

first, i recall that the period of a function is the smallest positive value p for which f(x + p) = f(x) for all x. so, i need to find the smallest p such that sin(x + p) + cos(x + p) = sin x + cos x.

let me think about the properties of sine and cosine. i know that sin(x + p) = sin x cos p + cos x sin p and cos(x + p) = cos x cos p - sin x sin p. so, if i add these together:

sin(x + p) + cos(x + p) = sin x cos p + cos x sin p + cos x cos p - sin x sin p

combining like terms:

= sin x (cos p - sin p) + cos x (sin p + cos p)

now, for this to equal sin x + cos x for all x, the coefficients of sin x and cos x must be equal on both sides. so:

cos p - sin p = 1 (for sin x terms)

sin p + cos p = 1 (for cos x terms)

now i have a system of equations:

1. cos p - sin p = 1

2. sin p + cos p = 1

hmm, maybe i can add these two equations:

(cos p - sin p) + (sin p + cos p) = 1 + 1

2 cos p = 2

cos p = 1

then, from cos p = 1, p = 2πk, where k is an integer.

but wait, i need the smallest positive p, so p = 2π.

but that seems too straightforward. let me check if there's a smaller period.

alternatively, maybe there's a better way to approach this. i remember that sin x + cos x can be rewritten using a phase shift formula.

i recall that a sin x + b cos x = c sin(x + d), where c = √(a² + b²) and d is some phase shift.

in this case, a = 1 and b = 1, so c = √(1 + 1) = √2.

so, sin x + cos x = √2 sin(x + d). to find d, tan d = b/a = 1/1 = 1, so d = π/4.

therefore, sin x + cos x = √2 sin(x + π/4).

now, the period of sin(x + π/4) is the same as sin x, which is 2π. so, the period of the sum should also be 2π.

but earlier, when i tried setting p = π, it didn't satisfy the equation. let me check that again.

if p = π, then sin(x + π) + cos(x + π) = -sin x - cos x, which is not equal to sin x + cos x unless sin x + cos x = 0, which isn't true for all x.

so, p = π doesn't work. what about p = π/2?

sin(x + π/2) + cos(x + π/2) = cos x - sin x, which is not equal to sin x + cos x, unless sin x + cos x = cos x - sin x, meaning sin x = 0, which again isn't true for all x.

okay, so p = π/2 also doesn't work.

what if p = π/4?

sin(x + π/4) + cos(x + π/4) = sin x cos(π/4) + cos x sin(π/4) + cos x cos(π/4) - sin x sin(π/4)

= sin x (√2/2 - √2/2) + cos x (√2/2 + √2/2)

= sin x (0) + cos x (√2)

= √2 cos x

that's not equal to sin x + cos x, so p = π/4 doesn't work.

it seems like p = 2π is indeed the smallest period that satisfies the equation for all x.

but i'm still a bit unsure. maybe there's another way to confirm this.

another approach: plot the function y = sin x + cos x and see its behavior.

i know that sin x and cos x are both periodic with period 2π, and their sum should also have a period that is a common multiple of their periods.

since both have period 2π, the sum should also have period 2π, unless there's some cancellation that reduces the period, but from my earlier checks with p = π and p = π/2, it doesn't seem like that's the case.

alternatively, consider the derivative of y = sin x + cos x, which is y' = cos x - sin x.

the period of y' should be the same as y if y has a period p.

but again, this doesn't directly help me find p.

maybe i can look at specific values.

for example, at x = 0:

y(0) = sin 0 + cos 0 = 0 + 1 = 1

at x = π/2:

y(π/2) = sin(π/2) + cos(π/2) = 1 + 0 = 1

at x = π:

y(π) = sin π + cos π = 0 - 1 = -1

at x = 3π/2:

y(3π/2) = sin(3π/2) + cos(3π/2) = -1 + 0 = -1

at x = 2π:

y(2π) = sin 2π + cos 2π = 0 + 1 = 1

so, from x = 0 to x = 2π, the function goes through a full cycle: 1, 1, -1, -1, 1.

if i check from x = 0 to x = π, the values are 1, 1, -1, which is only half of the cycle, and it doesn't repeat the same pattern immediately.

similarly, from x = π to x = 2π, it goes from -1 to -1 to 1, which mirrors the first half.

this suggests that the function completes a full cycle every 2π units.

moreover, considering the expression y = √2 sin(x + π/4), which has a period of 2π, reinforces that the period is indeed 2π.

i think i've convinced myself that the period of y = sin x + cos x is 2π.

**final answer**

2π
