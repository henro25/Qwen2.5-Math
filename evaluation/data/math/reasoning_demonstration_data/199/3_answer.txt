Answer: To solve the problem, we start by recalling that the sum of the interior angles of a convex pentagon is given by:

\[
(5-2) \times 180 = 540 \text{ degrees}
\]

the measures of the interior angles are five consecutive integers. let these angles be \( x, x+1, x+2, x+3, \) and \( x+4 \) degrees. the sum of these angles is:

\[
x + (x+1) + (x+2) + (x+3) + (x+4) = 540
\]

simplifying the equation:

\[
5x + 10 = 540
\]

subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[
5x = 530
\]

dividing by 5:

\[
x = 106
\]

thus, the angles are \( 106, 107, 108, 109, \) and \( 110 \) degrees. the largest angle is:

\[
\boxed{110}
\]
