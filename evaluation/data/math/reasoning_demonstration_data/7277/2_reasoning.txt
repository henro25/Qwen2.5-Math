Reasoning: So i've got this matrix to cube, right? the matrix is 
(
1
−
1
1
0
 
)
( 
1
1
​	
  
−1
0
​	
 ), and i need to compute its cube. hmm, matrices can be a bit tricky, especially when you have to raise them to a power. i remember that to find the cube of a matrix, you can multiply the matrix by itself three times. so, essentially, i need to compute 
a
3
=
a
×
a
×
a
a 
3
 =a×a×a, where 
a
=
(
1
−
1
1
0
 
)
a=( 
1
1
​	
  
−1
0
​	
 ).

first, i should probably find 
a
2
a 
2
 , which is 
a
×
a
a×a, and then multiply that result by 
a
a again to get 
a
3
a 
3
 . let me recall how to multiply two matrices. when multiplying matrices, you take the dot product of the rows of the first matrix with the columns of the second matrix.

so, let's compute 
a
2
a 
2
 :

a
=
(
1
−
1
1
0
 
)
a=( 
1
1
​	
  
−1
0
​	
 )

a
2
=
a
×
a
=
(
1
−
1
1
0
 
)
×
(
1
−
1
1
0
 
)
a 
2
 =a×a=( 
1
1
​	
  
−1
0
​	
 )×( 
1
1
​	
  
−1
0
​	
 )

to compute the element in the first row and first column of 
a
2
a 
2
 , i take the dot product of the first row of the first matrix and the first column of the second matrix:

1
×
1
+
(
−
1
)
×
1
=
1
−
1
=
0
1×1+(−1)×1=1−1=0

for the first row and second column:

1
×
(
−
1
)
+
(
−
1
)
×
0
=
−
1
+
0
=
−
1
1×(−1)+(−1)×0=−1+0=−1

for the second row and first column:

1
×
1
+
0
×
1
=
1
+
0
=
1
1×1+0×1=1+0=1

and for the second row and second column:

1
×
(
−
1
)
+
0
×
0
=
−
1
+
0
=
−
1
1×(−1)+0×0=−1+0=−1

so, 
a
2
=
(
0
−
1
1
−
1
 
)
a 
2
 =( 
0
1
​	
  
−1
−1
​	
 )

now, i need to find 
a
3
=
a
2
×
a
a 
3
 =a 
2
 ×a:

a
2
=
(
0
−
1
1
−
1
 
)
a 
2
 =( 
0
1
​	
  
−1
−1
​	
 )

a
=
(
1
−
1
1
0
 
)
a=( 
1
1
​	
  
−1
0
​	
 )

again, i'll compute the dot products for each position:

first row, first column:

0
×
1
+
(
−
1
)
×
1
=
0
−
1
=
−
1
0×1+(−1)×1=0−1=−1

first row, second column:

0
×
(
−
1
)
+
(
−
1
)
×
0
=
0
+
0
=
0
0×(−1)+(−1)×0=0+0=0

second row, first column:

1
×
1
+
(
−
1
)
×
1
=
1
−
1
=
0
1×1+(−1)×1=1−1=0

second row, second column:

1
×
(
−
1
)
+
(
−
1
)
×
0
=
−
1
+
0
=
−
1
1×(−1)+(−1)×0=−1+0=−1

so, 
a
3
=
(
−
1
0
0
−
1
 
)
a 
3
 =( 
−1
0
​	
  
0
−1
​	
 )

wait a minute, that seems interesting. the result is a diagonal matrix with -1 on the diagonal. is there a pattern here? maybe i can check if there's a simpler way to find higher powers of this matrix.

let me see if there's a pattern in the powers of 
a
a. i have 
a
1
=
a
=
(
1
−
1
1
0
 
)
a 
1
 =a=( 
1
1
​	
  
−1
0
​	
 ), 
a
2
=
(
0
−
1
1
−
1
 
)
a 
2
 =( 
0
1
​	
  
−1
−1
​	
 ), and 
a
3
=
(
−
1
0
0
−
1
 
)
a 
3
 =( 
−1
0
​	
  
0
−1
​	
 ).

hmm, 
a
3
a 
3
  looks like 
−
i
−i, where 
i
i is the identity matrix. let's see:

−
i
=
(
−
1
0
0
−
1
 
)
−i=( 
−1
0
​	
  
0
−1
​	
 ), which matches 
a
3
a 
3
 . so, 
a
3
=
−
i
a 
3
 =−i.

is there a way to generalize this? maybe find a pattern or a formula for higher powers of 
a
a. but for now, since the problem only asks for 
a
3
a 
3
 , i think i've got the answer.

just to make sure i didn't make any calculation errors, i'll double-check my multiplication steps.

first, computing 
a
2
a 
2
 :

a
×
a
=
(
1
−
1
1
0
 
)
×
(
1
−
1
1
0
 
)
a×a=( 
1
1
​	
  
−1
0
​	
 )×( 
1
1
​	
  
−1
0
​	
 )

first row, first column: 
1
∗
1
+
(
−
1
)
∗
1
=
1
−
1
=
0
1∗1+(−1)∗1=1−1=0 ✅

first row, second column: 
1
∗
(
−
1
)
+
(
−
1
)
∗
0
=
−
1
+
0
=
−
1
1∗(−1)+(−1)∗0=−1+0=−1 ✅

second row, first column: 
1
∗
1
+
0
∗
1
=
1
+
0
=
1
1∗1+0∗1=1+0=1 ✅

second row, second column: 
1
∗
(
−
1
)
+
0
∗
0
=
−
1
+
0
=
−
1
1∗(−1)+0∗0=−1+0=−1 ✅

so, 
a
2
=
(
0
−
1
1
−
1
 
)
a 
2
 =( 
0
1
​	
  
−1
−1
​	
 ) is correct.

now, 
a
2
×
a
=
(
0
−
1
1
−
1
 
)
×
(
1
−
1
1
0
 
)
a 
2
 ×a=( 
0
1
​	
  
−1
−1
​	
 )×( 
1
1
​	
  
−1
0
​	
 )

first row, first column: 
0
∗
1
+
(
−
1
)
∗
1
=
0
−
1
=
−
1
0∗1+(−1)∗1=0−1=−1 ✅

first row, second column: 
0
∗
(
−
1
)
+
(
−
1
)
∗
0
=
0
+
0
=
0
0∗(−1)+(−1)∗0=0+0=0 ✅

second row, first column: 
1
∗
1
+
(
−
1
)
∗
1
=
1
−
1
=
0
1∗1+(−1)∗1=1−1=0 ✅

second row, second column: 
1
∗
(
−
1
)
+
(
−
1
)
∗
0
=
−
1
+
0
=
−
1
1∗(−1)+(−1)∗0=−1+0=−1 ✅

so, 
a
3
=
(
−
1
0
0
−
1
 
)
a 
3
 =( 
−1
0
​	
  
0
−1
​	
 ) is indeed correct.

alternatively, i could have noticed that 
a
3
=
−
i
a 
3
 =−i, which might hint at the minimal polynomial or eigenvalues, but that's probably beyond the scope of this problem. for now, just confirming the calculation suffices.

therefore, the final answer is 
(
−
1
0
0
−
1
 
)
( 
−1
0
​	
  
0
−1
​	
 )
​	
 .

**final answer**

(
−
1
0
0
−
1
 
)
