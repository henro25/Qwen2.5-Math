Answer: Given the seventh and tenth terms of a geometric sequence are 7 and 21, respectively, we need to find the 13th term.

first, we use the general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence:

\[ a_n = a_1 \times r^{n-1} \]

for the seventh term:

\[ a_7 = a_1 \times r^6 = 7 \]

for the tenth term:

\[ a_{10} = a_1 \times r^9 = 21 \]

dividing the equation for \( a_{10} \) by \( a_7 \):

\[ \frac{a_{10}}{a_7} = \frac{a_1 \times r^9}{a_1 \times r^6} = \frac{21}{7} \]

this simplifies to:

\[ r^3 = 3 \]

thus, the common ratio \( r \) is:

\[ r = \sqrt[3]{3} \]

next, we solve for \( a_1 \) using the equation for \( a_7 \):

\[ a_1 \times (\sqrt[3]{3})^6 = 7 \]

since \( (\sqrt[3]{3})^6 = 9 \):

\[ a_1 \times 9 = 7 \]

so:

\[ a_1 = \frac{7}{9} \]

now, we find the 13th term:

\[ a_{13} = a_1 \times r^{12} \]

substituting the known values:

\[ a_{13} = \frac{7}{9} \times (\sqrt[3]{3})^{12} \]

since \( (\sqrt[3]{3})^{12} = 81 \):

\[ a_{13} = \frac{7}{9} \times 81 = 7 \times 9 = 63 \]

therefore, the 13th term is:

\[
\boxed{63}
\]
