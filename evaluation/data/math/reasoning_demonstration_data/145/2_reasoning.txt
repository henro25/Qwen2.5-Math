Reasoning: So i've got this problem here about a geometric sequence. it says that the seventh term is 7 and the tenth term is 21, and i need to find the thirteenth term. hmm, geometric sequences have a common ratio between terms, right? so, each term is multiplied by this ratio to get the next term.

let me recall the general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence. it's usually written as:

a
n
=
a
1
×
r
n
−
1
a 
n
​
 =a 
1
​
 ×r 
n−1
 
where 
a
n
a 
n
​
  is the nth term, 
a
1
a 
1
​
  is the first term, and 
r
r is the common ratio.

but in this problem, i don't have the first term or the common ratio; instead, i have the seventh and tenth terms. maybe i can set up equations based on these.

so, the seventh term is:

a
7
=
a
1
×
r
6
=
7
a 
7
​
 =a 
1
​
 ×r 
6
 =7
and the tenth term is:

a
10
=
a
1
×
r
9
=
21
a 
10
​
 =a 
1
​
 ×r 
9
 =21
now, i have two equations with two unknowns: 
a
1
a 
1
​
  and 
r
r. maybe i can divide one equation by the other to eliminate 
a
1
a 
1
​
 .

let's divide 
a
10
a 
10
​
  by 
a
7
a 
7
​
 :

a
10
a
7
=
a
1
×
r
9
a
1
×
r
6
=
21
7
a 
7
​
 
a 
10
​
 
​
 = 
a 
1
​
 ×r 
6
 
a 
1
​
 ×r 
9
 
​
 = 
7
21
​
 
simplifying the left side:

a
1
×
r
9
a
1
×
r
6
=
r
9
−
6
=
r
3
a 
1
​
 ×r 
6
 
a 
1
​
 ×r 
9
 
​
 =r 
9−6
 =r 
3
 
and the right side is:

21
7
=
3
7
21
​
 =3
so, 
r
3
=
3
r 
3
 =3. to find 
r
r, i can take the cube root of both sides:

r
=
3
3
r= 
3
  
3
​
 
alright, now that i have 
r
r, i can plug it back into one of the original equations to find 
a
1
a 
1
​
 . let's use the equation for 
a
7
a 
7
​
 :

a
1
×
(
3
3
)
6
=
7
a 
1
​
 ×( 
3
  
3
​
 ) 
6
 =7
first, simplify 
(
3
3
)
6
( 
3
  
3
​
 ) 
6
 . since 
(
3
3
)
3
=
3
( 
3
  
3
​
 ) 
3
 =3, then 
(
3
3
)
6
=
(
(
3
3
)
3
)
2
=
3
2
=
9
( 
3
  
3
​
 ) 
6
 =(( 
3
  
3
​
 ) 
3
 ) 
2
 =3 
2
 =9.

so now the equation is:

a
1
×
9
=
7
a 
1
​
 ×9=7
therefore, 
a
1
=
7
9
a 
1
​
 = 
9
7
​
 .

now, i need to find the thirteenth term, 
a
13
a 
13
​
 :

a
13
=
a
1
×
r
12
a 
13
​
 =a 
1
​
 ×r 
12
 
substituting the known values:

a
13
=
7
9
×
(
3
3
)
12
a 
13
​
 = 
9
7
​
 ×( 
3
  
3
​
 ) 
12
 
again, simplify 
(
3
3
)
12
( 
3
  
3
​
 ) 
12
 . since 
(
3
3
)
3
=
3
( 
3
  
3
​
 ) 
3
 =3, then 
(
3
3
)
12
=
(
(
3
3
)
3
)
4
=
3
4
=
81
( 
3
  
3
​
 ) 
12
 =(( 
3
  
3
​
 ) 
3
 ) 
4
 =3 
4
 =81.

so:

a
13
=
7
9
×
81
a 
13
​
 = 
9
7
​
 ×81
simplify 
7
9
×
81
9
7
​
 ×81:

7
9
×
81
=
7
×
81
9
=
7
×
9
=
63
9
7
​
 ×81=7× 
9
81
​
 =7×9=63
therefore, the thirteenth term is 63.

wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

first, i found 
r
3
=
3
r 
3
 =3, so 
r
=
3
3
r= 
3
  
3
​
 . that seems correct.

then, i found 
a
1
=
7
9
a 
1
​
 = 
9
7
​
 , and for 
a
13
a 
13
​
 , i calculated 
(
3
3
)
12
=
81
( 
3
  
3
​
 ) 
12
 =81, which seems right because 
(
3
3
)
3
=
3
( 
3
  
3
​
 ) 
3
 =3, and raising that to the 4th power gives 81.

then, 
7
9
×
81
=
7
×
9
=
63
9
7
​
 ×81=7×9=63. that checks out.

i think that's the correct answer.

**final answer**

63
63
