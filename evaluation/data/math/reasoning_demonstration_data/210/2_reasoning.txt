Reasoning: So i have this problem here: there are four points that are 5 units away from the line y = 13 and 13 units away from the point (7,13). i need to find the sum of the x and y coordinates of all four of these points. hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

first, i need to understand what it means for a point to be a certain distance from a line and from another point. let's tackle the distance from the line y = 13 first. the distance from a point (x, y) to the line y = 13 is given by the formula for the distance from a point to a horizontal line, which is just the absolute difference in the y-coordinates. so, the distance from (x, y) to y = 13 is |y - 13|. according to the problem, this distance should be 5 units. that means:

|y - 13| = 5

this equation implies two possibilities:

1. y - 13 = 5 ⇒ y = 18

2. y - 13 = -5 ⇒ y = 8

so, any point that is 5 units away from the line y = 13 must have a y-coordinate of either 18 or 8.

next, these points also need to be 13 units away from the point (7,13). the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the distance formula:

distance = √[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²]

in this case, the distance from (x, y) to (7,13) should be 13 units. so, plugging in the values:

√[(x - 7)² + (y - 13)²] = 13

since we already know that y is either 18 or 8, i can substitute these values into the equation and solve for x.

first, let's consider y = 18:

√[(x - 7)² + (18 - 13)²] = 13

√[(x - 7)² + (5)²] = 13

√[(x - 7)² + 25] = 13

now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(x - 7)² + 25 = 169

subtract 25 from both sides:

(x - 7)² = 144

take the square root of both sides:

x - 7 = ±12

so, x = 7 + 12 = 19 or x = 7 - 12 = -5

therefore, when y = 18, the x-coordinates are 19 and -5, giving us the points (19, 18) and (-5, 18).

next, let's consider y = 8:

√[(x - 7)² + (8 - 13)²] = 13

√[(x - 7)² + (-5)²] = 13

√[(x - 7)² + 25] = 13

again, square both sides:

(x - 7)² + 25 = 169

subtract 25 from both sides:

(x - 7)² = 144

take the square root of both sides:

x - 7 = ±12

so, x = 7 + 12 = 19 or x = 7 - 12 = -5

therefore, when y = 8, the x-coordinates are again 19 and -5, giving us the points (19, 8) and (-5, 8).

now, i have all four points:

1. (19, 18)

2. (-5, 18)

3. (19, 8)

4. (-5, 8)

the problem asks for the sum of the x- and y-coordinates of all four points. so, i need to add up all the x-coordinates and all the y-coordinates and then sum those two totals.

let's calculate the sum of the x-coordinates:

19 + (-5) + 19 + (-5) = 19 - 5 + 19 - 5 = 14 + 14 = 28

now, the sum of the y-coordinates:

18 + 18 + 8 + 8 = 36 + 16 = 52

finally, the sum of all x and y coordinates is:

28 + 52 = 80

so, the sum of the x- and y-coordinates of all four points is 80.

**final answer**

80
80
