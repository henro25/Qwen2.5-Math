Answer: First, we determine the y-coordinates of the points that are 5 units away from the line \( y = 13 \):

\[
|y - 13| = 5 \implies y = 18 \text{ or } y = 8
\]

next, we find the x-coordinates of the points that are 13 units away from the point \( (7, 13) \) for each y-coordinate.

for \( y = 18 \):

\[
\sqrt{(x - 7)^2 + (18 - 13)^2} = 13 \implies \sqrt{(x - 7)^2 + 25} = 13
\]
\[
(x - 7)^2 + 25 = 169 \implies (x - 7)^2 = 144 \implies x - 7 = \pm 12 \implies x = 19 \text{ or } x = -5
\]

thus, the points are \( (19, 18) \) and \( (-5, 18) \).

for \( y = 8 \):

\[
\sqrt{(x - 7)^2 + (8 - 13)^2} = 13 \implies \sqrt{(x - 7)^2 + 25} = 13
\]
\[
(x - 7)^2 + 25 = 169 \implies (x - 7)^2 = 144 \implies x - 7 = \pm 12 \implies x = 19 \text{ or } x = -5
\]

thus, the points are \( (19, 8) \) and \( (-5, 8) \).

the four points are \( (19, 18) \), \( (-5, 18) \), \( (19, 8) \), and \( (-5, 8) \).

sum of the x-coordinates:

\[
19 + (-5) + 19 + (-5) = 28
\]

sum of the y-coordinates:

\[
18 + 18 + 8 + 8 = 52
\]

total sum of the x- and y-coordinates:

\[
28 + 52 = 80
\]

\[
\boxed{80}
\]
