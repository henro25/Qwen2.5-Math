Answer: To find the maximum value of \( f(x) \), where \( f(x) \) is defined as the minimum of the three functions \( 2x + 2 \), \( \frac{1}{2}x + 1 \), and \( -\frac{3}{4}x + 7 \), we need to determine the points where these functions intersect and analyze the behavior of \( f(x) \) in the intervals defined by these points.

first, we find the intersection points of the functions:

1. intersection of \( 2x + 2 \) and \( \frac{1}{2}x + 1 \):
   \[
   2x + 2 = \frac{1}{2}x + 1 \implies \frac{3}{2}x = -1 \implies x = -\frac{2}{3}
   \]

2. intersection of \( 2x + 2 \) and \( -\frac{3}{4}x + 7 \):
   \[
   2x + 2 = -\frac{3}{4}x + 7 \implies \frac{11}{4}x = 5 \implies x = \frac{20}{11}
   \]

3. intersection of \( \frac{1}{2}x + 1 \) and \( -\frac{3}{4}x + 7 \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}x + 1 = -\frac{3}{4}x + 7 \implies \frac{5}{4}x = 6 \implies x = \frac{24}{5}
   \]

these points divide the real line into intervals. we analyze \( f(x) \) in each interval:

1. for \( x < -\frac{2}{3} \), \( f(x) = 2x + 2 \).
2. for \( -\frac{2}{3} \leq x < \frac{24}{5} \), \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x + 1 \).
3. for \( x \geq \frac{24}{5} \), \( f(x) = -\frac{3}{4}x + 7 \).

we evaluate \( f(x) \) at the critical points:

1. at \( x = -\frac{2}{3} \):
   \[
   f\left(-\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\left(-\frac{2}{3}\right) + 1 = \frac{2}{3}
   \]

2. at \( x = \frac{24}{5} \):
   \[
   f\left(\frac{24}{5}\right) = -\frac{3}{4}\left(\frac{24}{5}\right) + 7 = 3.4
   \]

since \( f(x) \) is increasing in the intervals \( x < -\frac{2}{3} \) and \( -\frac{2}{3} \leq x < \frac{24}{5} \), and decreasing in \( x \geq \frac{24}{5} \), the maximum value of \( f(x) \) is at \( x = \frac{24}{5} \).

thus, the maximum value of \( f(x) \) is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{17}{5}}
\]
