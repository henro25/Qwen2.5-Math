Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: for each value of 
x
x, 
f
(
x
)
f(x) is defined to be the minimum of three numbers: 
2
x
+
2
2x+2, 
1
2
x
+
1
2
1
​	
 x+1, and 
−
3
4
x
+
7
− 
4
3
​	
 x+7. and i need to find the maximum value of 
f
(
x
)
f(x).

okay, so first things first, i need to understand what 
f
(
x
)
f(x) represents. it's the smallest of these three linear functions at any given 
x
x. so, for each 
x
x, i plug it into these three expressions and pick the smallest one, and that's 
f
(
x
)
f(x). now, i need to find the maximum of all these minima.

hmm, that sounds a bit tricky. maybe i should graph these three functions to get a better visual understanding. let me try to sketch them out.

first, 
y
=
2
x
+
2
y=2x+2. that's a straight line with a slope of 2 and a y-intercept at (0,2).

second, 
y
=
1
2
x
+
1
y= 
2
1
​	
 x+1. this is another straight line, but with a gentler slope of 0.5 and a y-intercept at (0,1).

third, 
y
=
−
3
4
x
+
7
y=− 
4
3
​	
 x+7. this line has a negative slope of -0.75 and a y-intercept at (0,7).

alright, plotting these on a graph, i can see that they intersect each other at certain points. the function 
f
(
x
)
f(x) will switch which of these three lines it's taking the minimum from at these intersection points.

so, to find where these lines intersect, i need to set them equal to each other and solve for 
x
x.

let's find the intersection points:

1. intersection of 
2
x
+
2
2x+2 and 
1
2
x
+
1
2
1
​	
 x+1:

set 
2
x
+
2
=
1
2
x
+
1
2x+2= 
2
1
​	
 x+1.

subtract 
1
2
x
2
1
​	
 x from both sides: 
3
2
x
+
2
=
1
2
3
​	
 x+2=1.

subtract 2: 
3
2
x
=
−
1
2
3
​	
 x=−1.

multiply by 
2
3
3
2
​	
 : 
x
=
−
2
3
x=− 
3
2
​	
 .

so, they intersect at 
x
=
−
2
3
x=− 
3
2
​	
 .

2. intersection of 
2
x
+
2
2x+2 and 
−
3
4
x
+
7
− 
4
3
​	
 x+7:

set 
2
x
+
2
=
−
3
4
x
+
7
2x+2=− 
4
3
​	
 x+7.

add 
3
4
x
4
3
​	
 x to both sides: 
2
x
+
3
4
x
+
2
=
7
2x+ 
4
3
​	
 x+2=7.

combine like terms: 
11
4
x
+
2
=
7
4
11
​	
 x+2=7.

subtract 2: 
11
4
x
=
5
4
11
​	
 x=5.

multiply by 
4
11
11
4
​	
 : 
x
=
20
11
x= 
11
20
​	
 .

so, they intersect at 
x
=
20
11
x= 
11
20
​	
 .

3. intersection of 
1
2
x
+
1
2
1
​	
 x+1 and 
−
3
4
x
+
7
− 
4
3
​	
 x+7:

set 
1
2
x
+
1
=
−
3
4
x
+
7
2
1
​	
 x+1=− 
4
3
​	
 x+7.

add 
3
4
x
4
3
​	
 x to both sides: 
5
4
x
+
1
=
7
4
5
​	
 x+1=7.

subtract 1: 
5
4
x
=
6
4
5
​	
 x=6.

multiply by 
4
5
5
4
​	
 : 
x
=
24
5
x= 
5
24
​	
 .

so, they intersect at 
x
=
24
5
x= 
5
24
​	
 .

now, these intersection points divide the real line into intervals where one of the three functions is the minimum.

let's list the critical points in order: 
x
=
−
2
3
x=− 
3
2
​	
 , 
x
=
20
11
x= 
11
20
​	
 , and 
x
=
24
5
x= 
5
24
​	
 .

so, the intervals are:

1. 
x
<
−
2
3
x<− 
3
2
​	
 

2. 
−
2
3
≤
x
<
20
11
− 
3
2
​	
 ≤x< 
11
20
​	
 

3. 
20
11
≤
x
<
24
5
11
20
​	
 ≤x< 
5
24
​	
 

4. 
x
≥
24
5
x≥ 
5
24
​	
 

in each of these intervals, one of the three functions will be the minimum.

i need to determine which function is the minimum in each interval.

let's consider each interval one by one.

**interval 1: 
x
<
−
2
3
x<− 
3
2
​	
 **

pick a test point, say 
x
=
−
1
x=−1.

calculate each function:

2
(
−
1
)
+
2
=
0
2(−1)+2=0

1
2
(
−
1
)
+
1
=
0.5
2
1
​	
 (−1)+1=0.5

−
3
4
(
−
1
)
+
7
=
0.75
+
7
=
7.75
− 
4
3
​	
 (−1)+7=0.75+7=7.75

so, the minimum is 0 from 
2
x
+
2
2x+2.

therefore, in this interval, 
f
(
x
)
=
2
x
+
2
f(x)=2x+2.

**interval 2: 
−
2
3
≤
x
<
20
11
− 
3
2
​	
 ≤x< 
11
20
​	
 **

pick a test point, say 
x
=
0
x=0.

calculate each function:

2
(
0
)
+
2
=
2
2(0)+2=2

1
2
(
0
)
+
1
=
1
2
1
​	
 (0)+1=1

−
3
4
(
0
)
+
7
=
7
− 
4
3
​	
 (0)+7=7

so, the minimum is 1 from 
1
2
x
+
1
2
1
​	
 x+1.

therefore, in this interval, 
f
(
x
)
=
1
2
x
+
1
f(x)= 
2
1
​	
 x+1.

**interval 3: 
20
11
≤
x
<
24
5
11
20
​	
 ≤x< 
5
24
​	
 **

pick a test point, say 
x
=
2
x=2.

calculate each function:

2
(
2
)
+
2
=
6
2(2)+2=6

1
2
(
2
)
+
1
=
2
2
1
​	
 (2)+1=2

−
3
4
(
2
)
+
7
=
−
1.5
+
7
=
5.5
− 
4
3
​	
 (2)+7=−1.5+7=5.5

so, the minimum is 2 from 
1
2
x
+
1
2
1
​	
 x+1.

wait a minute, but at 
x
=
20
11
x= 
11
20
​	
 , which is approximately 1.818, let's see what happens.

at 
x
=
20
11
x= 
11
20
​	
 :

2
x
+
2
=
2
∗
20
11
+
2
=
40
11
+
22

=

≈
5.636
2x+2=2∗ 
11

​	
 +2=

​	
 +

​	
 =

​	
 ≈5.636

1
2
x

=

2
∗

=

=

≈

​	
 x+1=

−

=
−

11
=

≈
5.636
−

​	
 x+7=−

11
15
​	
 +7= 
11
−15+77
​	
 = 
11
62
​	
 ≈5.636

so, at 
x
=
20
11
x= 
11
20
​	
 , both 
2
x
+
2
2x+2 and 
−
3
4
x
+
7
− 
4
3
​	
 x+7 are equal to approximately 5.636, and 
1
2
x
+
1
2
1
​	
 x+1 is approximately 1.909, which is smaller. so, the minimum is still 
1
2
x
+
1
2
1
​	
 x+1.

wait, but when i picked 
x
=
2
x=2, i got 
1
2
x
+
1
=
2
2
1
​	
 x+1=2, and 
−
3
4
x
+
7
=
5.5
− 
4
3
​	
 x+7=5.5, so 2 is still the minimum.

but let's check at 
x
=
24
5
=
4.8
x= 
5
24
​	
 =4.8:

2
x
+
2
=
2
∗
4.8
+
2
=
9.6
+
2
=
11.6
2x+2=2∗4.8+2=9.6+2=11.6

1
2
x

=

=

​	
 x+1=

​	
 ∗4.8+1=2.4+1=3.4

−
3

x

=

3
4
∗
4.8

7
=
−
3.6

7
=
3.4
− 
4
3
​	
 x+7=− 
4
3
​	
 ∗4.8+7=−3.6+7=3.4

so, at 
x
=
24
5
x= 
5
24
​	
 , both 
1
2
x
+
1
2
1
​	
 x+1 and 
−
3
4
x
+
7
− 
4
3
​	
 x+7 are equal to 3.4, and 
2
x
+
2
=
11.6
2x+2=11.6. so, the minimum is 3.4.

therefore, in the interval 
20
11
≤
x
<
24
5
11
20
​	
 ≤x< 
5
24
​	
 , 
f
(
x
)
f(x) transitions from 
1
2
x
+
1
2
1
​	
 x+1 to 
−
3
4
x
+
7
−

3
​	
 x+7. i need to find where 
1
2
x
+
1
2
1
​	
 x+1 and 
−
3
4
x
+
7
− 
4
3
​	
 x+7 intersect, which we already did at 
x
=
24
5
x= 
5
24
​	
 .

so, in this interval, 
1
2
x
+
1
2
1
​	
 x+1 is still the minimum until 
x
=
24
5
x= 
5
24
​	
 , where both 
1
2
x
+
1
2
1
​	
 x+1 and 
−
3
4
x
+
7
− 
4
3
​	
 x+7 are equal.

wait, but at 
x
=
20
11
x= 
11
20
​	
 , 
1
2
x
+
1
2
1
​	
 x+1 is still smaller than the other two functions, and it remains smaller until 
x
=
24
5
x= 
5
24
​	
 , where it equals the third function.

so, in this interval, 
f
(
x
)
=
1
2
x
+
1
f(x)= 
2
1
​	
 x+1, and at 
x
=
24
5
x= 
5
24
​	
 , it starts to be equal to 
−
3
4
x
+
7
− 
4
3
​	
 x+7.

**interval 4: 
x
≥
24
5
x≥ 
5
24
​	
 **

pick a test point, say 
x
=
5
x=5.

calculate each function:

2
(
5
)
+
2
=
12
2(5)+2=12

1
2
(
5
)
+
1
=
2.5
+
1
=
3.5
2
1
​	
 (5)+1=2.5+1=3.5

−
3
4
(
5
)
+
7
=
−
3.75
+
7
=
3.25
− 
4
3
​	
 (5)+7=−3.75+7=3.25

so, the minimum is 3.25 from 
−
3
4
x
+
7
− 
4
3
​	
 x+7.

therefore, in this interval, 
f
(
x
)
=
−
3
4
x
+
7
f(x)=− 
4
3
​	
 x+7.

alright, now i have 
f
(
x
)
f(x) defined piecewise:

- for 
x
<
−
2
3
x<− 
3
2
​	
 , 
f
(
x
)
=
2
x
+
2
f(x)=2x+2

- for 
−
2
3
≤
x
<
24
5
− 
3
2
​	
 ≤x< 
5
24
​	
 , 
f
(
x
)
=
1
2
x
+
1
f(x)= 
2
1
​	
 x+1

- for 
x
≥
24
5
x≥ 
5
24
​	
 , 
f
(
x
)
=
−
3
4
x
+
7
f(x)=− 
4
3
​	
 x+7

wait, but earlier, i thought in 
20
11
≤
x
<
24
5
11
20
​	
 ≤x< 
5
24
​	
 , 
f
(
x
)
=
1
2
x
+
1
f(x)= 
2
1
​	
 x+1, and at 
x
=
24
5
x= 
5
24
​	
 , it equals 
−
3
4
x
+
7
− 
4
3
​	
 x+7, so for 
x
>
24
5
x> 
5
24
​	
 , 
f
(
x
)
=
−
3
4
x
+
7
f(x)=− 
4
3
​	
 x+7.

so, perhaps i should adjust the intervals accordingly.

let me summarize:

- for 
x
<
−
2
3
x<− 
3
2
​	
 , 
f
(
x
)
=
2
x
+
2
f(x)=2x+2

- for 
−
2
3
≤
x
<
24
5
− 
3
2
​	
 ≤x< 
5
24
​	
 , 
f
(
x
)
=
1
2
x
+
1
f(x)= 
2
1
​	
 x+1

- for 
x
≥
24
5
x≥ 
5
24
​	
 , 
f
(
x
)
=
−
3
4
x
+
7
f(x)=− 
4
3
​	
 x+7

now, to find the maximum value of 
f
(
x
)
f(x), i need to look at the maximum of these piecewise functions.

since 
f
(
x
)
f(x) is continuous and changes its expression at the critical points, the maximum should occur either at one of these critical points or where the function changes its behavior.

let's evaluate 
f
(
x
)
f(x) at the critical points:

1. at 
x
=
−
2
3
x=− 
3
2
​	
 :

f
(
−
2
3
)
=
1
2
(
−
2
3
)
+
1
=
−
1
3
+
1
=
2
3
f(− 
3
2
​	
 )= 
2
1
​	
 (− 
3
2
​	
 )+1=− 
3
1
​	
 +1= 
3
2
​	
 

2. at 
x
=
24
5
x= 
5
24
​	
 :

f
(
24
5
)
=
−
3
4
(
24
5
)
+
7
=
−
18
5
+
7
=
−
3.6
+
7
=
3.4
f( 
5
24
​	
 )=− 
4
3
​	
 ( 
5
24
​	
 )+7=− 
5
18
​	
 +7=−3.6+7=3.4

also, i should check the behavior of 
f
(
x
)
f(x) as 
x
x approaches positive and negative infinity.

for 
x
→
−
∞
x→−∞, 
f
(
x
)
=
2
x
+
2
f(x)=2x+2, which goes to 
−
∞
−∞.

for 
x
→
+
∞
x→+∞, 
f
(
x
)
=
−
3
4
x
+
7
f(x)=− 
4
3
​	
 x+7, which goes to 
−
∞
−∞.

so, the function decreases to 
−
∞
−∞ on both ends.

therefore, the maximum must occur somewhere in the middle.

now, since 
f
(
x
)
f(x) is increasing or decreasing in each interval, i should check if there are any local maxima within the intervals.

let's look at each piece:

1. 
f
(
x
)
=
2
x
+
2
f(x)=2x+2 for 
x
<
−
2
3
x<− 
3

 : this is a straight line with positive slope, so it's increasing. therefore, its maximum in this interval is approached as 
x
x approaches

  from the left, which is 
f
(
−

=

f(−

​	
 ≤x< 
5
24
​	
 : this is also a straight line with positive slope, so it's increasing. its maximum in this interval is at 
x
=
24
5
x= 
5
24
​	
 , which is 
f
(
24
5
)
=
3.4
f(

 )=3.4.

 x+7 for 
x
≥

x≥

 : this is a straight line with negative slope, so it's decreasing. its maximum in this interval is at

x=

​	
 , which is again 
f
(
24
5
)
=
3.4
f(

 )=3.4.

therefore, the maximum value of 
f
(

f(x) is 
3.4
3.4, which occurs at 
x
=
24

x=

​	
 .

but to be thorough, i should confirm that there are no higher values in between or elsewhere.

let me consider the behavior in each interval again.

in the first interval, 
x
<
−
2
3
x<− 
3
2
​	
 , 
f
(
x
)
=
2
x
+
2
f(x)=2x+2, which increases to 
2
3
3
2
​	
  as 
x
x approaches 
−
2
3
− 
3
2
​	
 .

in the second interval, 
−
2
3
≤
x
<
24
5
− 
3
2
​	
 ≤x< 
5
24
​	
 , 
f
(
x
)
=
1
2
x
+
1
f(x)= 
2
1
​	
 x+1, which increases to 
3.4
3.4 at 
x
=
24
5
x= 
5
24
​	
 .

in the third interval, 
x
≥
24
5
x≥ 
5
24
​	
 , 
f
(
x
)
=
−
3
4
x
+
7
f(x)=− 
4
3
​	
 x+7, which decreases from 
3.4
3.4 as 
x
x increases.

so, indeed, the maximum value of 
f
(
x
)
f(x) is 
3.4
3.4, achieved at 
x
=
24
5
x= 
5
24
​	
 .

but to express it as a fraction, 
3.4
=
17
5
3.4= 
5
17
​	
 .

therefore, the maximum value of 
f
(
x
)
f(x) is 
17
5
5
17
​	
 .
