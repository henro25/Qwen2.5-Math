Reasoning: So i have this problem here: i need to find the determinant of a 2x2 matrix that corresponds to a dilation centered at the origin with a scale factor of 7. hmm, okay, let's break this down.

first, i need to understand what a dilation matrix is. dilation is a kind of transformation that enlarges or reduces objects by a certain scale factor from a fixed point, which in this case is the origin. so, if i have a point (x, y), after dilation with a scale factor of 7, it should become (7x, 7y).

now, in matrix terms, a dilation centered at the origin can be represented by a matrix that, when multiplied by a vector (x, y), gives me (7x, 7y). so, the matrix should look something like this:

d
=
(
7
0
0
7
 
)
d=( 
7
0
​	
  
0
7
​	
 )
wait, does that make sense? let me check by multiplying it with a vector:

d
(
x
y
 
)
=
(
7
x
7
y
 
)
d( 
x
y
​	
 )=( 
7x
7y
​	
 )
yes, that seems correct. so, the matrix 
d
d is indeed:

d
=
(
7
0
0
7
 
)
d=( 
7
0
​	
  
0
7
​	
 )
now, i need to find the determinant of this matrix. i recall that the determinant of a 2x2 matrix:

(
a
b
c
d
 
)
( 
a
c
​	
  
b
d
​	
 )
is calculated as 
a
d
−
b
c
ad−bc. so, applying that to my matrix 
d
d:

det
⁡
d
=
(
7
)
(
7
)
−
(
0
)
(
0
)
=
49
−
0
=
49
detd=(7)(7)−(0)(0)=49−0=49
wait a minute, is that all? it seems too straightforward. maybe i should consider if there's another way to think about this. i remember that the determinant of a matrix can also be interpreted as the scaling factor of the area when the matrix is applied as a linear transformation.

since dilation scales all distances by a factor of 7, it should scale areas by the square of the scale factor. so, areas are scaled by 
7
2
=
49
7 
2
 =49, which matches the determinant i just calculated. that seems consistent.

let me try to think of another approach. maybe using eigenvalues? the eigenvalues of a dilation matrix should all be equal to the scale factor, right? so, for a 2x2 dilation matrix with scale factor 7, the eigenvalues are both 7. the determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues, so 
7
×
7
=
49
7×7=49. again, i get 49.

alright, so both methods give me the same answer. it seems like the determinant is indeed 49.

wait, just to be thorough, what if the dilation wasn't uniform in all directions? but in this case, since it's a dilation centered at the origin with a single scale factor of 7, it should be uniform in all directions. if it were different scale factors in different directions, the matrix would have different entries, but here, both entries on the diagonal are 7.

let me consider if there's a general formula for the determinant of a dilation matrix. for a dilation with scale factor 
k
k, the matrix should be:

d
=
(
k
0
0
k
 
)
d=( 
k
0
​	
  
0
k
​	
 )
and its determinant would be 
k
2
k 
2
 . plugging in 
k
=
7
k=7, i get 
49
49, which matches my previous results.

is there any chance that the matrix could be different? maybe if it's not axis-aligned? but the problem specifies it's a dilation centered at the origin, which typically implies it's uniform in all directions and axis-aligned.

just to be absolutely sure, let's consider a general linear transformation matrix:

(
a
b
c
d
 
)
( 
a
c
​	
  
b
d
​	
 )
for a dilation centered at the origin with scale factor 7, we want this transformation to scale vectors by 7 in all directions. this means that the matrix should satisfy:

d
(
x
y
 
)
=
7
(
x
y
 
)
d( 
x
y
​	
 )=7( 
x
y
​	
 )
which implies:

a
x
+
b
y
=
7
x
ax+by=7x
c
x
+
d
y
=
7
y
cx+dy=7y
for all 
x
x and 
y
y. this can only be true if 
a
=
7
a=7, 
d
=
7
d=7, and 
b
=
0
b=0, 
c
=
0
c=0. so again, i confirm that:

d
=
(
7
0
0
7
 
)
d=( 
7
0
​	
  
0
7
​	
 )
and thus, 
det
⁡
d
=
49
detd=49.

i think i've covered all possible angles here. the determinant is indeed 49.

**final answer**

49​
