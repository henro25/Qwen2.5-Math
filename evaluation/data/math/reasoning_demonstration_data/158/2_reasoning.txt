Reasoning: So i've got this problem here about finding the total surface area of a hemisphere, including its circular base. the hemisphere has a radius of 6 cm, and i need to express the answer in terms of π. let's see how to approach this.

first off, i know that a hemisphere is basically half of a sphere. the formula for the surface area of a full sphere is given as 4πr², where r is the radius. since a hemisphere is half of that, i might think that its surface area would be half of 4πr², which would be 2πr². but wait, the problem says to include the area of its circular base. so, i need to make sure i'm accounting for that extra area.

let me break this down. the hemisphere has two parts to its surface area: the curved outer part and the flat circular base. the curved part is indeed half of the sphere's surface area, which is 2πr². then, there's the circular base, which is a flat circle with radius r. the area of a circle is πr². so, to get the total surface area of the hemisphere, i should add the area of the curved part and the area of the base together.

so, total surface area = curved surface area + base area

total surface area = 2πr² + πr²

total surface area = 3πr²

that seems straightforward. but let me double-check to make sure i'm not missing anything. sometimes, with hemispheres, there can be confusion about whether to include the base or not, but the problem clearly says to include it, so that's good.

given that the radius r is 6 cm, i can plug that value into the formula.

total surface area = 3π(6 cm)²

first, calculate (6 cm)², which is 36 cm².

then, multiply by 3: 3 * 36 cm² = 108 cm²

finally, include π: 108π cm²

so, the total surface area should be 108π cm².

wait a minute, let me visualize this to be sure. if i imagine cutting a sphere exactly in half, the curved surface of the hemisphere would indeed be half of the sphere's surface area. and the flat circular base is just one circle with the same radius as the hemisphere. adding them up makes sense.

i should also consider if there are any other surfaces to account for, but in this case, it's just the outer curved surface and the base. no other parts are exposed.

let me also think about units to ensure consistency. the radius is given in centimeters, and since area is in square units, the answer should be in square centimeters, which it is.

alright, i'm confident with this approach and the calculation.

**final answer**

108

108π
