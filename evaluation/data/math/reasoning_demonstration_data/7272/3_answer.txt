Answer: Given that the norm of vector \(\mathbf{v}\), denoted as \(\|\mathbf{v}\|\), is 4, we need to find \(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}\).

we know that the norm of a vector is related to its dot product with itself by the formula:
\[
\|\mathbf{v}\|^2 = \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}
\]

given \(\|\mathbf{v}\| = 4\), we can square both sides to get:
\[
\|\mathbf{v}\|^2 = 4^2 = 16
\]

therefore, we have:
\[
\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 16
\]

thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]
