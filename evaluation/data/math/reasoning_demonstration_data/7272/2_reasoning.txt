Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: if the norm of vector v, written as ||v||, is 4, then i need to find v dot v, which is v ⋅ v. okay, first things first, i need to remember what the norm of a vector is and what the dot product represents.

i recall that the norm of a vector, ||v||, is like its length or magnitude. and the dot product of a vector with itself, v ⋅ v, is related to the square of its magnitude. there's a formula that connects these two concepts.

let me think... oh yeah, i think it's that ||v|| squared is equal to v ⋅ v. so, ||v||² = v ⋅ v. if that's the case, then if ||v|| is 4, then ||v||² would be 4 squared, which is 16. therefore, v ⋅ v should be 16.

wait, is there a way to verify this? maybe i should consider the components of the vector to make sure i'm not missing something.

suppose v is in n-dimensional space, and it has components v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ. then, the dot product v ⋅ v would be v₁² + v₂² + ... + vₙ². and the norm ||v|| is the square root of that sum, so ||v|| = √(v₁² + v₂² + ... + vₙ²). therefore, ||v||² = v₁² + v₂² + ... + vₙ², which is exactly v ⋅ v.

so, this confirms that ||v||² = v ⋅ v. given that ||v|| is 4, then v ⋅ v is 4², which is 16.

is there any other way to look at this? maybe using the definition of the dot product in terms of angles, but that seems more complicated for this problem since it's just the dot product of the vector with itself.

alternatively, if i think about the geometric interpretation, the dot product of a vector with itself should give a measure related to its magnitude, and indeed, it should be the square of its magnitude.

i don't see any reason to doubt this conclusion. it seems straightforward.

just to be extra sure, let's consider a specific example. suppose v is a 2-dimensional vector, say v = (3, √7). then, ||v|| = √(3² + (√7)²) = √(9 + 7) = √16 = 4, which matches the given norm. now, v ⋅ v = 3*3 + √7*√7 = 9 + 7 = 16, which again matches my earlier conclusion.

therefore, no matter how i look at it, v ⋅ v should be 16 when ||v|| is 4.

**final answer**

16
