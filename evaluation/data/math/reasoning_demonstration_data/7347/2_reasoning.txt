Reasoning: I've got this functional equation to solve:

f
(
f
(
x
−
y
)
)
=
f
(
x
)
f
(
y
)
−
f
(
x
)
+
f
(
y
)
−
x
y
f(f(x−y))=f(x)f(y)−f(x)+f(y)−xy
for all real numbers 
x
x and 
y
y. i need to find the sum of all possible values of 
f
(
1
)
f(1).

first, i should probably look for some special values of 
x
x and 
y
y that might simplify the equation or give me some information about the function 
f
f.

let me try setting 
x
=
y
x=y. if i do that, then 
x
−
y
=
0
x−y=0, so the left side becomes 
f
(
f
(
0
)
)
f(f(0)).

so plugging in 
x
=
y
x=y:

f
(
f
(
0
)
)
=
f
(
x
)
f
(
x
)
−
f
(
x
)
+
f
(
x
)
−
x
2
f(f(0))=f(x)f(x)−f(x)+f(x)−x 
2
 
simplify the right side:

f
(
f
(
0
)
)
=
f
(
x
)
2
−
f
(
x
)
+
f
(
x
)
−
x
2
f(f(0))=f(x) 
2
 −f(x)+f(x)−x 
2
 
f
(
f
(
0
)
)
=
f
(
x
)
2
−
x
2
f(f(0))=f(x) 
2
 −x 
2
 
hmm, that's interesting. this seems to relate 
f
(
x
)
2
f(x) 
2
  to 
f
(
f
(
0
)
)
+
x
2
f(f(0))+x 
2
 . maybe i can express 
f
(
x
)
f(x) in terms of 
x
x.

let me consider the possibility that 
f
(
x
)
f(x) is a linear function. suppose 
f
(
x
)
=
a
x
+
b
f(x)=ax+b, where 
a
a and 
b
b are constants.

then, 
f
(
x
−
y
)
=
a
(
x
−
y
)
+
b
f(x−y)=a(x−y)+b, and 
f
(
f
(
x
−
y
)
)
=
a
(
a
(
x
−
y
)
+
b
)
+
b
=
a
2
(
x
−
y
)
+
a
b
+
b
f(f(x−y))=a(a(x−y)+b)+b=a 
2
 (x−y)+ab+b.

on the right side:

f
(
x
)
f
(
y
)
−
f
(
x
)
+
f
(
y
)
−
x
y
=
(
a
x
+
b
)
(
a
y
+
b
)
−
(
a
x

)
+
(
a
y
+
b
)
−
x
y
f(x)f(y)−f(x)+f(y)−xy=(ax+b)(ay+b)−(ax+b)+(ay+b)−xy
let's expand this:

(
a
x
+
b
)
(
a
y
+
b
)
=
a
2
x
y
+
a
b

(ax+b)(ay+b)=a

=

(

)
=
a

+

combine all terms:

y

2
=(a 
2
 −1)xy+(ab−a)x+(ab+a)y+b 
2
 
set this equal to the left side, which was:

a
2
(
x
−
y
)
+
a
b
+
b
=
a
2
x
−
a
2
y
+
a
b
+
b
a 
2
 (x−y)+ab+b=a 
2
 x−a 
2

so, we have:

a

x
−
a

y
+
a
b
+
b
=
(
a

−

)

2
a 
2
 x−a 
2
 y+ab+b=(a 
2
 −1)xy+(ab−a)x+(ab+a)y+b 
2
 
now, for these two expressions to be equal for all 
x
x and 
y
y, the coefficients of like terms must be equal.

first, look at the coefficients of 
x
y
xy:

left side: 0 (since there's no 
x
y
xy term)

right side: 
a
2
−
1
a 
2
 −1

therefore:

a
2
−
1
=
0
a 
2
 −1=0
a
2
=
1
a 
2
 =1
a
=
1
 or 
a
=
−
1
a=1 or a=−1
next, look at the coefficients of 
x
x:

left side: 
a
2
a 
2
  (from 
a
2
x
a 
2
 x)

right side: 
a
b
−
a
ab−a

so:

a
2
=
a
b
−
a
a 
2
 =ab−a
similarly, coefficients of 
y
y:

left side: 
−
a
2
−a 
2
  (from 
−
a
2
y
−a 
2
 y)

right side: 
a
b
+
a
ab+a

so:

−
a
2
=
a
b
+
a
−a 
2
 =ab+a
and the constant terms:

left side: 
a
b
+
b
ab+b

right side: 
b
2
b 
2
 

so:

a
b
+
b
=
b
2
ab+b=b 
2
 
now, let's consider the two cases for 
a
a:

**case 1: 
a
=
1
a=1**

plug 
a
=
1
a=1 into the equations:

from 
a
2
=
a
b
−
a
a 
2
 =ab−a:

1
=
b
−
1
1=b−1
b
=
2
b=2
from 
−
a
2
=
a
b
+
a
−a 
2
 =ab+a:

−
1
=
2
+
1
−1=2+1
−
1
=
3
−1=3
wait, that's not possible. contradiction.

so, 
a
=
1
a=1 is not a valid solution.

**case 2: 
a
=
−
1
a=−1**

plug 
a
=
−
1
a=−1 into the equations:

from 
a
2
=
a
b
−
a
a 
2
 =ab−a:

1
=
−
b
−
(
−
1
)
1=−b−(−1)
1
=
−
b
+
1
1=−b+1
0
=
−
b
0=−b
b
=
0
b=0
from 
−
a
2
=
a
b
+
a
−a 
2
 =ab+a:

−
1
=
0
+
(
−
1
)
−1=0+(−1)
−
1
=
−
1
−1=−1
this holds.

from 
a
b
+
b
=
b
2
ab+b=b 
2
 :

−
1
⋅
0
+
0
=
0
2
−1⋅0+0=0 
2
 
0
=
0
0=0
also holds.

so, the only possible linear function is 
f
(
x
)
=
−
x
f(x)=−x.

let me check if this function satisfies the original equation.

set 
f
(
x
)
=
−
x
f(x)=−x:

left side:

f
(
f
(
x
−
y
)
)
=
f
(
−
(
x
−
y
)
)
=
f
(
−
x
+
y
)
=
−
(
−
x
+
y
)
=
x
−
y
f(f(x−y))=f(−(x−y))=f(−x+y)=−(−x+y)=x−y
right side:

f
(
x
)
f
(
y
)
−
f
(
x
)
+
f
(
y
)
−
x
y
=
(
−
x
)
(
−
y
)
−
(
−
x
)
+
(
−
y
)
−
x
y
f(x)f(y)−f(x)+f(y)−xy=(−x)(−y)−(−x)+(−y)−xy
=
x
y
+
x
−
y
−
x
y
=xy+x−y−xy
=
x
−
y
=x−y
yes, both sides are equal. so, 
f
(
x
)
=
−
x
f(x)=−x is indeed a solution.

now, are there any other possible solutions? maybe non-linear ones.

let me consider if there are constant solutions. suppose 
f
(
x
)
=
c
f(x)=c for some constant 
c
c.

then, the left side:

f
(
f
(
x
−
y
)
)
=
f
(
c
)
=
c
f(f(x−y))=f(c)=c
right side:

f
(
x
)
f
(
y
)
−
f
(
x
)
+
f
(
y
)
−
x
y
=
c
⋅
c
−
c
+
c
−
x
y
=
c
2
−
c
+
c
−
x
y
=
c
2
−
x
y
f(x)f(y)−f(x)+f(y)−xy=c⋅c−c+c−xy=c 
2
 −c+c−xy=c 
2
 −xy
so, 
c
=
c
2
−
x
y
c=c 
2
 −xy. but this must hold for all 
x
x and 
y
y, which is only possible if 
c
2
=
c
c 
2
 =c and 
−
x
y
=
0
−xy=0, but 
−
x
y
=
0
−xy=0 only if 
x
=
0
x=0 or 
y
=
0
y=0, which is not true for all 
x
,
y
x,y. so, no constant solutions.

what about quadratic functions? suppose 
f
(
x
)
=
a
x
2
+
b
x
+
c
f(x)=ax 
2
 +bx+c. this might get messy, but let's try.

first, find 
f
(
x
−
y
)
=
a
(
x
−
y
)
2
+
b
(
x
−
y
)
+
c
=
a
(
x
2
−
2
x
y
+
y
2
)
+
b
x
−
b
y
+
c
=
a
x
2
−
2
a
x
y
+
a
y
2
+
b
x
−
b
y
+
c
f(x−y)=a(x−y) 
2
 +b(x−y)+c=a(x 
2
 −2xy+y 
2
 )+bx−by+c=ax 
2
 −2axy+ay 
2
 +bx−by+c.

then, 
f
(
f
(
x
−
y
)
)
=
a
(
a
x
2
−
2
a
x
y
+
a
y
2
+
b
x
−
b
y
+
c
)
2
+
b
(
a
x
2
−
2
a
x
y
+
a
y
2
+
b
x
−
b
y
+
c
)
+
c
f(f(x−y))=a(ax 
2
 −2axy+ay 
2
 +bx−by+c) 
2
 +b(ax 
2
 −2axy+ay 
2
 +bx−by+c)+c.

this looks too complicated to handle. maybe there are other approaches.

let me try to find 
f
(
0
)
f(0). set 
x
=
y
x=y, then from earlier:

f
(
f
(
0
)
)
=
f
(
x
)
2
−
x
2
f(f(0))=f(x) 
2
 −x 
2
 
but i need another equation involving 
f
(
0
)
f(0).

let me set 
y
=
0
y=0 in the original equation:

f
(
f
(
x
−
0
)
)
=
f
(
x
)
f
(
0
)
−
f
(
x
)
+
f
(
0
)
−
x
⋅
0
f(f(x−0))=f(x)f(0)−f(x)+f(0)−x⋅0
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
=
f
(
x
)
f
(
0
)
−
f
(
x
)
+
f
(
0
)
f(f(x))=f(x)f(0)−f(x)+f(0)
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
=
f
(
x
)
(
f
(
0
)
−
1
)
+
f
(
0
)
f(f(x))=f(x)(f(0)−1)+f(0)
now, i have two expressions involving 
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
f(f(x)):

from earlier, 
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
=
f
(
x
)
2
−
x
2
f(f(x))=f(x) 
2
 −x 
2
  (wait, is that correct? let me check.

earlier, i set 
x
=
y
x=y and got 
f
(
f
(
0
)
)
=
f
(
x
)
2
−
x
2
f(f(0))=f(x) 
2
 −x 
2
 . but actually, that was from setting 
x
=
y
x=y, which gives 
f
(
f
(
0
)
)
=
f
(
x
)
2
−
x
2
f(f(0))=f(x) 
2
 −x 
2
 , not directly 
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
f(f(x)).

wait, i need to be careful.

from setting 
x
=
y
x=y, i have:

f
(
f
(
0
)
)
=
f
(
x
)
2
−
x
2
f(f(0))=f(x) 
2
 −x 
2
 
this suggests that 
f
(
x
)
2
=
f
(
f
(
0
)
)
+
x
2
f(x) 
2
 =f(f(0))+x 
2
 , which implies 
f
(
x
)
=
±
f
(
f
(
0
)
)
+
x
2
f(x)=± 
f(f(0))+x 
2
 
​	
 .

this seems problematic because 
f
(
x
)
f(x) would not generally be linear unless 
f
(
f
(
0
)
)
=
0
f(f(0))=0, which would make 
f
(
x
)
=
±
x
f(x)=±x. but earlier, only 
f
(
x
)
=
−
x
f(x)=−x worked.

alternatively, perhaps i need to consider that 
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
=
f
(
x
)
(
f
(
0
)
−
1
)
+
f
(
0
)
f(f(x))=f(x)(f(0)−1)+f(0) and also relate it to 
f
(
x
)
2
−
x
2
f(x) 
2
 −x 
2
 .

wait, perhaps i can set 
x
=
0
x=0 in the original equation to find more information.

set 
x
=
0
x=0:

f
(
f
(
−
y
)
)
=
f
(
0
)
f
(
y
)
−
f
(
0
)
+
f
(
y
)
−
0
⋅
y
f(f(−y))=f(0)f(y)−f(0)+f(y)−0⋅y
f
(
f
(
−
y
)
)
=
f
(
0
)
f
(
y
)
−
f
(
0
)
+
f
(
y
)
f(f(−y))=f(0)f(y)−f(0)+f(y)
f
(
f
(
−
y
)
)
=
(
f
(
0
)
+
1
)
f
(
y
)
−
f
(
0
)
f(f(−y))=(f(0)+1)f(y)−f(0)
similarly, set 
y
=
x
y=x:

f
(
f
(
0
)
)
=
f
(
x
)
2
−
x
2
f(f(0))=f(x) 
2
 −x 
2
 
this suggests that 
f
(
x
)
2
=
f
(
f
(
0
)
)
+
x
2
f(x) 
2
 =f(f(0))+x 
2
 , so 
f
(
x
)
=
f
(
f
(
0
)
)
+
x
2
f(x)= 
f(f(0))+x 
2
 
​	
  or 
f
(
x
)
=
−
f
(
f
(
0
)
)
+
x
2
f(x)=− 
f(f(0))+x 
2
 
​	
 .

if 
f
(
f
(
0
)
)
=
c
f(f(0))=c, then 
f
(
x
)
2
=
c
+
x
2
f(x) 
2
 =c+x 
2
 , so 
f
(
x
)
=
±
c
+
x
2
f(x)=± 
c+x 
2
 
​	
 .

but earlier, only 
f
(
x
)
=
−
x
f(x)=−x worked when assuming linearity. maybe the general solution is 
f
(
x
)
=
−
x
f(x)=−x, and perhaps there are no other solutions.

alternatively, perhaps 
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
=
−
x
f(f(x))=−x, but i need to verify.

from earlier, with 
f
(
x
)
=
−
x
f(x)=−x, we have 
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
=
f
(
−
x
)
=
−
(
−
x
)
=
x
f(f(x))=f(−x)=−(−x)=x. but from the equation 
f
(
f

)
=
f
(

(
f
(
0
)
−
1
)
+
f
(
0
)
f(f(x))=f(x)(f(0)−1)+f(0), and since 
f
(
0
)
=
0
f(0)=0, this gives 
f
(
f

)
=
f
(

(
−

−
1
)
+
0
=
−
2
f
(

)
f(f(x))=f(x)(−1−1)+0=−2f(x), but in reality, 
f
(
f

)
=
x
f(f(x))=x, so 
x

(

)
x=−2(−x), which simplifies to 
x
=
2
x
x=2x, which only holds if 
x
=
0
x=0. contradiction.

wait, perhaps i made a mistake.

if 
f
(
x
)
=
−
x
f(x)=−x, then 
f
(
0
)
=
0
f(0)=0, and 
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
=
x
f(f(x))=x, as above.

from the earlier equation, 
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
=
f
(
x
)
(
f
(
0
)
−
1
)
+
f
(
0
)
f(f(x))=f(x)(f(0)−1)+f(0), which becomes 
x
=
(
−
x
)
(
−

−

)
+
0
=
(
−
x
)
(
−
2
)
=

x
x=(−x)(−1−1)+0=(−x)(−2)=2x. so, 
x
=
2
x
x=2x, which implies 
x
=
0
x=0. this is only true for 
x
=
0
x=0, not for all 
x
x. so, maybe the assumption that 
f
(
x
)
f(x) is linear is incomplete.

alternatively, perhaps 
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
=
−
x
f(f(x))=−x, but i need to check.

wait, let's reconsider the equation 
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
=
f
(
x
)
(
f
(
0
)
−
1
)
+
f
(
0
)
f(f(x))=f(x)(f(0)−1)+f(0).

given that 
f
(
0
)
=
0
f(0)=0, this simplifies to 
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
=
−
f
(
x
)
f(f(x))=−f(x).

but earlier, with 
f
(
x
)
=
−
x
f(x)=−x, 
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
=
x
f(f(x))=x, which would require 
x
=
−
(
−
x
)
=
x
x=−(−x)=x, which holds, but according to the equation, it should be 
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
=
−
f
(
x
)
=
x
f(f(x))=−f(x)=x, which also holds. wait, no, 
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
=
x
f(f(x))=x, and according to the equation, it should be 
−
f
(
x
)
=
x
−f(x)=x, which matches since 
f
(
x
)
=
−
x
f(x)=−x. so, it's consistent.

perhaps i need to accept that the only solution is 
f
(
x
)
=
−
x
f(x)=−x, and thus 
f
(
1
)
=
−
1
f(1)=−1, and the sum of all possible values is just 
−
1
−1.

alternatively, maybe there are other solutions, but i need to confirm.

let me assume that 
f
(
x
)
=
−
x
f(x)=−x is the only solution.

therefore, the sum of all possible values of 
f
(
1
)
f(1) is 
−
1
−1.
