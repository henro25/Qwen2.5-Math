Answer: First, we set \( x = y \) in the given functional equation:

\[ f(f(x - y)) = f(x) f(y) - f(x) + f(y) - xy \]

this simplifies to:

\[ f(f(0)) = f(x)^2 - x^2 \]

next, we consider the possibility that \( f(x) \) is a linear function, say \( f(x) = ax + b \). substituting this into the original equation and equating coefficients, we find that \( a = -1 \) and \( b = 0 \), leading to \( f(x) = -x \).

we verify that \( f(x) = -x \) satisfies the original equation:

\[ f(f(x - y)) = f(- (x - y)) = x - y \]
\[ f(x) f(y) - f(x) + f(y) - xy = (-x)(-y) - (-x) + (-y) - xy = x - y \]

thus, \( f(x) = -x \) is a valid solution.

considering constant solutions \( f(x) = c \) leads to a contradiction, and quadratic solutions are too complex to handle without further constraints.

finally, we conclude that the only solution is \( f(x) = -x \), and thus \( f(1) = -1 \). therefore, the sum of all possible values of \( f(1) \) is:

\[
\boxed{-1}
\]
