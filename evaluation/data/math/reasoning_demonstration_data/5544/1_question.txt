Problem: A right square pyramid with base edges of length $8\sqrt{2}$ units each and slant edges of length 10 units each is cut by a plane that is parallel to its base and 3 units above its base. What is the volume, in cubic units, of the new pyramid that is cut off by this plane? [asy]
import three;
size(2.5inch);
currentprojection = orthographic(1/2,-1,1/4);
triple A = (0,0,6);
triple[] base = new triple[4];
base[0] = (-4, -4, 0);

base[1] = (4, -4, 0);
base[2] = (4, 4, 0);
base[3] = (-4, 4, 0);
triple[] mid = new triple[4];
for(int i=0; i < 4; ++i)
mid[i] = (.6*xpart(base[i]) + .4*xpart(A), .6*ypart(base[i]) + .4*ypart(A), .6*zpart(base[i]) + .4*zpart(A));
for(int i=0; i < 4; ++i)

draw(A--base[i]);
draw(base[i]--base[(i+1)%4]);

label("$8\sqrt{2}$ units", base[0]--base[1]);
label("10 units", base[0]--A, 2*W);
