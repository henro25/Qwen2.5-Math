Problem: Sequence $A$ is a geometric sequence. Sequence $B$ is an arithmetic sequence. Each sequence stops as soon as one of its terms is greater than $300.$ What is the least positive difference between a number selected from sequence $A$ and a number selected from sequence $B?$

$\bullet$ Sequence $A:$ $2,$ $4,$ $8,$ $16,$ $32,$ $\ldots$

$\bullet$ Sequence $B:$ $20,$ $40,$ $60,$ $80,$ $100,$ $\ldots$
