Answer: To solve the equation \(\frac{x^2 + x + 1}{x + 1} = x + 2\) for \(x\), we start by eliminating the fraction. we multiply both sides by \(x + 1\) (noting that \(x \neq -1\)):

\[
x^2 + x + 1 = (x + 2)(x + 1)
\]

next, we expand the right-hand side:

\[
(x + 2)(x + 1) = x^2 + 3x + 2
\]

this gives us the equation:

\[
x^2 + x + 1 = x^2 + 3x + 2
\]

we subtract \(x^2\) from both sides:

\[
x + 1 = 3x + 2
\]

then, we isolate \(x\) by subtracting \(x\) and 2 from both sides:

\[
1 - 2 = 2x \implies -1 = 2x \implies x = -\frac{1}{2}
\]

we verify that \(x = -\frac{1}{2}\) does not make the denominator zero in the original equation:

\[
-\frac{1}{2} + 1 = \frac{1}{2} \neq 0
\]

finally, we check the solution by substituting \(x = -\frac{1}{2}\) back into the original equation:

left side:

\[
\frac{(-\frac{1}{2})^2 + (-\frac{1}{2}) + 1}{-\frac{1}{2} + 1} = \frac{\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{2} + 1}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{3}{4}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{2}{1} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

right side:

\[
-\frac{1}{2} + 2 = \frac{3}{2}
\]

both sides are equal, confirming that \(x = -\frac{1}{2}\) is the correct solution.

\[
\boxed{-\frac{1}{2}}
\]
