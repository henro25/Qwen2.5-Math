Reasoning: So i need to solve this equation: \[\frac{x^2 + x + 1}{x + 1} = x + 2\]. hmm, okay, let's see. first, i should probably get rid of the fraction to make it easier to work with. so, i can multiply both sides of the equation by 
x
+
1
x+1, but i have to remember that 
x
x can't be 
−
1
−1 because that would make the denominator zero. got it, so 
x
≠
−
1
x

=−1.

alright, multiplying both sides by 
x
+
1
x+1, i get:

x
2
+
x
+
1
=
(
x
+
2
)
(
x
+
1
)
x 
2
 +x+1=(x+2)(x+1)
now, i need to expand the right side. so, let's do that:

(
x
+
2
)
(
x
+
1
)
=
x
⋅
x
+
x
⋅
1
+
2
⋅
x
+
2
⋅
1
=
x
2
+
x
+
2
x
+
2
=
x
2
+
3
x
+
2
(x+2)(x+1)=x⋅x+x⋅1+2⋅x+2⋅1=x 
2
 +x+2x+2=x 
2
 +3x+2
so now the equation is:

x
2
+
x
+
1
=
x
2
+
3
x
+
2
x 
2
 +x+1=x 
2
 +3x+2
hmm, i can subtract 
x
2
x 
2
  from both sides to simplify:

x
+
1
=
3
x
+
2
x+1=3x+2
now, let's get all the 
x
x terms on one side and constants on the other. i'll subtract 
x
x from both sides:

1
=
2
x
+
2
1=2x+2
then, subtract 2 from both sides:

−
1
=
2
x
−1=2x
finally, divide both sides by 2:

x
=
−
1
2
x=− 
2
1

wait a minute, but i need to make sure that this solution doesn't make the denominator zero in the original equation. the denominator is 
x
+
1
x+1, so plugging in 
x
=
−
1
2
x=− 
2
1
​	
 :

−
1
2
+
1
=
1
2
≠
0
− 
2
1
​	
 +1= 
2
1
​	
 

=0
okay, that's good. so, 
x
=
−
1
2
x=− 
2
1
​	
  is a valid solution.

just to double-check, i can plug 
x
=
−
1
2
x=− 
2
1
​	
  back into the original equation to see if both sides are equal.

−

​	
 
both sides are equal, so 
x

−

x=−

1
​	
  is indeed the correct solution.

i think that's it. i don't see any other possible solutions, and i've checked that the solution doesn't make the denominator zero. so, the answer should be 
x
=
−
1
2
x=− 
2
1
​	
 .

**final answer**
