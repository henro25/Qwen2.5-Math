Reasoning: Okay, so I've got this problem here. Alice buys three burgers and two sodas for $3.20, and Bill buys two burgers and one soda for $2.00. I need to find out how much one burger costs in cents. Alright, let's see.

First, I should probably set up some equations to represent what's going on. Let's say the cost of one burger is B dollars, and the cost of one soda is S dollars. So, for Alice, buying three burgers and two sodas would be 3B + 2S = 3.20 dollars. And for Bill, buying two burgers and one soda would be 2B + S = 2.00 dollars.

Now, I have two equations:

1. 3B + 2S = 3.20

2. 2B + S = 2.00

I need to solve for B, the cost of one burger. Since there are two variables here, B and S, I can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination because it seems straightforward.

From equation 2, I can solve for S in terms of B. So, 2B + S = 2.00, which means S = 2.00 - 2B.

Now, I can substitute this expression for S into equation 1.

So, 3B + 2(2.00 - 2B) = 3.20

Let's simplify that:

3B + 4.00 - 4B = 3.20

Combining like terms: -B + 4.00 = 3.20

Subtract 4.00 from both sides: -B = -0.80

Multiply both sides by -1: B = 0.80

So, one burger costs $0.80. But the question asks for the cost in cents. Since $0.80 is 80 cents, the answer should be 80 cents.

Wait a minute, let me double-check that. If one burger is $0.80, then two burgers would be $1.60, and one soda would be 2.00 - 1.60 = $0.40.

Now, checking Alice's purchase: 3 burgers at $0.80 each is 3 * 0.80 = $2.40, and two sodas at $0.40 each is 2 * 0.40 = $0.80. Total should be $2.40 + $0.80 = $3.20, which matches the given amount. So, it seems correct.

But wait, is there another way to solve this? Maybe using fractions or something else? Hmm.

Alternatively, I could use the elimination method by making the coefficients of S the same in both equations.

Equation 1: 3B + 2S = 3.20

Equation 2: 2B + S = 2.00

If I multiply equation 2 by 2, I get: 4B + 2S = 4.00

Now, subtract equation 1 from this new equation:

4B + 2S - (3B + 2S) = 4.00 - 3.20

Which simplifies to B = 0.80

Again, B = $0.80, which is 80 cents. So, consistent result.

I think that's solid. But to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other possible interpretation of the problem.

Is there any chance that the sodas or burgers have tax or something like that? The problem doesn't mention anything about tax, so I can safely assume that the prices given include everything.

Also, the problem specifies "cents," so I need to make sure to convert dollars to cents in the final answer. Since $0.80 is 80 cents, that's straightforward.

Just to be extra careful, let's plug the values back into both equations to ensure they hold true.

First equation: 3B + 2S = 3.20

With B = 0.80 and S = 0.40:

3*(0.80) + 2*(0.40) = 2.40 + 0.80 = 3.20. Correct.

Second equation: 2B + S = 2.00

2*(0.80) + 0.40 = 1.60 + 0.40 = 2.00. Correct.

No issues there.

I think that's it. The burger costs 80 cents.
