Answer: **Step 1:** Let the cost of one burger be \( B \) dollars and one soda be \( S \) dollars.

**Step 2:** Set up the equations based on the purchases:
- Alice: \( 3B + 2S = 3.20 \)
- Bill: \( 2B + S = 2.00 \)

**Step 3:** Solve for \( S \) from Bill's equation:
\[ S = 2.00 - 2B \]

**Step 4:** Substitute \( S \) into Alice's equation:
\[ 3B + 2(2.00 - 2B) = 3.20 \]

**Step 5:** Simplify and solve for \( B \):
\[ 3B + 4.00 - 4B = 3.20 \]
\[ -B + 4.00 = 3.20 \]
\[ -B = -0.80 \]
\[ B = 0.80 \]

**Step 6:** Convert dollars to cents:
\[ 0.80 \text{ dollars} = 80 \text{ cents} \]

**Verification:**
- For Alice: \( 3(0.80) + 2(0.40) = 2.40 + 0.80 = 3.20 \)
- For Bill: \( 2(0.80) + 0.40 = 1.60 + 0.40 = 2.00 \)

Both equations hold true, confirming the solution is correct.

**Answer:** The burger costs 80 cents.
