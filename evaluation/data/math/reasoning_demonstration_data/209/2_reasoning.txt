Reasoning: So i need to simplify the square root of 288. hmm, square roots can be tricky, but i think if i break it down into smaller parts, it'll be easier. first off, i know that simplifying a square root involves finding perfect squares that are factors of the number inside the root. perfect squares are numbers like 4, 9, 16, 25, and so on, because their square roots are whole numbers.

so, my goal is to factor 288 into a product of a perfect square and another number. then, i can take the square root of the perfect square out of the radical. let me start by finding the prime factors of 288 to see which perfect squares i can identify.

let's begin with prime factorization. i know that 288 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2.

288 ÷ 2 = 144

144 is also even, so divide by 2 again.

144 ÷ 2 = 72

72 is even, so divide by 2 once more.

72 ÷ 2 = 36

36 is still even, so divide by 2 again.

36 ÷ 2 = 18

18 is even, so divide by 2 one more time.

18 ÷ 2 = 9

now, 9 is not even, but it's divisible by 3.

9 ÷ 3 = 3

and 3 ÷ 3 = 1

so, the prime factors of 288 are 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3.

let me write that down more neatly:

288 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3

now, i can group these factors into pairs because square roots involve pairs of the same number.

let's group them:

(2 × 2) × (2 × 2) × (2) × (3 × 3)

so, that's 2^2 × 2^2 × 2 × 3^2

now, i can take the square roots of the perfect squares out of the radical.

√(2^2 × 2^2 × 2 × 3^2) = √(2^2) × √(2^2) × √(2) × √(3^2)

which simplifies to:

2 × 2 × √2 × 3

now, multiply the numbers outside the radical:

2 × 2 = 4

4 × 3 = 12

so, i have 12 × √2

therefore, √288 = 12√2

wait a minute, let me double-check that. maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.

another method is to look for the largest perfect square that divides 288.

i know that 144 is a perfect square because 12^2 = 144.

does 144 divide 288?

yes, because 288 ÷ 144 = 2

so, √288 = √(144 × 2) = √144 × √2 = 12√2

okay, that matches what i got earlier.

let me try another perfect square, say 36.

36 × 8 = 288

but 8 is not a perfect square, so that doesn't help.

what about 64?

64 × 4.5 = 288, but 4.5 isn't an integer, so that's not helpful.

wait, i should look for perfect squares that are factors of 288.

the perfect squares less than 288 are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256

from these, 144 is the largest that divides 288 evenly, as we saw.

so, it seems like 12√2 is the simplest form.

alternatively, if i didn't think of 144, i could have started with smaller perfect squares.

for example, take 16.

288 ÷ 16 = 18

so, √288 = √(16 × 18) = √16 × √18 = 4√18

but √18 can be simplified further because 18 = 9 × 2, and 9 is a perfect square.

so, √18 = √(9 × 2) = √9 × √2 = 3√2

therefore, 4√18 = 4 × 3√2 = 12√2

again, i end up with 12√2.

alternatively, if i take 36 as the perfect square:

288 ÷ 36 = 8

so, √288 = √(36 × 8) = √36 × √8 = 6√8

but √8 can be simplified further because 8 = 4 × 2, and 4 is a perfect square.

so, √8 = √(4 × 2) = √4 × √2 = 2√2

therefore, 6√8 = 6 × 2√2 = 12√2

once more, i arrive at 12√2.

it seems no matter which perfect square i choose, as long as it divides 288, i end up with 12√2.

is there any other way to approach this problem? maybe using exponents.

i know that √(a × b) = √a × √b, and that √(a^n) = a^(n/2)

so, if i express 288 in terms of its prime factors raised to their exponents, i can apply this rule.

from earlier, 288 = 2^5 × 3^2

so, √288 = √(2^5 × 3^2) = √(2^4 × 2 × 3^2) = √(2^4) × √2 × √(3^2) = 2^(4/2) × √2 × 3^(2/2) = 2^2 × √2 × 3 = 4 × √2 × 3 = 12√2

again, the same result.

i think i've confirmed it enough times. so, the simplified form of √288 is 12√2.

just to be thorough, maybe i can plug this back in and check if it's correct.

if 12√2 squared is equal to 288, then it should be correct.

so, (12√2)^2 = 12^2 × (√2)^2 = 144 × 2 = 288

yes, that checks out.

alternatively, if i use a calculator to approximate both √288 and 12√2, they should be equal.

√288 ≈ 16.97056275

12√2 ≈ 12 × 1.41421356 ≈ 16.97056275

they are equal, so that confirms it.

i think i've covered all bases here. there might be other methods, but these seem sufficient to arrive at the correct simplified form.
