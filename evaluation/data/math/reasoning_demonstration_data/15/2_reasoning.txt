Reasoning: I've got this problem here about a quartic polynomial, which is a fourth-degree polynomial. the polynomial is given by 
p
(
x
)
=
x
4
+
a
x
3
+
b
x
2
+
c
x
+
d
p(x)=x 
4
 +ax 
3
 +bx 
2
 +cx+d, and there's a graph provided, though i can't see it directly. there are several options to consider, and i need to figure out which one is the smallest.

let's look at each option one by one.

**option a: 
p
(
−
1
)
p(−1)**

first, to find 
p
(
−
1
)
p(−1), i need to plug in 
x
=
−
1
x=−1 into the polynomial:

p
(
−
1
)
=
(
−
1
)
4
+
a
(
−
1
)
3
+
b
(
−
1
)
2
+
c
(
−
1
)
+
d
=
1
−
a
+
b
−
c
+
d
p(−1)=(−1) 
4
 +a(−1) 
3
 +b(−1) 
2
 +c(−1)+d=1−a+b−c+d
but i don't know the values of 
a
,
b
,
c
,
d
a,b,c,d, so i can't compute this directly. maybe there's another way to find this or compare it with other options without knowing the specific coefficients.

**option b: the product of the zeros of 
p
p**

for a polynomial of the form 
x
4
+
a
x
3
+
b
x
2
+
c
x
+
d
x 
4
 +ax 
3
 +bx 
2
 +cx+d, the product of the zeros is given by 
d
d (since for a general polynomial 
x
n
+
a
n
−
1
x
n
−
1
+
⋯
+
a
0
x 
n
 +a 
n−1
​
 x 
n−1
 +⋯+a 
0
​
 , the product of the roots is 
(
−
1
)
n
a
0
(−1) 
n
 a 
0
​
 ). here, 
n
=
4
n=4, so the product is 
d
d.

so, the product of the zeros is 
d
d.

**option c: the product of the non-real zeros of 
p
p**

this one is a bit trickier. if the polynomial has non-real zeros, they come in conjugate pairs because the coefficients are real. so, if there are non-real zeros, their product would be the product of these pairs.

but without knowing how many real zeros there are, it's hard to say exactly what this product is. it could be a single pair or multiple pairs, depending on the polynomial.

**option d: the sum of the coefficients of 
p
p**

the sum of the coefficients is found by plugging in 
x
=
1
x=1:

p
(
1
)
=
1
4
+
a
(
1
)
3
+
b
(
1
)
2
+
c
(
1
)
+
d
=
1
+
a
+
b
+
c
+
d
p(1)=1 
4
 +a(1) 
3
 +b(1) 
2
 +c(1)+d=1+a+b+c+d
again, without knowing the coefficients, i can't compute this directly.

**option e: the sum of the real zeros of 
p
p**

the sum of all zeros of the polynomial is 
−
a
−a (from vieta's formulas). if some zeros are real and some are non-real, the sum of the real zeros would be 
−
a
−a minus the sum of the non-real zeros. since non-real zeros come in conjugate pairs, their sum is real and can be calculated, but without specific values, it's hard to determine this sum.

hmm, this is getting complicated. maybe i should look for relationships between these options.

wait a minute, perhaps i can use vieta's formulas more effectively.

given a quartic polynomial 
x
4
+
a
x
3
+
b
x
2
+
c
x
+
d
x 
4
 +ax 
3
 +bx 
2
 +cx+d, vieta's formulas tell us:

1. sum of zeros: 
−
a
−a

2. sum of products of zeros taken two at a time: 
b
b

3. sum of products of zeros taken three at a time: 
−
c
−c

4. product of zeros: 
d
d

now, considering that non-real zeros come in conjugate pairs, if there are two non-real zeros, say 
α
α and 
α
‾
α
 , their product is 
α
α
‾
=
∣
α
∣
2
α 
α
 =∣α∣ 
2
 , which is positive.

if there are four non-real zeros, they would form two conjugate pairs, and their product would be positive as well.

so, the product of the non-real zeros is positive.

similarly, the product of all zeros is 
d
d, which could be positive or negative depending on the value of 
d
d.

now, the sum of the coefficients is 
p
(
1
)
=
1
+
a
+
b
+
c
+
d
p(1)=1+a+b+c+d, and 
p
(
−
1
)
=
1
−
a
+
b
−
c
+
d
p(−1)=1−a+b−c+d.

i need to find out which of these is the smallest.

let me see if i can make some comparisons.

first, since the product of non-real zeros is positive, option c is positive.

option b is 
d
d, which could be positive or negative.

option a is 
1
−
a
+
b
−
c
+
d
1−a+b−c+d, which is 
p
(
−
1
)
p(−1), and again, without knowing the coefficients, it's hard to say.

option d is 
1
+
a
+
b
+
c
+
d
=
p
(
1
)
1+a+b+c+d=p(1), which also depends on the coefficients.

option e is the sum of the real zeros, which is 
−
a
−a minus the sum of the non-real zeros.

if there are two non-real zeros, their sum is , so the sum of real zeros would be .

this could be positive or negative depending on 
a
a and .

this isn't helping much. maybe i need to consider the graph provided.

looking back at the asymptote code, the function is defined as:

func
(
x
)
=
0.5
(
x

​
 −

​
 −

​

 )+2.7
simplifying this:

func

=
0.5

​
 −

x

​
 −

so, the polynomial is:

​

wait, but in the problem statement, it's given as 
p
(
x
)
=
x
4
+
a
x
3
+
b
x
2
+
c
x
+
d
p(x)=x 
4
 +ax 
3
 +bx 
2
 +cx+d. there must be a scaling factor or something.

looking back, the asymptote code defines the function as:

func
(
x
)
=
0.5
(
x
4
4
−
2
x
3
3

func(x)=0.5(

​
 − 
3
2x

​
 −

​
 x

 )+2.7
so, simplifying:

func

=

−
0.5
(
2
x

func(x)=0.5(

=

x

​
 − 
3
x

​
 −

3x

​
 +2.7
but the problem says 
p
(
x
)
=
x
4
+
a
x
3
+
b
x
2
+
c
x
+
d
p(x)=x 
4
 +ax 
3
 +bx 
2
 +cx+d, which suggests that the leading coefficient is 1. maybe the function in the asymptote code is a scaled version of 
p
(
x
)
p(x).

alternatively, perhaps the polynomial in the graph is a scaled version, and 
p
(
x
)
p(x) is the standard form.

but this is confusing. maybe i should assume that the polynomial given in the asymptote code is 
p
(
x
)
p(x), scaled appropriately.

alternatively, perhaps the asymptote code is just to draw the graph, and the actual polynomial is 
p
(
x
)
=
x
4
+
a
x
3
+
b
x
2
+
c
x
+
d
p(x)=x 
4
 +ax 
3
 +bx 
2
 +cx+d, and the asymptote code is just an example.

but looking at the asymptote code, it defines a specific function:

func
(
x
)
=
0.5
(
x
4
4
−
2
x
3
3
−
3

)
+

func(x)=0.5(

​

x 
4
 
​
 − 
3
x 
3
 
​
 − 
4
3x 
2
 
​
 +2.7
this might be the actual polynomial 
p
(
x
)
p(x), but it doesn't match the standard form given in the problem.

alternatively, perhaps the polynomial in the problem is a general quartic, and the asymptote code is just an example graph.

i think i need to proceed without relying on the specific coefficients from the asymptote code.

let me try to think differently.

option b is the product of the zeros, which is 
d
d.

option c is the product of the non-real zeros.

if there are two real zeros and two non-real zeros, then the product of the non-real zeros is the product of the two non-real zeros.

if all zeros are real, then there are no non-real zeros, so the product is 1 (since the product of an empty set is 1? or is it undefined? maybe 1 by convention.)

but quartic polynomials can have 0, 2, or 4 real zeros.

if there are 4 real zeros, then option c is 1.

if there are 2 real and 2 non-real zeros, then option c is the product of the two non-real zeros, which is positive.

if all zeros are real, then again option c is 1.

option b is 
d
d, which could be positive or negative.

option a is 
p
(
−
1
)
=
1
−
a
+
b
−
c
+
d
p(−1)=1−a+b−c+d.

option d is 
p
(
1
)
=
1
+
a
+
b
+
c
+
d
p(1)=1+a+b+c+d.

option e is the sum of the real zeros.

this is still not helping much.

wait, perhaps i should consider that the smallest among these could be the product of the zeros, which is 
d
d, if 
d
d is negative.

but without knowing 
d
d, i can't be sure.

alternatively, perhaps the sum of the coefficients, 
p
(
1
)
p(1), is always greater than or equal to something.

this is getting too vague. maybe i need to look for a different approach.

let me consider specific values.

suppose all the zeros are real. then, option c is 1 (product of non-real zeros, which are none, so product is 1).

option b is 
d
d, which is the product of all zeros.

if all zeros are real and positive, then 
d
d is positive.

option a is 
p
(
−
1
)
p(−1), which could be anything.

option d is 
p
(
1
)
p(1), again, could be anything.

option e is the sum of the real zeros, which is the sum of all zeros, 
−
a
−a, if all are real.

this isn't helpful.

alternatively, suppose there are two real zeros and two non-real zeros.

then, option c is the product of the two non-real zeros, which is positive.

option b is 
d
d, which is the product of all zeros, which is the product of the two real zeros times the product of the two non-real zeros.

so, 
d
=
(
product of real zeros
)
×
(
product of non-real zeros
)
d=(product of real zeros)×(product of non-real zeros).

since the product of non-real zeros is positive, 
d
d has the same sign as the product of the real zeros.

option a is 
p
(
−
1
)
=
1
−
a
+
b
−
c
+
d
p(−1)=1−a+b−c+d.

option d is 
p
(
1
)
=
1
+
a
+
b
+
c
+
d
p(1)=1+a+b+c+d.

option e is the sum of real zeros, which is 
−
a
−
(
sum of non-real zeros
)
−a−(sum of non-real zeros).

this is getting too convoluted.

maybe i should consider specific values for the coefficients to get an idea.

alternatively, perhaps i can recall that for a quartic polynomial with real coefficients, complex zeros come in conjugate pairs, so their product is positive.

therefore, option c is always positive or zero (but zeros can't be non-real if they are zero, but zeros can be real or non-real).

wait, zeros can be zero, but if they are non-real, their product is positive.

option b is 
d
d, which could be positive or negative.

option a is 
p
(
−
1
)
p(−1), which could be anything.

option d is 
p
(
1
)
p(1), which could be anything.

option e is the sum of real zeros, which could be positive or negative.

so, among these, option c is always positive (assuming there are non-real zeros; if all zeros are real, then product of non-real zeros is 1).

option b could be negative.

option d could be negative.

option e could be negative.

option a could be negative.

so, it's possible that 
d
d is negative, making option b smaller than option c.

similarly, 
p
(
−
1
)
p(−1) or 
p
(
1
)
p(1) could be negative.

option e could be negative.

so, none of these are necessarily the smallest.

perhaps the smallest is the product of the zeros, which is 
d
d, if 
d
d is negative.

but without knowing 
d
d, i can't be sure.

alternatively, maybe the sum of the coefficients, 
p
(
1
)
p(1), is always greater than or equal to something.

this is not helping.

wait, perhaps i should look at specific properties.

option d, the sum of the coefficients, is 
p
(
1
)
p(1).

option a is 
p
(
−
1
)
p(−1).

option b is 
d
d, the constant term.

option c is the product of non-real zeros.

option e is the sum of real zeros.

maybe i can consider the relationship between these.

alternatively, perhaps there is a relationship between 
p
(
1
)
p(1), 
p
(
−
1
)
p(−1), and the coefficients that could help.

but i'm stuck.

let me consider that the smallest among these could be the product of the zeros, which is 
d
d, if 
d
d is negative.

alternatively, perhaps 
p
(
−
1
)
p(−1) is the smallest.

but without specific values, it's hard to tell.

wait, perhaps i can consider that the sum of the coefficients is 
p
(
1
)
p(1), and for a polynomial with positive coefficients, 
p
(
1
)
p(1) would be positive, but here the coefficients can be negative.

this is not helping.

maybe i need to consider specific examples.

suppose the polynomial is 
p
(
x
)
=
x

−

x

−

x

+
0
x
+
d
p(x)=x

 −3x

then, 
p
(
1
)
=

−

−
3
+
0
+
d
=
−

+

p(1)=1−2−3+0+d=−4+d

1
+
2
−
3
+
0
+
d

d
p(−1)=1+2−3+0+d=0+d

the product of zeros is 
d
d.

the product of non-real zeros depends on the zeros.

the sum of real zeros depends on the zeros.

this isn't helping.

perhaps i need to look back at the asymptote code.

the function is:

perhaps there's a scaling factor involved.

alternatively, maybe the asymptote code is just to draw the graph, and the actual polynomial is different.

this is confusing.

maybe i should proceed without relying on the asymptote code.

alternatively, perhaps i can assume that the polynomial given in the asymptote code is 
p

p(x), and work with that.

 d=d.

therefore, the product of the zeros is 
21.6
21.6.

**option c: the product of the non-real zeros of 
p
p**

assuming there are non-real zeros, their product would be positive, as they come in conjugate pairs. however, without knowing the exact zeros, it's hard to determine the exact value.

but since the product of all zeros is 
21.6
21.6, and the product of the real zeros is part of this, the product of the non-real zeros would be 
21.6
product of real zeros
product of real zeros
21.6
​
 .

if there are two real zeros and two non-real zeros, then the product of the non-real zeros is 
21.6
product of real zeros
product of real zeros
21.6
​
 .

without knowing the real zeros, this is still unclear.

p(1)=0.125−0.333−0.75+2.7

=

=−0.208+1.95
=
1.742
=1.742
so, the sum of the coefficients is approximately 
1.742
1.742.

**option e: the sum of the real zeros of 
p
p**

from vieta's formula, the sum of all zeros is 
8

8
​
  (since 
−

=

(
−

)
=

−a=−(− 
3
8
​
 )=

8
​
 ).

if there are two real zeros and two non-real zeros, the sum of the real zeros is 
8
3
−
(
sum of non-real zeros
)
3
8
​
 −(sum of non-real zeros).

the sum of non-real zeros comes in conjugate pairs, so their sum is , where 
α
α is a non-real zero.

therefore, the sum of real zeros is .

without knowing , it's hard to determine this sum.

alternatively, if all zeros are real, then the sum is 
8
3
3
8
​
 , which is approximately 
2.666
2.666.

comparing the computed values:

- option a: 
p
(
−
1
)
≈
2.408
p(−1)≈2.408

- option b: product of zeros 
=
21.6
=21.6

- option d: sum of coefficients 
≈
1.742
≈1.742

- option e: if all zeros are real, sum is 
≈
2.666
≈2.666; if not, it depends on 

- option c: product of non-real zeros, which if there are non-real zeros, is positive, but could be less than 21.6 depending on the real zeros.

from the above, option d, the sum of the coefficients, is approximately 
1.742
1.742, which is smaller than option a (
2.408
2.408) and option e (
2.666
2.666 if all zeros are real).

option b is 
21.6
21.6, which is larger.

option c, if there are non-real zeros, would be 
21.6
product of real zeros
product of real zeros
21.6
​
 . if the product of real zeros is greater than 1, this would be less than 21.6, but without knowing the real zeros, it's hard to say.

wait, if there are two real zeros, their product is 
21.6
product of non-real zeros
product of non-real zeros
21.6
​
 . actually, i'm getting confused.

alternatively, perhaps i should consider that if there are non-real zeros, their product is greater than 0, and since the product of all zeros is 
21.6
21.6, the product of non-real zeros is 
21.6
product of real zeros
product of real zeros
21.6
​
 .

if the product of real zeros is greater than 1, then the product of non-real zeros is less than 21.6.

but without knowing the exact product of real zeros, i can't determine this precisely.

however, from the computed values, option d is approximately 
1.742
1.742, which is smaller than option a and e.

option c could be smaller than option d if the product of non-real zeros is less than 
1.742
1.742, but without specific values, it's uncertain.

alternatively, perhaps the smallest is option d, the sum of the coefficients.

but the question asks for which is the smallest among the options, and option d seems to be smaller than some others, but i need to be sure.

alternatively, maybe option e could be smaller if the sum of real zeros is less than 
1.742
1.742, but in the case where all zeros are real, it's 
2.666
2.666, which is larger than option d.

if there are non-real zeros, the sum of real zeros could be less than 
2.666
2.666, but without knowing, it's hard to say.

option c, the product of non-real zeros, if there are non-real zeros, could be smaller than option d, but again, without specific values, it's uncertain.

given this, perhaps option d is the smallest among the options provided.

therefore, i'll go with option d: the sum of the coefficients of 
p
p.
