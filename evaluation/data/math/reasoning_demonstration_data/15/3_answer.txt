Answer: Given the quartic polynomial \( p(x) = x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d \), we need to determine which of the following is the smallest:

a. \( p(-1) \)
b. the product of the zeros of \( p \)
c. the product of the non-real zeros of \( p \)
d. the sum of the coefficients of \( p \)
e. the sum of the real zeros of \( p \)

we start by analyzing each option:

**option a: \( p(-1) \)**

\[ p(-1) = 1 - a + b - c + d \]

**option b: the product of the zeros of \( p \)**

the product of the zeros is \( d \).

**option c: the product of the non-real zeros of \( p \)**

if there are non-real zeros, they come in conjugate pairs, and their product is positive.

**option d: the sum of the coefficients of \( p \)**

the sum of the coefficients is \( p(1) = 1 + a + b + c + d \).

**option e: the sum of the real zeros of \( p \)**

the sum of the real zeros is \( -a \) minus the sum of the non-real zeros.

given the polynomial from the asymptote code:

\[ p(x) = \frac{1}{8}x^4 - \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{3}{4}x^2 + 2.7 \]

we compute:

**option a: \( p(-1) \)**

\[ p(-1) = \frac{1}{8}(1) - \frac{1}{3}(-1) - \frac{3}{4}(1) + 2.7 \]
\[ = 0.125 + 0.333 - 0.75 + 2.7 \]
\[ = 2.408 \]

**option b: the product of the zeros of \( p \)**

the product of the zeros is \( 21.6 \).

**option d: the sum of the coefficients of \( p \)**

\[ p(1) = \frac{1}{8}(1) - \frac{1}{3}(1) - \frac{3}{4}(1) + 2.7 \]
\[ = 0.125 - 0.333 - 0.75 + 2.7 \]
\[ = 1.742 \]

**option e: the sum of the real zeros of \( p \)**

the sum of all zeros is \( \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.666 \).

comparing the computed values:

- option a: \( p(-1) \approx 2.408 \)
- option b: product of zeros \( = 21.6 \)
- option d: sum of coefficients \( \approx 1.742 \)
- option e: if all zeros are real, sum is \( \approx 2.666 \)

the smallest value among these is the sum of the coefficients of \( p \).

therefore, the answer is:

\boxed{\text{d}}
