Answer: To determine how many perfect cubes lie between 100 and 900, we follow these steps:

1. **Find the smallest integer whose cube is greater than or equal to 100:**
   - \(4^3 = 64\) (too small)
   - \(5^3 = 125\) (greater than 100)

   So, the smallest integer is 5.

2. **Find the largest integer whose cube is less than or equal to 900:**
   - \(9^3 = 729\) (less than 900)
   - \(10^3 = 1000\) (too large)

   So, the largest integer is 9.

3. **List the integers from 5 to 9 and check their cubes:**
   - \(5^3 = 125\)
   - \(6^3 = 216\)
   - \(7^3 = 343\)
   - \(8^3 = 512\)
   - \(9^3 = 729\)

   All of these cubes fall within the range of 100 to 900.

4. **Count the integers:**
   There are 5 integers (5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), so there are 5 perfect cubes between 100 and 900.

**Answer:** There are 5 perfect cubes between 100 and 900.
