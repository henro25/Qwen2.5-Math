Answer: 1. **Calculate the total value of the dimes:**
   - Number of dimes: 50
   - Value per dime: $0.10
   - Total value of dimes: 50 * $0.10 = $5.00

2. **Calculate the total value of the quarters:**
   - Number of quarters: 20
   - Value per quarter: $0.25
   - Total value of quarters: 20 * $0.25 = $5.00

3. **Calculate the total value of all the money:**
   - Total value = Value of dimes + Value of quarters = $5.00 + $5.00 = $10.00

4. **Determine the percentage of the total value that is in quarters:**
   - Percentage = (Value of quarters / Total value) * 100
   - Percentage = ($5.00 / $10.00) * 100 = 50%

**Answer:** 50% of the value of your money is in quarters.
