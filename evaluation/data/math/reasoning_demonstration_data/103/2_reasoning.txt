Reasoning: So i have this problem about a sequence of points in the coordinate plane. the sequence is defined by this recursive formula:

(
a
n
+
1
,
b
n
+
1
)
=
(
3
a
n
−
b
n
,
3
b
n
+
a
n
)
(a 
n+1
​
 ,b 
n+1
​
 )=( 
3
​
 a 
n
​
 −b 
n
​
 , 
3
​
 b 
n
​
 +a 
n
​
 )
and i know that $(a_{100}, b_{100}) = (2, 4)$. i need to find $a_1 + b_1$ and express it using exponential notation.

first, i should understand what this recursive formula is doing. it seems like each new point $(a_{n+1}, b_{n+1})$ is being generated from the previous point $(a_n, b_n)$ using some linear transformation. maybe i can think of this as a matrix transformation.

let me define a vector $\mathbf{v}_n = \begin{pmatrix} a_n \\ b_n \end{pmatrix}$. then the recursive formula can be written as:

v
n
+
1
=
(
3
−
1
1
3
)
v
n
v 
n+1
​
 =( 
3
​
 
1
​
  
−1
3
​
 
​
 )v 
n
​
 
so, this is a linear transformation represented by the matrix $m = \begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{3} & -1 \\ 1 & \sqrt{3} \end{pmatrix}$.

now, since this transformation is applied repeatedly, i can express $\mathbf{v}_{100}$ in terms of $\mathbf{v}_1$:

v
100
=
m
99
v
1
v 
100
​
 =m 
99
 v 
1
​
 
but i know $\mathbf{v}_{100} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}$, so:

m
99
v
1
=
(
2
4
)
m 
99
 v 
1
​
 =( 
2
4
​
 )
to find $\mathbf{v}_1$, i need to find $m^{-99}$ and apply it to $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}$:

v
1
=
m
−
99
(
2
4
)
v 
1
​
 =m 
−99
 ( 
2
4
​
 )
but computing $m^{-99}$ directly seems complicated. maybe there's a better way to handle this.

let me consider diagonalizing the matrix $m$. if $m$ can be diagonalized, then raising it to a power becomes easier.

first, find the eigenvalues of $m$. the characteristic equation is:

det
⁡
(
m
−
λ
i
)
=
0
det(m−λi)=0
so,

det
⁡
(
3
−
λ
−
1

3
−
λ
)
=
(
3
−
λ
)
2
+

=
0
det(

​
 −λ

​
  
−1

​
 −λ
​
 )=(

​
 −λ) 
2
 +1=0
expanding:

(

λ
)
2
+
1
=
(

)
2
−
2

λ

λ

2

 ) 
2

​
 λ+λ 
2
 +1=3−2 
3
​
 λ+λ 
2
 +1=λ 
2
 −2 
3
​
 λ+4=0
using the quadratic formula:

λ
=
2
3
±
(
2

)
2
−
16
2
=
2

​
 
​

​
 
​
 =

​
 ±i1
so, the eigenvalues are $\lambda = \sqrt{3} + i$ and $\lambda = \sqrt{3} - i$.

these are complex eigenvalues. since $m$ has complex eigenvalues, it might be easier to represent it in terms of rotation and scaling.

wait a minute, the matrix $m$ looks familiar. it resembles a rotation matrix combined with scaling.

a general rotation matrix is:

r
(
θ
)
=
(
cos
⁡
θ
−
sin
⁡
θ
sin
⁡
θ
cos
⁡
θ
)
r(θ)=( 
cosθ
sinθ
​
  
−sinθ
cosθ
​
 )
and if we have scaling by a factor $k$, then the transformation matrix would be:

k
r
(
θ
)
=
(
k
cos
⁡
θ
−
k
sin
⁡
θ
k
sin
⁡
θ
k
cos
⁡
θ
)
kr(θ)=( 
kcosθ
ksinθ
​
  
−ksinθ
kcosθ
​
 )
comparing this to our matrix $m$:

m
=
(
3
−
1
1
3
)
m=( 
3
​
 
1
​
  
−1
3
​
 
​
 )
i can see that if $k \cos \theta = \sqrt{3}$ and $k \sin \theta = 1$, then this matches.

so, solving for $k$ and $\theta$:

k
cos
⁡
θ
=
3
,
k
sin
⁡
θ
=
1
kcosθ= 
3
​
 ,ksinθ=1
then,

k
2
=
(
3
)
2
+
1
2
=
3
+
1
=
4
  
⟹
  
k
=
2
k 
2
 =( 
3
​
 ) 
2
 +1 
2
 =3+1=4⟹k=2
and,

cos
⁡
θ
=
3
2
,
sin
⁡
θ
=

2
  
⟹
  
θ
=

cosθ=

​
 
​
 ,sinθ=

​
 ⟹θ=30 
∘
  or  
6
π
​
  radians
so, $m = 2 r\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)$.

therefore, each application of $m$ scales the vector by 2 and rotates it by $\frac{\pi}{6}$ radians.

now, since $\mathbf{v}_{n+1} = m \mathbf{v}_n$, then:

v
n
=
m
n
−
1
v

v 
n
​
 =m 
n−1
 v

​
 
given that $\mathbf{v}_{100} = m^{99} \mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}$, i need to find $\mathbf{v}_1$.

but since $m = 2 r\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)$, then:

m
99
=
2
99
r
(
99
π
6
)
=
2
99
r
(
33
π

)
m 
99
 =2 
99
 r( 
6
99π
​
 )=2 
99
 r( 
2
33π
​
 )
simplify the rotation angle:

​
 =16π+

​
 =8×2π+

​
 
since rotations by multiples of $2\pi$ don't change the direction, this is equivalent to:

r
(
π
2
)
=
(
0
−
1
1
0
)
r( 
2

​
 )=(

​

​
 )
so,

m

=

r

=

(

99
 r(

therefore,

 (

so,

solving for $a_1$ and $b_1$:

from the second equation:

​
 =

​
 =2

from the first equation:

−
b

⟹
  
b

​
 =

99
 
2
​
 =2 
−98
 ⟹b

​
 =−2 
−98
 
now, i need to find $a_1 + b_1$:

a

b

=

(

−

​
 +b

​
 =2

 +(−2

let me factor out $2^{-98}$:

2
−
97
=
2
×
2
−
98
2 
−97
 =2×2 
−98
 
so,

a

=

 =(2−1)×2 
−98
 =1×2 
−98
 =2 
−98
 
wait, but the problem asks to express the answer using exponential notation. i have $2^{-98}$, which is already in exponential notation, but maybe i can write it as $e^{\ln 2^{-98}} = e^{-98 \ln 2}$.

but perhaps it's acceptable to leave it as $2^{-98}$.

alternatively, since $2^{-98} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{98}$, but $2^{-98}$ is simpler.

however, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of $e$, but $2^{-98}$ is already fine.

let me double-check my steps to ensure i didn't make any mistakes.

starting from:

m
99
v
1
=
(
2
4
)
m 
99
 v 
1
​
 =( 
2

​
 )
and $m^{99} = 2^{99} r\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)$, so:

2
99
(
0
−
1

0
)
(
a

)
=
(

−1
0
​
 )( 
a

​
 
b

​
 
​
 )=(

​
 )
which gives:

2
99
(
−
b

)
=
2
and
2
99
a
1
=
4
2 
99
 (−b

​
 )=2and2 
99
 a 
1
​
 =4
solving for $a_1$:

a
1
=

2
99
=
2
−
97
a 
1
​
 = 
2 
99
 
4
​
 =2 
−97
 
and for $b_1$:

−
b
1
=
2
2
99
=
2
−
98
  
⟹
  
b
1
=
−
2
−

−b

​
 = 
2 
99
 
2
​
 =2 
−98
 ⟹b 
1
​
 =−2 
−98
 
then:

a
1
+
b
1
=

−
97
−

−

=

−

​

 =2

 (2−1)=2

yes, that seems correct.

so, the final answer is $2^{-98}$.
