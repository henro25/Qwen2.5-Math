Problem: Circle $\Gamma$ is the incircle of $\triangle ABC$ and is also the circumcircle of $\triangle XYZ$.  The point $X$ is on $\overline{BC}$, the point $Y$ is on $\overline{AB}$, and the point $Z$ is on $\overline{AC}$.  If $\angle A=40^\circ$, $\angle B=60^\circ$, and $\angle C=80^\circ$, what is the measure of $\angle YZX$?
