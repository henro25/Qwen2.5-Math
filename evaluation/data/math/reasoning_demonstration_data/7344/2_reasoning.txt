Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: "let 
n
n be the sum of the divisors of 200. what is the largest prime factor of 
n
n?" okay, let's break this down step by step. i'm a bit rusty on some of these number theory concepts, but i think i can figure this out.

first, i need to find the sum of the divisors of 200. that means i need to list all the numbers that divide 200 evenly and then add them up. but that seems a bit tedious if i do it by listing them one by one. there must be a better way.

wait a minute, i remember something about the formula for the sum of divisors. i think it's related to the prime factorization of the number. yeah, if a number 
n
n has a prime factorization of 
n
=
p
1
a

×
p

a

⋯

 , then the sum of its divisors is given by:

so, first things first, i need to find the prime factorization of 200.

let's start by dividing 200 by the smallest prime, which is 2.

200 divided by 2 is 100.

100 divided by 2 is 50.

50 divided by 2 is 25.

25 divided by 2 doesn't work, so i move to the next prime, which is 5.

25 divided by 5 is 5.

5 divided by 5 is 1.

so, the prime factors are 2, 2, 2, 5, and 5.

therefore, the prime factorization of 200 is 
2
3
×
5
2
2 
3
 ×5 
2
 .

now, using the formula for the sum of divisors:

σ
(
200
)
=
(
1
+
2
+
2
2
+
2
3
)
×
(
1

+

2
)
σ(200)=(1+2+2 
2
 +2 
3
 )×(1+5+5 
2
 )
let's calculate each part separately.

first, 
1

2

=
15
1+2+4+8=15.

second, 
1
+
5
+
25
=
31
1+5+25=31.

now, multiply these two results together: 
15
×
31
=
465
15×31=465.

so, 
n
=
465
n=465.

now, i need to find the largest prime factor of 465.

to do that, i'll start by checking if 465 is divisible by the smallest primes and work my way up.

first, check if 465 is divisible by 2. since it's odd, it's not divisible by 2.

next, check 3. to check divisibility by 3, i can add the digits: 4 + 6 + 5 = 15, and 15 is divisible by 3, so 465 is divisible by 3.

let's divide 465 by 3: 465 ÷ 3 = 155.

so, 3 is a prime factor, and now i have 155 left.

next, check if 155 is divisible by 3. adding the digits: 1 + 5 + 5 = 11, which is not divisible by 3, so no.

next prime is 5. since 155 ends with a 5, it's divisible by 5.

155 ÷ 5 = 31.

so, 5 is another prime factor, and now i have 31 left.

31 is a prime number itself, so the prime factors of 465 are 3, 5, and 31.

among these, the largest prime factor is 31.

wait a second, is there a possibility i missed a larger prime factor? let's double-check.

465 divided by 3 is 155.

155 divided by 5 is 31.

31 is prime, so no further division is possible.

yes, i think that's correct.

so, the largest prime factor of 
n
=
465
n=465 is 31.

**final answer**

31
