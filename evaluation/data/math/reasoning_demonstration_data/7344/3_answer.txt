Answer: To solve the problem, we start by finding the sum of the divisors of 200. first, we determine the prime factorization of 200:

\[
200 = 2^3 \times 5^2
\]

using the formula for the sum of divisors, we have:

\[
\sigma(200) = (1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3) \times (1 + 5 + 5^2)
\]

calculating each part separately:

\[
1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15
\]
\[
1 + 5 + 25 = 31
\]

multiplying these results together:

\[
15 \times 31 = 465
\]

next, we find the largest prime factor of 465. we start by checking divisibility by the smallest primes:

\[
465 \div 3 = 155
\]
\[
155 \div 5 = 31
\]

since 31 is a prime number, the prime factors of 465 are 3, 5, and 31. therefore, the largest prime factor of 465 is:

\[
\boxed{31}
\]
