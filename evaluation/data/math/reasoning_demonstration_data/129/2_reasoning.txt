Reasoning: 
I have this problem here: the circle 
2
x
2
=
−
2
y
2
+
12
x
−
4
y
+
20
2x 
2
 =−2y 
2
 +12x−4y+20 is inscribed inside a square which has a pair of sides parallel to the x-axis. i need to find the area of the square.

first, i need to understand what it means for a circle to be inscribed in a square. if a circle is inscribed in a square, that means the circle touches all four sides of the square, and the square perfectly surrounds the circle. in this case, since the square has sides parallel to the x-axis, it's aligned with the coordinate axes, which should make things a bit easier.

to find the area of the square, i need to know the length of its sides. since the circle is inscribed, the diameter of the circle should be equal to the side length of the square. so, if i can find the diameter of the circle, i can find the side length of the square, and then square that to get the area.

but first, i need to find the diameter of the circle. to do that, i should find the standard form of the circle's equation. the given equation is 
2
x
2
=
−
2
y
2
+
12
x
−
4
y
+
20
2x 
2
 =−2y 
2
 +12x−4y+20. this doesn't look like the standard form of a circle equation, which is usually 
(
x
−
h
)
2
+
(
y
−
k
)
2
=
r
2
(x−h) 
2
 +(y−k) 
2
 =r 
2
 , where 
(
h
,
k
)
(h,k) is the center and 
r
r is the radius.

so, i need to rearrange and complete the squares for both x and y terms to get it into the standard form.

first, let me move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:

2
x
2
+
2
y
2
−
12
x
+
4
y
−
20
=
0
2x 
2
 +2y 
2
 −12x+4y−20=0

wait a second, i think i messed up the signs when moving terms. let me double-check:

original equation: 
2
x
2
=
−
2
y
2
+
12
x
−
4
y
+
20
2x 
2
 =−2y 
2
 +12x−4y+20

if i bring all terms to the left side:

2
x
2
+
2
y
2
−
12
x
+
4
y
−
20
=
0
2x 
2
 +2y 
2
 −12x+4y−20=0

yes, that's correct.

now, i can divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify it:

x
2
+
y
2
−
6
x
+
2
y
−
10
=
0
x 
2
 +y 
2
 −6x+2y−10=0

that looks better.

now, to complete the squares for x and y:

for the x terms: 
x
2
−
6
x
x 
2
 −6x

take half of -6, which is -3, and square it to get 9. so, 
x
2
−
6
x
+
9
=
(
x
−
3
)
2
x 
2
 −6x+9=(x−3) 
2
 

for the y terms: 
y
2
+
2
y
y 
2
 +2y

take half of 2, which is 1, and square it to get 1. so, 
y
2
+
2
y
+
1
=
(
y
+
1
)
2
y 
2
 +2y+1=(y+1) 
2
 

but i added 9 and 1 to complete the squares, so i need to add those to the other side as well to keep the equation balanced.

so, the equation becomes:

(
x
−
3
)
2
+
(
y
+
1
)
2
−
10
−
9
−
1
=
0
(x−3) 
2
 +(y+1) 
2
 −10−9−1=0

wait, let's see:

original simplified equation: 
x
2
+
y
2
−
6
x
+
2
y
−
10
=
0
x 
2
 +y 
2
 −6x+2y−10=0

after completing the squares:

(
x
−
3
)
2
−
9
+
(
y
+
1
)
2
−
1
−
10
=
0
(x−3) 
2
 −9+(y+1) 
2
 −1−10=0

wait, that doesn't seem right. let me try again.

starting from:

x
2
−
6
x
+
y
2
+
2
y
−
10
=
0
x 
2
 −6x+y 
2
 +2y−10=0

complete the square for x:

x
2
−
6
x
=
(
x
−
3
)
2
−
9
x 
2
 −6x=(x−3) 
2
 −9

complete the square for y:

y
2
+
2
y
=
(
y
+
1
)
2
−
1
y 
2
 +2y=(y+1) 
2
 −1

now, substitute back into the equation:

(
x
−
3
)
2
−
9
+
(
y
+
1
)
2
−
1
−
10
=
0
(x−3) 
2
 −9+(y+1) 
2
 −1−10=0

combine constants:

(
x
−
3
)
2
+
(
y
+
1
)
2
−
20
=
0
(x−3) 
2
 +(y+1) 
2
 −20=0

add 20 to both sides:

(
x
−
3
)
2
+
(
y
+
1
)
2
=
20
(x−3) 
2
 +(y+1) 
2
 =20

okay, now this is the standard form of the circle's equation. so, the center of the circle is at 
(
3
,
−
1
)
(3,−1), and the radius squared is 20, which means the radius 
r
=
20
=
2
5
r= 
20
​
 =2 
5
​
 .

since the circle is inscribed in the square, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square. the diameter is twice the radius, so:

diameter 
d
=
2
r
=
2
×
2
5
=
4
5
d=2r=2×2 
5
​
 =4 
5
​
 

therefore, the side length of the square is 
4
5
4 
5
​
 , and the area of the square is side length squared:

area 
a
=
(
4
5
)
2
=
16
×
5
=
80
a=(4 
5
​
 ) 
2
 =16×5=80

so, the area of the square is 80.

wait a minute, but let me double-check that. is there any step i might have missed or any mistake in the calculations?
