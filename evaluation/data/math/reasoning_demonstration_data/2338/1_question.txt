Problem: A roll of quarters contains $40$ quarters and a roll of dimes contains $50$ dimes. James has a jar that contains $83$ quarters and $159$ dimes.  Lindsay has a jar that contains $129$ quarters and $266$ dimes. James and Lindsay pool these quarters and dimes and make complete rolls with as many of the coins as possible.
