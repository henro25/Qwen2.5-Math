Answer: Given that a gasoline tank is \(\frac{7}{8}\) full and after using 12 gallons, it is half full, we need to find the total capacity of the tank when it is full.

let \( x \) be the total capacity of the tank in gallons. initially, the tank contains \(\frac{7}{8}x\) gallons. after using 12 gallons, the remaining amount is \(\frac{1}{2}x\) gallons. this gives us the equation:

\[
\frac{7}{8}x - 12 = \frac{1}{2}x
\]

to solve for \( x \), we first subtract \(\frac{1}{2}x\) from both sides:

\[
\frac{7}{8}x - \frac{1}{2}x = 12
\]

next, we find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{7}{8}x - \frac{4}{8}x = 12
\]

this simplifies to:

\[
\frac{3}{8}x = 12
\]

to isolate \( x \), we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{8}\):

\[
x = 12 \times \frac{8}{3} = 32
\]

thus, the total capacity of the tank when it is full is:

\[
\boxed{32}
\]
