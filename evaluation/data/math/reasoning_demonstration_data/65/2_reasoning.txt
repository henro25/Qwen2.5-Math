Reasoning: So i have this problem here. it says:

let 
f
:
c
→
c
f:c→c be defined by 
f
(
z
)
=
z
2
+
i
z
+
1
f(z)=z 
2
 +iz+1. how many complex numbers 
z
z are there such that 
im
(
z
)
>
0
im(z)>0 and both the real and the imaginary parts of 
f
(
z
)
f(z) are integers with absolute value at most 10?

alright, let's try to understand what this is asking. i need to find complex numbers 
z
z where the imaginary part of 
z
z is positive, and when i apply this function 
f
f to 
z
z, both the real and imaginary parts of the result are integers between -10 and 10, inclusive.

first, since 
z
z is a complex number, i can write it as 
z
=
x
+
i
y
z=x+iy, where 
x
x and 
y
y are real numbers, and 
y
>
0
y>0 because 
im
(
z
)
>
0
im(z)>0.

now, let's compute 
f
(
z
)
f(z):

f
(
z
)
=
z
2
+
i
z
+
1
f(z)=z 
2
 +iz+1

plugging in 
z
=
x
+
i
y
z=x+iy:

z
2
=
(
x
+
i
y
)
2
=
x
2
−
y
2
+
2
i
x
y
z 
2
 =(x+iy) 
2
 =x 
2
 −y 
2
 +2ixy

so,

f
(
z
)
=
(
x
2
−
y
2
+
2
i
x
y
)
+
i
(
x
+
i
y
)
+
1
f(z)=(x 
2
 −y 
2
 +2ixy)+i(x+iy)+1

let's simplify this step by step.

first, compute 
i
(
x
+
i
y
)
i(x+iy):

i
(
x
+
i
y
)
=
i
x
+
i
2
y
=
i
x
−
y
i(x+iy)=ix+i 
2
 y=ix−y (since 
i
2
=
−
1
i 
2
 =−1)

now, add all parts together:

f
(
z
)
=
(
x
2
−
y
2
)
+
2
i
x
y
+
i
x
−
y
+
1
f(z)=(x 
2
 −y 
2
 )+2ixy+ix−y+1

let's group the real and imaginary parts:

real part: 
x
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
x 
2
 −y 
2
 −y+1

imaginary part: 
2
x
y
+
x
2xy+x

so, 
f
(
z
)
=
(
x
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
)
+
i
(
2
x
y
+
x
)
f(z)=(x 
2
 −y 
2
 −y+1)+i(2xy+x)

now, the problem states that both the real and imaginary parts are integers with absolute value at most 10. that means:

x
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
x 
2
 −y 
2
 −y+1 is an integer, and 
∣
x
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
∣
≤
10
∣x 
2
 −y 
2
 −y+1∣≤10

similarly,

2
x
y
+
x
2xy+x is an integer, and 
∣
2
x
y
+
x
∣
≤
10
∣2xy+x∣≤10

additionally, 
y
>
0
y>0.

so, i need to find all real numbers 
x
x and 
y
y with 
y
>
0
y>0 such that both expressions above are integers within the specified range.

this seems a bit tricky because 
x
x and 
y
y are real numbers, and i need their combination to produce integer values for those expressions.

maybe i can treat 
x
x and 
y
y as variables and try to solve for them given that the real and imaginary parts are integers.

let me denote:

a
=
x
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
a=x 
2
 −y 
2
 −y+1

b
=
2
x
y
+
x
b=2xy+x

where 
a
a and 
b
b are integers with 
∣
a
∣
≤
10
∣a∣≤10 and 
∣
b
∣
≤
10
∣b∣≤10, and 
y
>
0
y>0.

i need to find the number of complex numbers 
z
=
x
+
i
y
z=x+iy satisfying these conditions.

perhaps i can consider 
a
a and 
b
b as parameters and try to solve for 
x
x and 
y
y in terms of 
a
a and 
b
b.

let me think about solving the system:

x
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
=
a
x 
2
 −y 
2
 −y+1=a

2
x
y
+
x
=
b
2xy+x=b

this is a system of two equations with two variables 
x
x and 
y
y. maybe i can solve for one variable in terms of the other.

let's look at the second equation:

2
x
y
+
x
=
b
2xy+x=b

factor out 
x
x:

x
(
2
y
+
1
)
=
b
x(2y+1)=b

so,

x
=
b
2
y
+
1
x= 
2y+1
b
​
  (assuming 
2
y
+
1
≠
0
2y+1

=0)

now, plug this expression for 
x
x into the first equation:

(
b
2
y
+
1
)
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
=
a
( 
2y+1
b
​
 ) 
2
 −y 
2
 −y+1=a

this seems a bit messy, but maybe i can simplify it.

let me compute 
(
b
2
y
+
1
)
2
( 
2y+1
b
​
 ) 
2
 :

b
2
(
2
y
+
1
)
2
(2y+1) 
2
 
b 
2
 
​
 

so, the equation becomes:

b
2
(
2
y
+
1
)
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
=
a
(2y+1) 
2
 
b 
2
 
​
 −y 
2
 −y+1=a

this looks complicated. maybe there's a better way to approach this.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider specific integer values for 
a
a and 
b
b within the given bounds and see what constraints they impose on 
x
x and 
y
y.

since 
a
a and 
b
b are integers with 
∣
a
∣
≤
10
∣a∣≤10 and 
∣
b
∣
≤
10
∣b∣≤10, there are 
21
×
21
=
441
21×21=441 possible pairs for 
(
a
,
b
)
(a,b). that's a lot, but maybe there's some symmetry or pattern i can exploit.

wait, perhaps i can consider that both 
a
a and 
b
b are integers, and try to find integer relationships between them that satisfy these equations.

alternatively, maybe i can consider that 
z
z is a root of the equation 
f
(
z
)
=
c
f(z)=c, where 
c
c is a complex number with integer real and imaginary parts within the specified range.

so, 
z
2
+
i
z
+
1
=
c
z 
2
 +iz+1=c

then, 
z
2
+
i
z
+
(
1
−
c
)
=
0
z 
2
 +iz+(1−c)=0

this is a quadratic equation in 
z
z, and for each 
c
c, i can solve for 
z
z.

the solutions are:

z
=
−
i
±
−
1
−
4
(
1
−
c
)
2
z= 
2
−i± 
−1−4(1−c)
​
 
​
 

wait, let's apply the quadratic formula correctly.

given 
z
2
+
i
z
+
(
1
−
c
)
=
0
z 
2
 +iz+(1−c)=0, the solutions are:

z
=
−
i
±
(
i
)
2
−
4
×
1
×
(
1
−
c
)
2
z= 
2
−i± 
(i) 
2
 −4×1×(1−c)
​
 
​
 

which simplifies to:

z
=
−
i
±
−
1
−
4
(
1
−
c
)
2
z= 
2
−i± 
−1−4(1−c)
​
 
​
 

simplify inside the square root:

−
1
−
4
+
4
c
=
−
5
+
4
c
−1−4+4c=−5+4c

so, 
z
=
−
i
±
−
5
+
4
c
2
z= 
2
−i± 
−5+4c
​
 
​
 

this seems complicated, especially since 
c
c is a complex number with integer real and imaginary parts.

maybe this approach isn't the most straightforward.

let me go back to the original expressions for the real and imaginary parts.

we have:

a
=
x
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
a=x 
2
 −y 
2
 −y+1

b
=
2
x
y
+
x
b=2xy+x

perhaps i can solve for 
y
y in terms of 
x
x and 
b
b, using the second equation.

from 
b
=
2
x
y
+
x
b=2xy+x, we have:

b
=
x
(
2
y
+
1
)
b=x(2y+1)

so,

x
=
b
2
y
+
1
x= 
2y+1
b
​
 

now, plug this into the first equation:

a
=
(
b
2
y
+
1
)
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
a=( 
2y+1
b
​
 ) 
2
 −y 
2
 −y+1

this still seems messy, but maybe i can consider that for each integer 
b
b, 
x
x is determined by 
y
y, and then see what constraints on 
y
y make 
a
a an integer within the bounds.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that 
x
x and 
y
y are real numbers, and try to find conditions under which both 
a
a and 
b
b are integers.

this seems quite involved. maybe there's a smarter way to approach this problem.

wait, perhaps i can consider that 
z
z lies in the upper half-plane (
im
(
z
)
>
0
im(z)>0), and 
f
(
z
)
f(z) maps 
z
z to a lattice point in the complex plane with integer real and imaginary parts between -10 and 10.

so, i can think of 
f
(
z
)
f(z) as mapping points from the upper half-plane to a grid of points with integer coordinates within a square of side 20 centered at the origin.

perhaps i can visualize this mapping and see how many pre-images there are for each lattice point in this grid.

but that might not be straightforward either.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider 
f
(
z
)
f(z) as a function and see if it is invertible, or if it has some symmetry that can help me count the number of solutions.

let me think differently. since 
z
z is a complex number, and 
f
(
z
)
f(z) is a quadratic polynomial in 
z
z, maybe i can consider the function 
f
f as a mapping and see how it transforms regions in the complex plane.

however, that might be too abstract for this problem.

let me try to look for patterns or possible simplifications.

first, note that 
f
(
z
)
=
z
2
+
i
z
+
1
f(z)=z 
2
 +iz+1. this is a quadratic function, so it's a polynomial of degree 2.

the fundamental theorem of algebra tells me that for each 
c
c, the equation 
f
(
z
)
=
c
f(z)=c has two solutions in 
c
c, unless the discriminant is zero, in which case there is one repeated root.

but in this problem, i'm not fixing 
c
c; instead, i'm considering all 
c
c with integer real and imaginary parts within certain bounds.

this seems complicated.

maybe instead of trying to solve for 
z
z in terms of 
a
a and 
b
b, i can consider the constraints imposed by the conditions on 
a
a and 
b
b.

let's consider that 
a
=
x
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
a=x 
2
 −y 
2
 −y+1 and 
b
=
2
x
y
+
x
b=2xy+x.

i can try to express 
y
y in terms of 
x
x and 
b
b, as i did earlier: 
y
=
b
−
x
2
x
y= 
2x
b−x
​
 , assuming 
x
≠
0
x

=0.

wait, from 
b
=
2
x
y
+
x
b=2xy+x, we have 
b
=
x
(
2
y
+
1
)
b=x(2y+1), so 
2
y
+
1
=
b
x
2y+1= 
x
b
​
 , assuming 
x
≠
0
x

=0.

then, 
y
=
b
2
x
−
1
2
y= 
2x
b
​
 − 
2
1
​
 

now, plug this into the expression for 
a
a:

a
=
x
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
a=x 
2
 −y 
2
 −y+1

substitute 
y
y:

a
=
x
2
−
(
b
2
x
−
1
2
)
2
−
(
b
2
x
−
1
2
)
+
1
a=x 
2
 −( 
2x
b
​
 − 
2
1
​
 ) 
2
 −( 
2x
b
​
 − 
2
1
​
 )+1

this looks really messy. maybe there's a better way.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that both 
a
a and 
b
b are integers, and try to find possible integer values of 
a
a and 
b
b that satisfy the equations for some real 
x
x and 
y
y with 
y
>
0
y>0.

but that seems too broad.

wait, perhaps i can consider the problem geometrically. since 
z
z is in the upper half-plane, and 
f
(
z
)
f(z) maps it to a lattice point with integer coordinates within a certain range, maybe i can think about how 
f
(
z
)
f(z) transforms regions of the plane.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that 
f
(
z
)
f(z) is a polynomial, so it's an entire function, and think about its image over the upper half-plane.

but that might not help directly in counting the number of solutions.

let me try a different approach.

suppose i fix 
a
a and 
b
b, integers with 
∣
a
∣
,
∣
b
∣
≤
10
∣a∣,∣b∣≤10, and try to solve for 
x
x and 
y
y.

from the earlier equations:

a
=
x
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
a=x 
2
 −y 
2
 −y+1

b
=
2
x
y
+
x
b=2xy+x

i can try to solve this system for 
x
x and 
y
y.

from the second equation, 
b
=
x
(
2
y
+
1
)
b=x(2y+1), so 
x
=
b
2
y
+
1
x= 
2y+1
b
​
 , provided 
2
y
+
1
≠
0
2y+1

=0.

now, substitute this into the first equation:

a
=
(
b
2
y
+
1
)
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
a=( 
2y+1
b
​
 ) 
2
 −y 
2
 −y+1

this is an equation in 
y
y only, given 
a
a and 
b
b.

this seems complicated, but perhaps i can rearrange it.

let me denote 
d
=
2
y
+
1
d=2y+1, so 
y
=
d
−
1
2
y= 
2
d−1
​
 

then, 
x
=
b
d
x= 
d
b
​
 

now, substitute 
y
y into the first equation:

a
=
x
2
−
(
d
−
1
2
)
2
−
(
d
−
1
2
)
+
1
a=x 
2
 −( 
2
d−1
​
 ) 
2
 −( 
2
d−1
​
 )+1

substitute 
x
=
b
d
x= 
d
b
​
 :

a
=
(
b
d
)
2
−
(
d
−
1
2
)
2
−
(
d
−
1
2
)
+
1
a=( 
d
b
​
 ) 
2
 −( 
2
d−1
​
 ) 
2
 −( 
2
d−1
​
 )+1

this is still messy, but perhaps i can multiply both sides by 
d
2
d 
2
  to eliminate denominators.

a
d
2
=
b
2
−
(
d
−
1
2
)
2
d
2
−
(
d

)
d

+
d
2
ad 
2

2
 −( 
2
d−1
​
 ) 
2
 d 
2
 −( 
2
d−1
​
 )d 
2
 +d 
2
 

wait, that doesn't seem helpful. maybe i need to find a better substitution.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider solving for 
y
y in terms of 
a
a and 
b
b, and then see what constraints that imposes.

this is getting too complicated. maybe there's a smarter way to approach this problem.

let me try to consider specific values for 
a
a and 
b
b and see what happens.

suppose 
a
=
0
a=0 and 
b
=
0
b=0. then, the equations become:

x
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
=
0
x 
2
 −y 
2
 −y+1=0

2
x
y
+
x
=
0
2xy+x=0

from the second equation, 
x
(
2
y
+
1
)
=
0
x(2y+1)=0, so either 
x
=
0
x=0 or 
y
=
−
1
2
y=− 
2
1
​
 .

but 
y
>
0
y>0, so 
y
=
−
1
2
y=− 
2
1
​
  is not allowed. hence, 
x
=
0
x=0.

plugging 
x
=
0
x=0 into the first equation:

0
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
=
0
0−y 
2
 −y+1=0

so, 
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
=
0
−y 
2
 −y+1=0, or 
y
2
+
y
−
1
=
0
y 
2
 +y−1=0

solutions are 
y
=
−
1
±
1
+
4
2
=
−
1
±
5
2
y= 
2
−1± 
1+4
​
 
​
 = 
2
−1± 
5
​
 
​
 

since 
y
>
0
y>0, 
y
=
−
1
+
5
2
y= 
2
−1+ 
5
​
 
​
 , which is approximately 0.618.

so, for 
a
=
0
a=0 and 
b
=
0
b=0, there is one solution with 
y
>
0
y>0.

similarly, for other values of 
a
a and 
b
b, i can try to find solutions.

but doing this for all 441 possible pairs of 
a
a and 
b
b would be time-consuming.

i need a better strategy.

perhaps i can consider that 
f
(
z
)
=
z
2
+
i
z
+
1
f(z)=z 
2
 +iz+1 can be rewritten in terms of 
z
z and its conjugate, but since 
z
z is in the upper half-plane, its conjugate is not necessarily related in a simple way.

alternatively, maybe i can consider the function 
f
(
z
)
f(z) and see if it can be inverted or if it has some symmetry that allows me to count the number of solutions more easily.

wait, perhaps i can consider that 
f
(
z
)
f(z) is a polynomial of degree 2, so for each 
c
c, there are two solutions 
z
z to 
f
(
z
)
=
c
f(z)=c, unless the discriminant is zero.

but again, since 
c
c is varying over a grid of points, this doesn't immediately help.

let me try to consider the real and imaginary parts again.

we have:

a
=
x
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
a=x 
2
 −y 
2
 −y+1

b
=
2
x
y
+
x
b=2xy+x

i can consider these as two equations in 
x
x and 
y
y, and try to solve for 
x
x and 
y
y in terms of 
a
a and 
b
b.

from the second equation, 
b
=
x
(
2
y
+
1
)
b=x(2y+1), so 
x
=
b
2
y
+
1
x= 
2y+1
b
​
 , provided 
2
y
+
1
≠
0
2y+1

=0.

now, plug this into the first equation:

a
=
(
b
2
y
+
1
)
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
a=( 
2y+1
b
​
 ) 
2
 −y 
2
 −y+1

this is an equation in 
y
y only, given 
a
a and 
b
b.

let me denote 
d
=
2
y
+
1
d=2y+1, so 
y
=
d
−
1
2
y= 
2
d−1
​
 

then, 
x
=
b
d
x= 
d
b
​
 

now, substitute 
y
=
d
−
1
2
y= 
2
d−1
​
  into the equation for 
a
a:

a
=
(
b
d
)
2
−
(
d
−
1
2
)
2
−
(
d
−
1
2
)
+
1
a=( 
d
b
​
 ) 
2
 −( 
2
d−1
​
 ) 
2
 −( 
2
d−1
​
 )+1

simplify each term:

(
b
d
)
2
=
b
2
d
2
( 
d
b
​
 ) 
2
 = 
d 
2
 
b 
2
 
​
 

(
d
−
1
2
)
2
=
(
d
−
1
)
2
4
( 
2
d−1
​
 ) 
2
 = 
4
(d−1) 
2
 
​
 

(
d
−
1
2
)
=
d
−
1
2
( 
2
d−1
​
 )= 
2
d−1
​
 

so, the equation becomes:

a
=
b
2
d
2
−
(
d
−
1
)
2
4
−
d
−
1
2
+
1
a= 
d 
2
 
b 
2
 
​
 − 
4
(d−1) 
2
 
​
 − 
2
d−1
​
 +1

this is still quite complicated. maybe i can multiply both sides by 
4
d
2
4d 
2
  to eliminate denominators:

4
a
d
2
=
4
b
2
−
(
d
−
1
)
2
d
2
−
2
(
d
−
1
)
d
2
+
4
d
2
4ad 
2
 =4b 
2
 −(d−1) 
2
 d 
2
 −2(d−1)d 
2
 +4d 
2
 

this seems even more complicated. perhaps this substitution isn't helping.

let me try a different approach.

suppose i consider 
z
=
x
+
i
y
z=x+iy, with 
y
>
0
y>0, and 
f
(
z
)
=
a
+
i
b
f(z)=a+ib, where 
a
a and 
b
b are integers with 
∣
a
∣
,
∣
b
∣
≤
10
∣a∣,∣b∣≤10.

then, 
f
(
z
)
=
z
2
+
i
z
+
1
=
(
x
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
)
+
i
(
2
x
y
+
x
)
=
a
+
i
b
f(z)=z 
2
 +iz+1=(x 
2
 −y 
2
 −y+1)+i(2xy+x)=a+ib

so, i have the system:

1. 
x
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
=
a
x 
2
 −y 
2
 −y+1=a

2. 
2
x
y
+
x
=
b
2xy+x=b

i can try to solve this system for 
x
x and 
y
y in terms of 
a
a and 
b
b.

from equation 2, 
x
(
2
y
+
1
)
=
b
x(2y+1)=b, so 
x
=
b
2
y
+
1
x= 
2y+1
b
​
 , assuming 
2
y
+
1
≠
0
2y+1

=0.

now, plug this into equation 1:

(
b
2
y
+
1
)
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
=
a
( 
2y+1
b
​
 ) 
2
 −y 
2
 −y+1=a

this gives an equation in 
y
y only, given 
a
a and 
b
b.

this seems complicated, but perhaps i can treat 
y
y as a variable and try to solve for it.

alternatively, maybe i can consider that 
y
y must be such that 
2
y
+
1
2y+1 divides 
b
b, but since 
y
y is a real number, this might not be directly useful.

this is getting too involved. maybe i need to consider numerical methods or look for bounds on 
x
x and 
y
y.

given that 
a
a and 
b
b are bounded, perhaps i can find bounds on 
x
x and 
y
y as well.

from equation 2, 
b
=
x
(
2
y
+
1
)
b=x(2y+1), and 
∣
b
∣
≤
10
∣b∣≤10, so 
∣
x
(
2
y
+
1
)
∣
≤
10
∣x(2y+1)∣≤10.

similarly, from equation 1, 
a
=
x
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
a=x 
2
 −y 
2
 −y+1, and 
∣
a
∣
≤
10
∣a∣≤10.

perhaps i can consider that 
x
2
x 
2
  is bounded by 
∣
a
∣
+
y
2
+
y
−
1
∣a∣+y 
2
 +y−1, but that doesn't immediately help.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that 
y
>
0
y>0, and try to find ranges for 
y
y that make 
a
a and 
b
b integers within the specified bounds.

this seems too vague. maybe i need to accept that this problem is quite challenging and try to look for a smarter approach.

wait, perhaps i can consider that 
f
(
z
)
=
z
2
+
i
z
+
1
f(z)=z 
2
 +iz+1 can be expressed in terms of 
z
z and its complex conjugate, but since 
z
z is in the upper half-plane, its conjugate is related to it.

however, this might not be the best way forward.

alternatively, maybe i can consider that 
f
(
z
)
f(z) is a polynomial and think about its critical points or other properties, but that seems unrelated to the problem at hand.

perhaps i should consider that for each 
c
=
a
+
i
b
c=a+ib, the equation 
f
(
z
)
=
c
f(z)=c has two solutions in 
c
c, and count how many of these solutions lie in the upper half-plane and map to 
c
c with integer real and imaginary parts within the specified bounds.

but again, this seems too broad.

let me try to think differently. suppose i fix 
a
a and 
b
b, and solve for 
z
z in the equation 
f
(
z
)
=
a
+
i
b
f(z)=a+ib.

so, 
z
2
+
i
z
+
1
=
a
+
i
b
z 
2
 +iz+1=a+ib

rearranging, 
z
2
+
i
z
+
(
1
−
a
−
i
b
)
=
0
z 
2
 +iz+(1−a−ib)=0

this is a quadratic equation in 
z
z, and its solutions are:

z
=
−
i
±
−
1
−
4
(
1
−
a
−
i
b
)
2
z= 
2
−i± 
−1−4(1−a−ib)
​
 
​
 

simplify the discriminant:

−
1
−
4
(
1
−
a
−
i
b
)
=
−
1
−
4
+
4
a
+
4
i
b
=
−
5
+
4
a
+
4
i
b
−1−4(1−a−ib)=−1−4+4a+4ib=−5+4a+4ib

so, 
z
=
−
i
±
−
5
+
4
a
+
4
i
b
2
z= 
2
−i± 
−5+4a+4ib
​
 
​
 

this still seems too complicated to work with directly.

maybe instead of trying to solve for 
z
z in terms of 
a
a and 
b
b, i can consider properties of 
f
(
z
)
f(z) that might help me count the number of solutions.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that 
f
(
z
)
f(z) is a quadratic polynomial and use some properties of quadratic functions to find the number of pre-images for each 
c
c in the specified grid.

but i'm not sure how to proceed with that.

let me try to consider specific values of 
a
a and 
b
b again to see if i can find a pattern.

suppose 
a
=
1
a=1 and 
b
=
0
b=0.

then, the equations become:

x
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
=
1
x 
2
 −y 
2
 −y+1=1

2
x
y
+
x
=
0
2xy+x=0

from the second equation, 
x
(
2
y
+
1
)
=
0
x(2y+1)=0, so 
x
=
0
x=0 or 
y
=
−
1
2
y=− 
2
1
​
 . but 
y
>
0
y>0, so 
x
=
0
x=0.

plugging 
x
=
0
x=0 into the first equation:

0
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
=
1
0−y 
2
 −y+1=1, so 
−
y
2
−
y
=
0
−y 
2
 −y=0, which implies 
y
(
y
+
1
)
=
0
y(y+1)=0. thus, 
y
=
0
y=0 or 
y
=
−
1
y=−1. but 
y
>
0
y>0, so no solution in this case.

interesting, so for 
a
=
1
a=1 and 
b
=
0
b=0, there are no solutions.

let's try 
a
=
1
a=1 and 
b
=
1
b=1.

then, the equations are:

x
2
−
y
2
−
y
+
1
=
1
x 
2
 −y 
2
 −y+1=1

2
x
y
+
x
=
1
2xy+x=1

from the first equation:

x
2
−
y
2
−
y
=
0
x 
2
 −y 
2
 −y=0, so 
x
2
=
y
2
+
y
x 
2
 =y 
2
 +y

from the second equation:

x
(
2
y
+
1
)
=
1
x(2y+1)=1, so 
x
=
1
2
y
+
1
x= 
2y+1
1
​
 

now, substitute 
x
x into the first equation:

(
1
2
y
+
1
)
2
=
y
2
+
y
( 
2y+1
1
​
 ) 
2
 =y 
2
 +y

so,

1
(
2
y
+
1
)
2
=
y
2
+
y
(2y+1) 
2
 
1
​
 =y 
2
 +y

this is an equation in 
y
y that i can try to solve.

multiply both sides by 
(
2
y
+
1
)
2
(2y+1) 
2
 :

1
=
(
y
2
+
y
)
(
2
y
+
1
)
2
1=(y 
2
 +y)(2y+1) 
2
 

expand 
(
2
y
+
1
)
2
(2y+1) 
2
 :

(
2
y
+
1
)
2
=
4
y
2
+
4
y
+
1
(2y+1) 
2
 =4y 
2
 +4y+1

so,

1
=
(
y
2
+
y
)
(
4
y
2
+
4
y
+
1
)
1=(y 
2
 +y)(4y 
2
 +4y+1)

expand the right-hand side:

y
2
(
4
y
2
+
4
y
+
1
)
+
y
(
4
y
2

)
=

2
 +4y 
3
 +4y 
2
 +y=4y

so, the equation is:

this is a quartic equation, which might be difficult to solve analytically. perhaps i can look for rational roots using the rational root theorem.

not a root.

this suggests that there are no rational solutions for 
y
y in this case, and i might need to use numerical methods to approximate the solutions. however, since this is a theoretical problem, i probably don't need exact values but rather a way to count the number of solutions.

this is getting too time-consuming, and i'm not making much progress.

perhaps i should consider that for each integer pair 
(
a
,
b
)
(a,b), there are either 0, 1, or 2 solutions 
z
z in the upper half-plane, depending on the discriminant of the quadratic equation 
f
(
z
)
=
a
+
i
b
f(z)=a+ib.

given that 
f
(
z
)
f(z) is a quadratic polynomial, each equation 
f
(
z
)
=
c
f(z)=c has two solutions in 
c
c, unless the discriminant is zero.

however, i need to consider only those solutions where 
im
(
z
)
>
0
im(z)>0.

moreover, since the problem specifies that both real and imaginary parts of 
f
(
z
)
f(z) are integers with absolute value at most 10, there are a finite number of such 
c
=
a
+
i
b
c=a+ib to consider.

specifically, there are 
21
×
21
=
441
21×21=441 possible pairs for 
(
a
,
b
)
(a,b) since 
a
,
b
a,b are integers with 
∣
a
∣
,
∣
b
∣
≤
10
∣a∣,∣b∣≤10.

for each such 
c
c, the equation 
f
(
z
)
=
c
f(z)=c has two solutions in 
c
c, unless the discriminant is zero, in which case there is one solution with multiplicity two.

now, for each 
c
c, i need to determine how many of its two solutions lie in the upper half-plane (
im
(
z
)
>
0
im(z)>0).

in general, for a quadratic equation with complex coefficients, the solutions can lie anywhere in the complex plane, and there's no guarantee about their imaginary parts.

however, in this specific case, since 
f
(
z
)
f(z) is a quadratic polynomial, perhaps there is some symmetry or property that can be exploited to count the number of solutions in the upper half-plane.

alternatively, maybe i can consider that for each 
c
c, exactly one of the two solutions lies in the upper half-plane, assuming that the coefficients of the polynomial don't cause both solutions to lie on the real axis or something like that.

if that's the case, then for each of the 441 possible 
c
c, there would be one solution in the upper half-plane, giving a total of 441 such 
z
z.

however, i need to verify if this is indeed the case.

first, consider that 
f
(
z
)
=
z
2
+
i
z
+
1
f(z)=z 
2
 +iz+1 is a quadratic polynomial, so for each 
c
c, the equation 
f
(
z
)
=
c
f(z)=c has two solutions in 
c
c.

now, consider the complex conjugate of 
z
z, denoted 
z
‾
z
 .

if 
z
z is a solution to 
f
(
z
)
=
c
f(z)=c, then 
f
(
z
)
‾
=
c
‾
f(z)
​
 = 
c
 , but 
f
(
z
‾
)
=
z
‾
2
+
i
z
‾
+
1
f( 
z
 )= 
z
  
2
 +i 
z
 +1, which is not necessarily equal to 
c
‾
c
 , because of the 
i
z
‾
i 
z
  term.

therefore, the roots of 
f
(
z
)
=
c
f(z)=c are not necessarily related by complex conjugation, unlike in the case of real coefficients.

this means that both solutions could lie in the upper half-plane, or one in the upper and one in the lower, or both on the real axis, depending on 
c
c.

given this, i can't assume that exactly one solution lies in the upper half-plane for each 
c
c.

therefore, i need a different approach to count the number of solutions with 
im
(
z
)
>
0
im(z)>0.

perhaps i can consider the behavior of 
f
(
z
)
f(z) on the boundary of the upper half-plane, or use some properties of analytic functions to determine the number of pre-images in the upper half-plane.

alternatively, maybe i can consider that the mapping 
f
(
z
)
f(z) is a branched covering of degree 2 from the complex plane to itself, and use the argument principle or some other tool from complex analysis to count the number of solutions in the upper half-plane.

however, this seems too advanced for the current context.

let me try to think of it in terms of counting.

suppose that for each 
c
c with integer real and imaginary parts within the specified bounds, there are two solutions to 
f
(
z
)
=
c
f(z)=c, and that these solutions are distinct (i.e., the discriminant is not zero).

then, in total, there would be 
441
×
2
=
882
441×2=882 solutions in 
c
c.

now, since 
f
(
z
)
f(z) maps the upper half-plane to some region in 
c
c, and the lower half-plane to its complex conjugate region, perhaps there is a symmetry that allows me to say that half of these solutions lie in the upper half-plane.

if that were the case, then the total number of solutions with 
im
(
z
)
>
0
im(z)>0 would be approximately half of 882, which is 441.

however, this is a very rough estimate and may not be accurate, especially near the real axis where solutions could lie exactly on the boundary.

moreover, i need to account for cases where the discriminant is zero, leading to repeated roots, and ensure that i'm not overcounting or undercounting such cases.

alternatively, perhaps there is a one-to-one correspondence between solutions in the upper and lower half-planes, meaning that the number of solutions with 
im
(
z
)
>
0
im(z)>0 is equal to the number with 
im
(
z
)
<
0
im(z)<0.

if that's the case, then the number of solutions in the upper half-plane would indeed be half of the total number of distinct solutions.

given that, and assuming that the discriminant is not zero for any 
c
c in the specified range, then the total number of solutions in the upper half-plane would be 
441
441.

however, i need to verify if this assumption holds.

first, i need to check if the discriminant 
−
5
+
4
a
+
4
i
b
−5+4a+4ib is ever zero for 
a
a and 
b
b integers within 
∣
a
∣
,
∣
b
∣
≤
10
∣a∣,∣b∣≤10.

the discriminant is 
−
5
+
4
a
+
4
i
b
−5+4a+4ib.

for the discriminant to be zero, both the real and imaginary parts must be zero.

so,

−
5
+
4
a
=
0
−5+4a=0 and 
4
b
=
0
4b=0

solving these:

4
a
=
5
4a=5 implies 
a
=
5
4
a= 
4
5
​
 , which is not an integer, and 
b
=
0
b=0

therefore, there are no integer values of 
a
a and 
b
b within the specified bounds for which the discriminant is zero.

thus, for each 
c
=
a
+
i
b
c=a+ib, there are two distinct solutions 
z
z in 
c
c.

now, assuming that the solutions are symmetrically distributed with respect to the real axis, meaning that if 
z
z is a solution, then its complex conjugate 
z
‾
z
  is also a solution.

wait, but earlier i thought that might not be the case because of the 
i
z
iz term in 
f
(
z
)
f(z).

let me check this.

suppose 
z
z is a solution to 
f
(
z
)
=
c
f(z)=c, i.e., 
z
2
+
i
z
+
1
=
c
z 
2
 +iz+1=c

then, take the complex conjugate of both sides:

z
‾
2
−
i
z
‾
+
1
=
c
‾
z
  
2
 −i 
z
 +1= 
c
 

this is not the same as 
f
(
z
‾
)
f( 
z
 ), which would be 
z
‾
2
+
i
z
‾
+
1
z
  
2
 +i 
z
 +1

so, 
f
(
z
‾
)
=
z
‾
2
+
i
z
‾
+
1
f( 
z
 )= 
z
  
2
 +i 
z
 +1, which is not necessarily equal to 
c
‾
c
 .

therefore, unless 
c
c has specific properties, 
z
‾
z
  is not necessarily a solution to 
f
(
z
)
=
c
f(z)=c.

this means that the roots are not necessarily related by complex conjugation, and thus, their imaginary parts could both be positive, both negative, or one positive and one negative.

this complicates things because i can't assume a symmetry between the upper and lower half-planes in terms of the number of solutions.

given this, perhaps i need to consider that for each 
c
c, the two solutions could lie in any combination of the upper or lower half-planes.

to count the number of solutions in the upper half-plane, i need to find, for each 
c
c, how many of its two solutions have positive imaginary parts.

this seems challenging without a specific relationship between 
z
z and 
z
‾
z
 .

alternatively, perhaps i can consider integrating over the upper half-plane or using some other advanced technique from complex analysis, but that might be beyond the scope of this problem.

given the time constraints, maybe i should accept that the total number of solutions is 
441
441, assuming one solution per 
c
c in the upper half-plane.

however, this might not be accurate, as the actual number could be different.

alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is 
441
×
1
=
441
441×1=441, assuming one solution per 
c
c in the upper half-plane.

but i'm not entirely confident in this answer.

perhaps i should look for another way to approach the problem.

let me consider that 
f
(
z
)
=
z
2
+
i
z
+
1
f(z)=z 
2
 +iz+1, and think about it in terms of transformations.

first, consider 
z
2
z 
2
 , which is a standard quadratic mapping.

then, adding 
i
z
iz is like adding a linear term, and adding 1 is a constant shift.

this combination likely distorts the plane in a way that's not easily invertible without more advanced techniques.

given that, perhaps i should consider that for each 
c
c, there are two distinct solutions 
z
z, and without additional information, i can't determine exactly how many lie in the upper half-plane.

therefore, the safest assumption is that, on average, half of the solutions lie in the upper half-plane, leading to approximately 
441
441 solutions.

however, since the problem likely expects an exact answer, and my reasoning is not precise enough to provide that, perhaps i need to consider that the number of solutions is indeed 
441
441.

alternatively, maybe there are exactly two solutions for each 
c
c, and considering the upper half-plane, the total number is 
441
441.

but again, without a more precise method, i can't be certain.

given the complexity of the problem, i think i'll settle on 
441
441 as the number of complex numbers 
z
z satisfying the given conditions.

**final answer**

441
