Answer: Given the function \( f(z) = z^2 + iz + 1 \) and the conditions that \(\text{im}(z) > 0\) and both the real and imaginary parts of \( f(z) \) are integers with absolute value at most 10, we start by expressing \( z \) as \( x + iy \) where \( x \) and \( y \) are real numbers and \( y > 0 \).

we compute \( f(z) \) as follows:
\[
f(z) = (x + iy)^2 + i(x + iy) + 1 = (x^2 - y^2 + 2ixy) + (ix - y) + 1 = (x^2 - y^2 - y + 1) + i(2xy + x)
\]

thus, the real part is \( x^2 - y^2 - y + 1 \) and the imaginary part is \( 2xy + x \). both parts must be integers within the range \([-10, 10]\).

we denote:
\[
a = x^2 - y^2 - y + 1 \quad \text{and} \quad b = 2xy + x
\]
where \( a \) and \( b \) are integers with \( |a| \leq 10 \) and \( |b| \leq 10 \).

the system of equations is:
\[
a = x^2 - y^2 - y + 1
\]
\[
b = 2xy + x
\]

from the second equation, we solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{b}{2y + 1}
\]

substituting \( x \) into the first equation:
\[
a = \left( \frac{b}{2y + 1} \right)^2 - y^2 - y + 1
\]

this equation is complex to solve directly, so we consider the quadratic nature of \( f(z) \). for each \( c = a + ib \), the equation \( f(z) = c \) has two solutions in \( \mathbb{c} \). given the constraints on \( a \) and \( b \), there are \( 21 \times 21 = 441 \) possible pairs \((a, b)\).

assuming that for each \( c \), one solution lies in the upper half-plane, the total number of solutions with \(\text{im}(z) > 0\) is approximately half of the total solutions. however, detailed analysis shows that the discriminant is never zero for integer \( a \) and \( b \) within the given bounds, ensuring two distinct solutions for each \( c \).

thus, the number of complex numbers \( z \) such that \(\text{im}(z) > 0\) and both the real and imaginary parts of \( f(z) \) are integers with absolute value at most 10 is:

\[
\boxed{441}
\]
