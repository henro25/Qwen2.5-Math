Problem: "Modulo $m$ graph paper" consists of a grid of $m^2$ points, representing all pairs of integer residues $(x,y)$ where $0\le x<m$. To graph a congruence on modulo $m$ graph paper, we mark every point $(x,y)$ that satisfies the congruence. For example, a graph of $y\equiv x^2\pmod 5$ would consist of the points $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(2,4)$, $(3,4)$, and $(4,1)$.

The graphs of $$y\equiv 5x+2\pmod{16}$$and $$y\equiv 11x+12\pmod{16}$$on modulo $16$ graph paper have some points in common. What is the sum of the $x$-coordinates of those points?
