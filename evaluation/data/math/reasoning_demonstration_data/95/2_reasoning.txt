Reasoning: So i need to find the value of 
x
x in the equation 
log
⁡
x
32
=
5
2
log 
x
​
 32= 
2
5
​
 . okay, let's start by recalling what a logarithm means. the expression 
log
⁡
x
32
=
5
2
log 
x
​
 32= 
2
5
​
  means that 
x
x raised to the power of 
5
2
2
5
​
  equals 32. so, i can rewrite this equation in its exponential form.

that would be:

x
5
2
=
32
x 
2
5
​
 
 =32
now, i need to solve for 
x
x. to isolate 
x
x, i should get rid of the exponent 
5
2
2
5
​
 . i know that to undo an exponent, i can raise both sides of the equation to the reciprocal of that exponent. the reciprocal of 
5
2
2
5
​
  is 
2
5
5
2
​
 , so i'll raise both sides to the power of 
2
5
5
2
​
 .

let's do that:

(
x
5
2
)
2
5
=
3
2
2
5
(x 
2
5
​
 
 ) 
5
2
​
 
 =32 
5
2
​
 
 
simplifying the left side, the exponents 
5
2
2
5
​
  and 
2
5
5
2
​
  multiply to 1, so:

x
=
3
2
2
5
x=32 
5
2
​
 
 
now, i need to compute 
3
2
2
5
32 
5
2
​
 
 . i know that 
32
32 is a power of 
2
2, specifically 
32
=
2
5
32=2 
5
 . so, i can rewrite the expression as:

x
=
(
2
5
)
2
5
x=(2 
5
 ) 
5
2
​
 
 
when raising a power to another power, i multiply the exponents:

x
=
2
5
×
2
5
=
2
2
=
4
x=2 
5× 
5
2
​
 
 =2 
2
 =4
wait a minute, is that correct? let me double-check my steps to make sure i didn't make a mistake.

starting from:

log
⁡
x
32
=
5
2
log 
x
​
 32= 
2
5
​
 
which implies:

x
5
2
=
32
x 
2
5
​
 
 =32
raising both sides to 
2
5
5
2
​
 :

x
=
3
2
2
5
x=32 
5
2
​
 
 
since 
32
=
2
5
32=2 
5
 , then:

3
2
2
5
=
(
2
5
)
2
5
=
2
5
×
2
5
=
2
2
=
4
32 
5
2
​
 
 =(2 
5
 ) 
5
2
​
 
 =2 
5× 
5
2
​
 
 =2 
2
 =4
that seems consistent. but just to be thorough, maybe i can check by plugging 
x
=
4
x=4 back into the original logarithmic equation to see if it holds true.

so, plugging in:

log
⁡
4
32
=
5
2
log 
4
​
 32= 
2
5
​
 
let's verify if this is true. by definition, 
log
⁡
4
32
=
5
2
log 
4
​
 32= 
2
5
​
  means that:

4
5
2
=
32
4 
2
5
​
 
 =32
calculating 
4
5
2
4 
2
5
​
 
 :

first, 
4
1
2
=
2
4 
2
1
​
 
 =2, since the square root of 4 is 2.

then, 
2
5
=
32
2 
5
 =32, because 
2
×
2
×
2
×
2
×
2
=
32
2×2×2×2×2=32.

so, 
4
5
2
=
32
4 
2
5
​
 
 =32, which matches the original equation. therefore, 
x
=
4
x=4 is indeed the correct solution.

alternatively, i could approach this problem using the change of base formula for logarithms. the change of base formula states that:

log
⁡
b
a
=
log
⁡
c
a
log
⁡
c
b
log 
b
​
 a= 
log 
c
​
 b
log 
c
​
 a
​
 
for any positive real number 
c
c, not equal to 1. if i use the natural logarithm (base 
e
e), then:

log
⁡
x
32
=
ln
⁡
32
ln
⁡
x
=
5
2
log 
x
​
 32= 
lnx
ln32
​
 = 
2
5
​
 
so, setting up the equation:

ln
⁡
32
ln
⁡
x
=
5
2
lnx
ln32
​
 = 
2
5
​
 
cross-multiplying:

2
ln
⁡
32
=
5
ln
⁡
x
2ln32=5lnx
dividing both sides by 5:

2
5
ln
⁡
32
=
ln
⁡
x
5
2
​
 ln32=lnx
exponentiating both sides to eliminate the natural logarithm:

x
=
e
2
5
ln
⁡
32
x=e 
5
2
​
 ln32
 
using the property 
e
a
ln
⁡
b
=
b
a
e 
alnb
 =b 
a
 :

x
=
3
2
2
5
=
4
x=32 
5
2
​
 
 =4
again, i arrive at 
x
=
4
x=4, confirming my earlier result.

another way to think about this is to express both sides with the same base. since 32 is a power of 2, and i suspect that 
x
x might also be a power of 2, maybe i can let 
x
=
2
k
x=2 
k
  for some exponent 
k
k, and solve for 
k
k.

let’s set 
x
=
2
k
x=2 
k
 . then the original equation becomes:

log
⁡
2
k
32
=
5
2
log 
2 
k
 
​
 32= 
2
5
​
 
using the logarithm power rule, 
log
⁡
b
n
a
=
1
n
log
⁡
b
a
log 
b 
n
 
​
 a= 
n
1
​
 log 
b
​
 a, so:

1
k
log
⁡
2
32
=
5
2
k
1
​
 log 
2
​
 32= 
2
5
​
 
i know that 
log
⁡
2
32
=
5
log 
2
​
 32=5, because 
2
5
=
32
2 
5
 =32. plugging that in:

1
k
×
5
=
5
2
k
1
​
 ×5= 
2
5
​
 
simplifying:

5
k
=
5
2
k
5
​
 = 
2
5
​
 
dividing both sides by 5:

1
k
=
1
2
k
1
​
 = 
2
1
​
 
so, 
k
=
2
k=2. therefore, 
x
=
2
2
=
4
x=2 
2
 =4, which matches my previous results.

this consistency across different methods makes me confident that 
x
=
4
x=4 is the correct solution.

just to explore a bit more, suppose i didn't recognize that 32 is a power of 2. how else could i approach this problem?

let’s go back to the exponential form:

x
5
2
=
32
x 
2
5
​
 
 =32
i can rewrite this as:

(
x
1
2
)
5
=
32
(x 
2
1
​
 
 ) 
5
 =32
taking the fifth root of both sides:

x
1
2
=
32
5
x 
2
1
​
 
 = 
5
  
32
​
 
i know that 
32
=
2
5
32=2 
5
 , so:

32
5
=
2
5
  
32
​
 =2
therefore:

x
1
2
=
2
x 
2
1
​
 
 =2
squaring both sides to solve for 
x
x:

x
=
2
2
=
4
x=2 
2
 =4
again, i get 
x
=
4
x=4. it seems no matter which method i use, i end up with the same answer, which reinforces its correctness.

let me consider if there are any other possible solutions or if there’s something i might be missing. logarithms can sometimes have tricky properties, especially concerning their domains and ranges.

first, the logarithm 
log
⁡
x
32
log 
x
​
 32 is defined only if 
x
>
0
x>0 and 
x
≠
1
x

=1, because the base of a logarithm must be positive and not equal to 1. in this case, 
x
=
4
x=4 satisfies 
x
>
0
x>0 and 
x
≠
1
x

=1, so it’s a valid solution.

also, since 
32
32 is positive, there are no issues with taking logarithms here.

another thing to consider is whether there might be multiple solutions. however, since the equation 
x
5
2
=
32
x 
2
5
​
 
 =32 is a single-valued function for 
x
>
0
x>0, there should be only one real positive solution, which is 
x
=
4
x=4.

to be extra cautious, let's consider if there are any negative solutions. normally, logarithms with negative bases aren't defined in the real number system, and even if they were, raising a negative number to a fractional exponent can lead to complex numbers, which aren't considered in this context. therefore, 
x
=
4
x=4 is the only real solution.

just to summarize the methods i've used:

1. converting the logarithmic equation to its exponential form and solving for 
x
x.

2. using the change of base formula to express 
x
x in terms of natural logarithms and simplifying.

3. assuming 
x
x is a power of 2 and solving for the exponent.

4. manipulating the exponential equation by expressing it with roots and powers.

all these approaches consistently lead to 
x
=
4
x=4, so i’m confident in this answer.

one last thing: if i graph the functions 
y
=
log
⁡
x
32
y=log 
x
​
 32 and 
y
=
5
2
y= 
2
5
​
 , the intersection point should give me the value of 
x
x. while i can’t graph it here, based on the algebraic solutions, it should intersect at 
x
=
4
x=4.

in conclusion, after verifying through multiple methods and ensuring that all conditions for logarithms are satisfied, the solution to the equation 
log
⁡
x
32
=
5
2
log 
x
​
 32= 
2
5
​
  is indeed 
x
=
4
x=4.

**final answer**

4
