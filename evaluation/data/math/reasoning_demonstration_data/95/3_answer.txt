Answer: To find \( x \) in the equation \( \log_x 32 = \frac{5}{2} \), we start by converting the logarithmic form to its exponential form:

\[
x^{\frac{5}{2}} = 32
\]

next, we solve for \( x \) by raising both sides to the power of \( \frac{2}{5} \):

\[
\left( x^{\frac{5}{2}} \right)^{\frac{2}{5}} = 32^{\frac{2}{5}}
\]

simplifying the left side:

\[
x = 32^{\frac{2}{5}}
\]

since \( 32 = 2^5 \), we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
x = \left(2^5\right)^{\frac{2}{5}} = 2^{5 \times \frac{2}{5}} = 2^2 = 4
\]

to verify, we check by plugging \( x = 4 \) back into the original logarithmic equation:

\[
\log_4 32 = \frac{5}{2}
\]

this means:

\[
4^{\frac{5}{2}} = 32
\]

calculating \( 4^{\frac{5}{2}} \):

\[
4^{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad 2^5 = 32
\]

thus, \( 4^{\frac{5}{2}} = 32 \), confirming the solution. therefore, the value of \( x \) is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]
