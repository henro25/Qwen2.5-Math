Reasoning: 
Okay, let's see. I have this problem here: "Sixty percent of a plane's passengers are women and ten percent of those women are in first class. What is the number of women in first class if the plane is carrying 200 passengers?"

Alright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. So, there's a plane with 200 passengers total. Out of these, 60% are women. Then, out of those women, 10% are in first class. I need to find out how many women are in first class.

Hmm, maybe I should start by finding out how many women are on the plane. If 60% of the passengers are women, and there are 200 passengers, then I can calculate 60% of 200 to find the number of women.

So, 60% of 200 is... let's see, 10% of 200 is 20, so 60% would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, there are 120 women on the plane.

Now, out of these 120 women, 10% are in first class. So, I need to find 10% of 120. Again, 10% of 120 is 12. So, there are 12 women in first class.

Wait a minute, that seems straightforward. But maybe I should double-check my calculations to be sure.

Let me see, 60% of 200 passengers are women. 200 times 0.6 equals 120 women. Then, 10% of those women are in first class. 120 times 0.1 equals 12 women in first class.

Yeah, that seems correct. I think I've got it.
