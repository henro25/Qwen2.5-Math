Reasoning: I've got this problem here: let 
s
s be the sum of all integers 
b
b for which the polynomial 
x
2
+
b
x
+
2008
b
x 
2
 +bx+2008b can be factored over the integers. i need to compute 
∣
s
∣
∣s∣.

first, i need to understand what it means for a quadratic polynomial to be factored over the integers. a quadratic polynomial 
x
2
+
c
x
+
d
x 
2
 +cx+d can be factored over the integers if there exist integers 
m
m and 
n
n such that 
x
2
+
c
x
+
d
=
(
x
+
m
)
(
x
+
n
)
x 
2
 +cx+d=(x+m)(x+n). when i expand the right-hand side, i get 
x
2
+
(
m
+
n
)
x
+
m
n
x 
2
 +(m+n)x+mn. so, comparing coefficients, i have:

c
=
m
+
n
and
d
=
m
n
c=m+nandd=mn
in this problem, the polynomial is 
x
2
+
b
x
+
2008
b
x 
2
 +bx+2008b, so comparing to the general form, 
c
=
b
c=b and 
d
=
2008
b
d=2008b. therefore, for the polynomial to factor over the integers, there must exist integers 
m
m and 
n
n such that:

b
=
m
+
n
and
2008
b
=
m
n
b=m+nand2008b=mn
so, i need to find all integer pairs 
(
m
,
n
)
(m,n) that satisfy these two equations.

let me try to express 
n
n in terms of 
m
m. from the first equation, 
n
=
b
−
m
n=b−m. plugging this into the second equation:

2008
b
=
m
(
b
−
m
)
2008b=m(b−m)
expanding the right-hand side:

2008
b
=
b
m
−
m
2
2008b=bm−m 
2
 
let me rearrange this equation:

m
2
−
b
m
+
2008
b
=
0
m 
2
 −bm+2008b=0
this is a quadratic equation in terms of 
m
m. for 
m
m to be an integer, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square. the discriminant 
d
d is:

d
=
b
2
−
4
⋅
1
⋅
2008
b
=
b
2
−
8032
b
d=b 
2
 −4⋅1⋅2008b=b 
2
 −8032b
so, 
d
=
b
2
−
8032
b
d=b 
2
 −8032b must be a perfect square.

let me denote 
d
=
k
2
d=k 
2
 , where 
k
k is an integer. therefore:

b
2
−
8032
b
=
k
2
b 
2
 −8032b=k 
2
 
this looks tricky. maybe i can complete the square on the left-hand side.

completing the square for 
b
2
−
8032
b
b 
2
 −8032b:

b
2
−
8032
b
=
(
b
−
4016
)
2
−
401
6
2
b 
2
 −8032b=(b−4016) 
2
 −4016 
2
 
so,

(
b
−
4016
)
2
−
401
6
2
=
k
2
(b−4016) 
2
 −4016 
2
 =k 
2
 
rearranging:

(
b
−
4016
)
2
−
k
2
=
401
6
2
(b−4016) 
2
 −k 
2
 =4016 
2
 
this is a difference of squares on the left-hand side:

(
b
−
4016
−
k
)
(
b
−
4016
+
k
)
=
401
6
2
(b−4016−k)(b−4016+k)=4016 
2
 
let me set:

p
=
b
−
4016
−
k
and
q
=
b
−
4016
+
k
p=b−4016−kandq=b−4016+k
so, 
p
q
=
401
6
2
pq=4016 
2
 . also, adding these two equations:

p
+
q
=
2
(
b
−
4016
)
p+q=2(b−4016)
and subtracting them:

q
−
p
=
2
k
q−p=2k
but i'm not sure if this is leading me anywhere. maybe there's a better approach.

let me go back to the original equations:

b
=
m
+
n
and
2008
b
=
m
n
b=m+nand2008b=mn
from these, i can express 
n
n in terms of 
m
m and 
b
b, but i'm not sure if that's helpful.

alternatively, since 
2008
b
=
m
n
2008b=mn and 
b
=
m
+
n
b=m+n, perhaps i can substitute 
b
=
m
+
n
b=m+n into the second equation:

2008
(
m
+
n
)
=
m
n
2008(m+n)=mn
rearranging:

m
n
−
2008
m
−
2008
n
=
0
mn−2008m−2008n=0
let me add 
200
8
2
2008 
2
  to both sides:

m
n
−
2008
m
−
2008
n
+
200
8
2
=
200
8
2
mn−2008m−2008n+2008 
2
 =2008 
2
 
now, the left-hand side can be factored:

(
m
−
2008
)
(
n
−
2008
)
=
200
8
2
(m−2008)(n−2008)=2008 
2
 
this is a nice factorization! so, 
(
m
−
2008
)
(
n
−
2008
)
=
200
8
2
(m−2008)(n−2008)=2008 
2
 .

now, since 
m
m and 
n
n are integers, 
m
−
2008
m−2008 and 
n
−
2008
n−2008 are integers as well. so, i need to find all pairs of integers 
(
d
,
e
)
(d,e) such that 
d
e
=
200
8
2
de=2008 
2
 , and then set 
m
=
d
+
2008
m=d+2008 and 
n
=
e
+
2008
n=e+2008.

once i have 
m
m and 
n
n, i can find 
b
=
m
+
n
b=m+n. but since 
m
=
d
+
2008
m=d+2008 and 
n
=
e
+
2008
n=e+2008, then:

b
=
(
d
+
2008
)
+
(
e
+
2008
)
=
d
+
e
+
4016
b=(d+2008)+(e+2008)=d+e+4016
but since 
d
e
=
200
8
2
de=2008 
2
 , and 
e
=
200
8
2
d
e= 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 , assuming 
d
≠
0
d

=0, then:

b
=
d
+
200
8
2
d
+
4016
b=d+ 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 +4016
hmm, this seems a bit messy. maybe there's a better way to approach this.

let me consider that 
d
e
=
200
8
2
de=2008 
2
 , and both 
d
d and 
e
e are divisors of 
200
8
2
2008 
2
 . so, i need to find all pairs 
(
d
,
e
)
(d,e) where 
d
d and 
e
e are divisors of 
200
8
2
2008 
2
 , and 
d
e
=
200
8
2
de=2008 
2
 , and then compute 
b
=
d
+
e
+
4016
b=d+e+4016.

but finding all such pairs might be time-consuming. maybe i can find a smarter way.

alternatively, since 
d
e
=
200
8
2
de=2008 
2
 , i can write 
e
=
200
8
2
d
e= 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 , and then:

b
=
d
+
200
8
2
d
+
4016
b=d+ 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 +4016
to have 
b
b as an integer, 
200
8
2
d
d
2008 
2
 
​
  must be an integer, meaning 
d
d must be a divisor of 
200
8
2
2008 
2
 .

so, 
d
d is a divisor of 
200
8
2
2008 
2
 , and for each such 
d
d, 
b
=
d
+
200
8
2
d
+
4016
b=d+ 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 +4016.

now, to find all possible 
b
b, i need to find all divisors 
d
d of 
200
8
2
2008 
2
 , compute 
b
b for each 
d
d, and then sum them up.

but this seems computationally intensive. maybe there's a pattern or a formula to simplify this.

let me consider that the sum over all divisors 
d
d of 
200
8
2
2008 
2
  of 
b
=
d
+
200
8
2
d
+
4016
b=d+ 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 +4016 can be expressed in terms of the sum of divisors function.

first, note that 
2008
=
8
×
251
2008=8×251, since 
251
251 is a prime number.

so, 
2008
=
8
×
251
=
2
3
×
251
2008=8×251=2 
3
 ×251, and therefore:

200
8
2
=
(
2
3
×
251
)
2
=
2
6
×
25
1
2
2008 
2
 =(2 
3
 ×251) 
2
 =2 
6
 ×251 
2
 
the number of divisors of 
200
8
2
2008 
2
  is 
(
6
+
1
)
(
2
+
1
)
=
21
(6+1)(2+1)=21, but i'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

wait, perhaps i can pair the divisors 
d
d and 
200
8
2
d
d
2008 
2
 
​
 , since their product is 
200
8
2
2008 
2
 . for each pair 
(
d
,
e
)
(d,e), where 
e
=
200
8
2
d
e= 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 , i have 
b
=
d
+
e
+
4016
b=d+e+4016.

now, if i sum 
b
b over all such pairs, i get:

s
=
∑
b
=
∑
(
d
+
200
8
2
d
+
4016
)
s=∑b=∑(d+ 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 +4016)
but since 
d
d and 
e
=
200
8
2
d
e= 
d
2008 
2
 
​
  are paired, and 
d
d runs through all positive divisors of 
200
8
2
2008 
2
 , i need to ensure that i don't double-count.

actually, since 
d
d and 
e
e are distinct unless 
d
=
e
d=e, which happens when 
d
=
2008
d=2008, because 
200
8
2
/
2008
=
2008
2008 
2
 /2008=2008, but 
200
8
2
2008 
2
  is not a perfect square in the sense that 
2008
2008 squared is 
200
8
2
2008 
2
 , but in this case, 
d
=
200
8
2
/
d
d=2008 
2
 /d implies 
d
2
=
200
8
2
d 
2
 =2008 
2
 , so 
d
=
±
2008
d=±2008.

wait, actually, 
d
d can be negative as well, since divisors can be negative integers.

so, the divisors 
d
d of 
200
8
2
2008 
2
  include both positive and negative divisors.

therefore, for each positive divisor 
d
d, there is a corresponding negative divisor 
−
d
−d, and for each pair 
(
d
,
e
)
(d,e), 
e
=
200
8
2
d
e= 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 , and similarly for 
(
−
d
,
−
e
)
(−d,−e), since 
(
−
d
)
(
−
e
)
=
d
e
=
200
8
2
(−d)(−e)=de=2008 
2
 .

so, perhaps i can consider the positive divisors and then account for the negative ones.

alternatively, maybe there's a symmetry here that i can exploit to find the sum 
s
s without enumerating all possible divisors.

let me consider that for each pair 
(
d
,
e
)
(d,e), with 
d
e
=
200
8
2
de=2008 
2
 , i have:

b
=
d
+
e
+
4016
b=d+e+4016
if i sum over all such pairs, 
s
=
∑
b
=
∑
(
d
+
e
+
4016
)
s=∑b=∑(d+e+4016)

but since 
d
d and 
e
e are paired such that 
d
e
=
200
8
2
de=2008 
2
 , and for each 
d
d, there is exactly one 
e
e, then 
∑
d
+
∑
e
=
∑
(
d
+
e
)
=
∑
d
+
∑
200
8
2
d
∑d+∑e=∑(d+e)=∑d+∑ 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 

but 
∑
d
+
∑
200
8
2
d
=
∑
d
+
∑
200
8
2
d
=
∑
(
d

200

d
)
∑d+∑ 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 =∑d+∑ 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 =∑(d+ 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 )

this seems circular. maybe i need to think differently.

wait, perhaps i can consider that 
d
+
200
8
2
d
=
d
2
+
200
8
2
d
d+ 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 = 
d
d 
2
 +2008 
2
 
​
 , but that doesn't seem immediately helpful.

alternatively, maybe i can recall that the sum of all divisors of 
n
n is denoted by 
σ
(
n
)
σ(n), and similarly for other divisor functions.

so, 
∑
d
=
σ
(
200
8
2
)
∑d=σ(2008 
2
 ), and 
∑
200
8
2
d
=
∑
200
8

d
=
200

∑

​
 =∑

​
 

but 
∑

d
=
σ
(
200

)
200
8
2
∑ 
d
1
​
 = 
2008 
2
 
σ(2008

 )
​
 , since 
∑

d
=
σ

​
  
d

​
 

therefore, 
∑

d
=

⋅
σ
(
200

2
 ⋅ 
2008 
2
 
σ(2008

​
 =σ(2008

therefore, 
∑
(
d

200

d
)
=
σ
(
200

σ

​
 )=σ(2008

thus, 
s

⋅
τ
(
200

s=2σ(2008 
2
 )+4016⋅τ(2008 
2
 ), where 
τ
(
n
)
τ(n) is the number of divisors of 
n

wait, but this seems off because for each pair 
(
d
,
e
)
(d,e), with 
d
e
=
200
8
2
de=2008 
2
 , and 
b
=
d
+
e
+
4016
b=d+e+4016, the sum 
s
s should be 
∑
b
=
∑
(
d

e
+
4016
)
=
∑
d
+
∑
e
+
4016
⋅
number of pairs
∑b=∑(d+e+4016)=∑d+∑e+4016⋅number of pairs

but since each pair consists of 
d
d and 
e
=
200
8
2
d
e= 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 , and for each positive divisor 
d
d, there is a corresponding 
e
e, and also negative divisors, i need to account for both positive and negative divisors.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that for each positive divisor 
d
d, there is a corresponding negative divisor 
−
d
−d, and similarly for 
e
e. so, perhaps the sum over all possible 
b
b would involve both positive and negative contributions.

this is getting complicated. maybe there's a different approach.

let me consider that 
b
=
m
+
n
b=m+n, and 
m
n
=
2008
b
mn=2008b, with 
m
m and 
n
n integers.

from 
b
=
m
+
n
b=m+n, i can solve for 
n
=
b
−
m
n=b−m, and plug into the second equation:

m
(
b
−
m
)
=
2008
b
m(b−m)=2008b
which simplifies to:

m
b
−
m
2
=
2008
b
mb−m 
2
 =2008b
rearranging:

m
2
−
b
m
+
2008
b
=
0
m 
2
 −bm+2008b=0
this is a quadratic in 
m
m, and for integer solutions, the discriminant must be a perfect square.

the discriminant 
d
d is:

d
=
b
2
−
8032
b
d=b 
2
 −8032b
so, 
d
=
b
2
−
8032

d=b

 −8032b must be a perfect square.

let me set 
d
=
k
2
d=k 
2
 , where 
k
k is an integer:

b
2
−
8032
b
=
k
2
b 
2
 −8032b=k 
2
 
this can be rearranged as:

b
2
−
8032
b
−
k
2
=
0
b 
2
 −8032b−k 
2
 =0
this is a diophantine equation, and solving it for integers 
b
b and 
k
k might be challenging.

alternatively, perhaps i can complete the square for the expression 
b
2
−
8032
b
b 
2
 −8032b:

b
2
−
8032
b
=
(

)
2
−
401
6
2
b 
2
 −8032b=(b−4016) 
2
 −4016 
2
 
so,

(
b

)
2
−
k
2
=
401
6
2
(b−4016) 
2
 −k 
2
 =4016 
2
 
this can be factored as:

(
b
−
4016
−
k
)
(
b
−
4016
+
k
)
=
401
6
2
(b−4016−k)(b−4016+k)=4016 
2
 
let me denote:

p
=
b
−
4016
−
k
and
q
=
b
−
4016
+
k
p=b−4016−kandq=b−4016+k
then, 
p
q
=
401
6
2
pq=4016 
2
 , and adding the two equations:

p
+
q
=
2
(
b
−
4016
)
p+q=2(b−4016)
subtracting them:

q
−
p
=
2
k
q−p=2k
this gives me:

b
−
4016
=
p
+
q
2
and
k
=
q
−
p
2
b−4016= 
2
p+q
​
 andk= 
2
q−p
​
 
but i'm not sure if this is helping me find 
b
b.

maybe i can consider the factors of 
401
6
2
4016 
2
 . since 
4016
=
2
4
×
251
4016=2 
4
 ×251, then 
401
6
2
=
2
8
×
25
1
2
4016 
2
 =2 
8
 ×251 
2
 , so the number of positive divisors is 
(
8
+
1
)
(
2
+
1
)
=
27
(8+1)(2+1)=27, and including negative divisors, there are 
54
54 divisors in total.

for each divisor 
p
p of 
401
6
2
4016 
2
 , there is a corresponding 
q
=
401
6
2
p
q= 
p
4016 
2
 
​
 , and then 
b
−
4016
=
p
+
q
2
b−4016= 
2
p+q
​
 , so 
b
=
p
+
q
2
+
4016
b= 
2
p+q
​
 +4016.

therefore, each 
b
b is determined by a pair 
(
p
,
q
)
(p,q), where 
p
q
=
401
6
2
pq=4016 
2
 , and 
p
p and 
q
q are divisors of 
401
6
2
4016 
2
 .

now, to find the sum 
s
s of all such 
b
b, i need to sum 
b
=
p
+
q
2
+
4016
b= 
2
p+q
​
 +4016 over all such pairs 
(
p
,
q
)
(p,q).

but since 
p
p and 
q
q are paired such that 
p
q
=
401
6
2
pq=4016 
2
 , and each pair corresponds to a unique 
b
b, i need to find a way to sum 
b
b over all possible 
p
p.

alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to express 
s
s.

let me consider that for each divisor 
p
p of 
401
6
2
4016 
2
 , there is a corresponding 
q
=
401
6
2
p
q= 
p
4016 
2
 
​
 , and then 
b
=
p
+
q
2
+
4016
b= 
2
p+q
​
 +4016.

therefore, the sum 
s
s is:

s
=
∑
(
p

401

p

4016
)
s=∑( 
2

​
 
​
 +4016)
simplifying:

s
=
∑
(

)
+
∑
4016
s=∑( 
2
p+ 
p
4016 
2
 
​
 
​
 )+∑4016
the first sum is:

∑
(

=

∑
(
p

∑(

​
 
​
 )=

​
 ∑(p+

​
 )=

​
 (∑p+∑

 )
but 
∑
401

p
=

​
 =∑ 
p

2
 
​
 =4016 
2
 ∑ 
p

​
 

now, since 
p
p runs over all divisors of 
401
6
2
4016 
2
 , 
∑
1
p
=
σ
(
401

)
401

2
∑ 
p

​
 = 
4016 
2
 
σ(4016 
2
 )
​
 , where 
σ
(
n
)
σ(n) is the sum of divisors of 
n

therefore:

∑
401

p
=

σ
(

∑

​
 =4016 
2
 ⋅ 
4016 
2
 
σ(4016

​
 =σ(4016

 )
so, 
∑

∑
401

​
 =σ(4016

 )+σ(4016

 )

therefore, the first part of 
s
s is:

​
 ×2σ(4016 
2
 )=σ(4016

 )
and the second part is:

∑
4016
∑4016
but how many terms are there in the sum? each pair 
(
p
,
q
)
(p,q) corresponds to one 
b
b, and since 
p
p runs over all divisors of 
401
6
2
4016 
2
 , and for each 
p
p, there is one 
q
q, but since 
p
p and 
q
q are distinct unless 
p
=
q
p=q, i need to consider whether 
401
6
2
4016 
2
  is a perfect square, which it is, since 
401
6
2
=
(
4016
)
2
4016 
2
 =(4016) 
2
 , so 
p
=
q
=
4016
p=q=4016 is one possibility.

actually, 
401
6
2
4016 
2
  is a perfect square, so there is one divisor where 
p
=
q
=
4016
p=q=4016, and the other divisors come in pairs where 
p
≠
q
p

=q.

therefore, the number of unique pairs 
(
p
,
q
)
(p,q) is equal to the number of positive divisors of 
401
6
2
4016 
2
 , which is 27, plus their negative counterparts, giving a total of 54 divisors.

wait, but in the context of pairing 
p
p and 
q
q, perhaps i need to consider both positive and negative divisors.

this is getting too complicated. maybe there's a better way.

let me consider that 
b
=
d
+
e
+
4016
b=d+e+4016, where 
d
e
=
200
8
2
de=2008 
2
 . so, 
b
=
d
+
200
8
2
d
+
4016
b=d+ 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 +4016.

if i let 
d
d run over all divisors of 
200
8
2
2008 
2
 , including negative ones, then 
b
b will take on a certain set of values, and i need to sum all those 
b
b values.

but instead of summing over 
d
d, perhaps i can consider that for each divisor 
d
d, there is a corresponding divisor 
e
=
200
8
2
d
e= 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 , and thus each pair 
(
d
,
e
)
(d,e) gives a unique 
b
b.

however, summing over all such 
b
b seems tedious. maybe there's a symmetry or a formula that can simplify this sum.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that 
b
=
d
+
e
+
4016
b=d+e+4016, and since 
d
e
=
200
8
2
de=2008 
2
 , maybe i can express 
b
b in terms of 
d
d only and find a pattern.

wait a minute, let's consider that 
b
=
d
+
200
8
2
d
+
4016
b=d+ 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 +4016. if i set 
d
=
2008
d=2008, then 
e
=
200
8
2
2008
=
2008
e= 
2008
2008 
2
 
​
 =2008, so 
b
=
2008
+
2008
+
4016
=
8032
b=2008+2008+4016=8032. that's one possible value of 
b
b.

but there are many other divisors of 
200
8
2
2008 
2
 , so there are many other possible 
b
b values.

this approach seems too involved for a competition problem; there must be a smarter way.

let me try another angle. suppose the polynomial 
x
2
+
b
x
+
2008
b
x 
2
 +bx+2008b factors as 
(
x
+
m
)
(
x
+
n
)
(x+m)(x+n), with integer 
m
m and 
n
n. then, as established earlier, 
b
=
m
+
n
b=m+n and 
2008
b
=
m
n
2008b=mn.

substituting 
b
=
m
+
n
b=m+n into the second equation:

2008
(
m
+
n
)
=
m
n
2008(m+n)=mn
rearranging:

m
n
−
2008
m
−
2008
n
=
0
mn−2008m−2008n=0
adding 
200
8
2
2008 
2
  to both sides:

m
n
−
2008
m
−
2008
n
+
200
8
2
=
200
8
2
mn−2008m−2008n+2008 
2
 =2008 
2
 
factoring the left-hand side:

(
m
−
2008
)
(
n
−
2008
)
=
200
8
2
(m−2008)(n−2008)=2008 
2
 
this is a neat factorization. now, 
m
−
2008
m−2008 and 
n
−
2008
n−2008 are integers whose product is 
200
8
2
2008 
2
 . therefore, 
m
−
2008
m−2008 and 
n
−
2008
n−2008 are pairs of divisors of 
200
8
2
2008 
2
 .

let me denote 
d
=
m
−
2008
d=m−2008 and 
e
=
n
−
2008
e=n−2008, so 
d
e
=
200
8
2
de=2008 
2
 .

then, 
m
=
d
+
2008
m=d+2008 and 
n
=
e
+
2008
n=e+2008, and 
b
=
m
+
n
=
d
+
e
+
4016
b=m+n=d+e+4016.

therefore, each pair 
(
d
,
e
)
(d,e) with 
d
e
=
200
8
2
de=2008 
2
  corresponds to a value of 
b
=
d
+
e
+
4016
b=d+e+4016.

now, to find the sum 
s
s of all such 
b
b, i need to sum 
b
=
d
+
e
+
4016
b=d+e+4016 over all pairs 
(
d
,
e
)
(d,e) with 
d
e
=
200
8
2
de=2008 
2
 .

but since 
e
=
200
8
2
d
e= 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 , i can write 
b
=
d
+
200
8
2
d
+
4016
b=d+ 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 +4016.

therefore, 
s
=
∑
(
d
+
200
8
2
d
+
4016
)
s=∑(d+ 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 +4016), where the sum is over all divisors 
d
d of 
200
8
2
2008 
2
 , including negative ones.

this seems similar to what i had before. maybe there's a way to simplify this sum.

let me consider that for each positive divisor 
d
d of 
200
8
2
2008 
2
 , there is a corresponding negative divisor 
−
d
−d, and similarly for 
e
e.

therefore, the sum 
s
s can be written as:

s
=
∑
d
∣
200
8
2
(
d
+
200
8
2
d
+
4016
)
s= 
d∣2008 
2
 
∑
​
 (d+ 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 +4016)
but since divisors come in positive and negative pairs, i can consider both cases.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that for each positive divisor 
d
d, there is a corresponding positive divisor 
e
=
200
8
2
d
e= 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 , and similarly for negative divisors.

therefore, the sum over all 
b
b can be expressed as:

s
=
∑
d
∣
200
8
2
(
d
+
200
8
2
d
+
4016
)
s= 
d∣2008 
2
 
∑
​
 (d+ 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 +4016)
but this seems too broad. maybe i need to find a way to pair the terms or find a symmetry.

wait a minute, perhaps i can group the terms in a way that the sum simplifies.

let me consider that for each pair 
(
d
,
e
)
(d,e), where 
d
e
=
200
8
2
de=2008 
2
 , the corresponding 
b
b values are 
b
=
d
+
e
+
4016
b=d+e+4016.

if i sum over all such pairs, i get 
s
=
∑
(
d
+
e
+
4016
)
s=∑(d+e+4016).

but since 
d
d and 
e
e are related by 
d
e
=
200
8
2
de=2008 
2
 , perhaps there's a relationship between the sum of 
d
d and 
e
e over all such pairs.

alternatively, maybe i can consider that the sum of 
d
+
e
d+e over all such pairs is equal to the sum of all divisors of 
200
8
2
2008 
2
  plus the sum of their reciprocals times 
200
8
2
2008 
2
 , but that doesn't seem immediately helpful.

perhaps i need to think differently. let me consider that 
b
=
d
+
e
+
4016
b=d+e+4016, and 
d
e
=
200
8
2
de=2008 
2
 .

if i fix 
d
d, then 
e
=
200
8
2
d
e= 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 , and so 
b
=
d
+
200
8
2
d
+
4016
b=d+ 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 +4016.

therefore, for each divisor 
d
d of 
200
8
2
2008 
2
 , 
b
b is determined as above.

now, to find the sum 
s
s, i need to sum this expression over all divisors 
d
d of 
200
8
2
2008 
2
 , including negative ones.

but summing over all divisors directly seems tedious, especially since 
200
8
2
2008 
2
  has many divisors.

maybe there's a formula or property of divisors that can simplify this sum.

let me recall that the sum of divisors function 
σ
(
n
)
σ(n) is multiplicative, and for 
n
=
p
k
n=p 
k
 , 
σ
(
n
)
=
1
+
p
+
p
2
+
⋯
+
p
k
σ(n)=1+p+p 
2
 +⋯+p 
k
 .

given that 
2008
=
2
3
×
251
2008=2 
3
 ×251, then 
200
8

=

×
25
1
2
2008 
2
 =2 
6
 ×251 
2
 .

therefore, the sum of positive divisors of 
200
8
2
2008 
2
  is:

σ
(

σ(2008

calculating each part:

σ(251

therefore:

σ

=

×
63253
σ(2008

i can calculate this product:

first, calculate 
127
×
60000
=
7
,
620
,
000
127×60000=7,620,000

then,

×
3
,
253
=
127
×
3
,
000
=
381
,
000
127×3,253=127×3,000=381,000 plus 
127

253
=
127×253=

first, 
127

200
=

400
127×200=25,400

then, 
127

50
=

,
350
127×50=6,350

then, 
127

3
=

127×3=381

adding up: 
25
,
400
+
6
,
350
=

,
750
25,400+6,350=31,750, plus 
381
=

,

381=32,131

so,

,
253
=

,
131
=
413
,
131
127×3,253=381,000+32,131=413,131

therefore, 
σ

200

)
=

,
620

000
+
413
,
131
=

,

,
131
σ(2008

 )=7,620,000+413,131=8,033,131

now, going back to the sum 
s
s:

s
=
∑
(
d

)
=
∑
d
+
∑
e
+
4016
×
number of pairs
s=∑(d+e+4016)=∑d+∑e+4016×number of pairs
but 
e
=
200
8
2
d
e= 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 , so 
∑
e
=
∑
200
8
2
d
∑e=∑ 
d
2008

​
 

i already have 
∑
d
=
σ
(
200

)
∑d=σ(2008 
2
 ), and 
∑
200

d
=
σ

200
8

)
∑ 
d
2008

​
 =σ(2008

 ), as established earlier.

therefore:

s
=
σ

200

+
σ
(
200

)
+
4016
×
number of pairs
s=σ(2008 
2
 )+σ(2008 
2
 )+4016×number of pairs
but what's the number of pairs?

each pair 
(
d
,
e
)
(d,e) corresponds to a unique factorization, and since 
d
d and 
e
e are divisors of 
200
8
2
2008 
2
 , with 
d
e
=
200
8
2
de=2008 
2
 , and considering both positive and negative divisors, the number of such pairs is equal to the number of positive divisors of 
200
8
2
2008 
2
 , which is 27, plus their negative counterparts, totaling 54.

therefore:

s
=
2
σ
(
200
8
2
)
+
4016
×
54
s=2σ(2008 
2
 )+4016×54
wait, but this doesn't seem right because 
σ
(
200
8
2
)
σ(2008 
2
 ) already includes both positive and negative divisors, or does it?

actually, 
σ
(
n
)
σ(n) is typically defined for positive divisors only. so, to account for negative divisors, i need to consider that for each positive divisor 
d
d, there is a corresponding negative divisor 
−
d
−d, and similarly for 
e
e.

therefore, the sum over all divisors, including negatives, would be 
2
σ
(
200
8
2
)
2σ(2008 
2
 ), since each positive divisor has a negative counterpart.

therefore, 
s
=
2
σ
(
200
8
2
)
+
4016
×
54
s=2σ(2008 
2
 )+4016×54

but wait, no. let's think carefully.

each pair 
(
d
,
e
)
(d,e) corresponds to a unique 
b
b, and there are 54 such pairs (27 positive and 27 negative).

therefore, 
s
=
2
σ
(
200
8
2
)
+
4016
×
54
s=2σ(2008 
2
 )+4016×54

now, substituting 
σ
(
200
8
2
)
=
8
,
033
,
131
σ(2008 
2
 )=8,033,131:

s
=
2
×
8
,
033
,
131
+
4016
×
54
s=2×8,033,131+4016×54
calculating each part:

first, 
2
×
8
,
033
,
131
=
16
,
066
,
262
2×8,033,131=16,066,262

then, 
4016
×
54
4016×54:

calculate 
4000
×
54
=
216
,
000
4000×54=216,000

then, 
16
×
54
=
864
16×54=864

adding up: 
216
,
000
+
864
=
216
,
864
216,000+864=216,864

therefore:

s
=
16
,
066
,
262
+
216
,
864
=
16
,
283
,
126
s=16,066,262+216,864=16,283,126
now, the problem asks for the absolute value of 
s
s, which is 
∣
s
∣
=
16
,
283
,
126
∣s∣=16,283,126

but i need to check if this is correct.

wait a minute, i might have made a mistake in calculating the number of pairs. since each positive divisor pairs with its reciprocal, and similarly for negative divisors, but in the context of the sum, perhaps there's a different consideration.

alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to compute 
s
s without summing over all divisors.

let me consider that 
b
=
d
+
e
+
4016
=
d
+
200
8
2
d
+
4016
b=d+e+4016=d+ 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 +4016, and that the sum 
s
=
∑
b
=
∑
(
d
+
200
8
2
d
+
4016
)
s=∑b=∑(d+ 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 +4016), over all divisors 
d
d of 
200
8
2
2008 
2
 , including negative ones.

therefore:

s
=
∑
d
+
∑
200
8
2
d
+
4016
×
τ
(
200
8
2
)
s=∑d+∑ 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 +4016×τ(2008 
2
 )
where 
τ
(
n
)
τ(n) is the number of divisors of 
n
n, which is 54 for 
200
8
2
2008 
2
 , since 
200
8
2
=
2
6
×
25
1
2
2008 
2
 =2 
6
 ×251 
2
 , and 
(
6
+
1
)
(
2
+
1
)
=
21
(6+1)(2+1)=21 positive divisors, so 42 negative divisors, totaling 54.

now, 
∑
d
=
∑
d
∣
200
8

d
=
σ
(
200

033
,
131
∑d=∑ 
d∣2008 
2
 
​
 d=σ(2008 
2
 )=8,033,131, but since we are including negative divisors, the sum of all divisors, positive and negative, is zero, because for every positive divisor 
d
d, there is a corresponding negative divisor 
−
d
−d, and their sum is zero.

wait, that can't be right, because 
d
d and 
−
d
−d would cancel each other out, so 
∑
d
=
0
∑d=0, and similarly 
∑
200
8
2
d
=
0
∑ 
d
2008 
2
 
​
 =0, since 
200
8

−
d
=

200
8
2
d
−d
2008

​
 =− 
d

​
 , which also cancels out.

therefore, 
s
=
0
+
0
+
4016
×
54
s=0+0+4016×54

so, 
s
=
4016
×
54
s=4016×54

calculating this:

4000
×
54
=
216
,
000
4000×54=216,000

16
×
54
=
864
16×54=864

adding up: 
216
,
000
+
864
=
216
,
864
216,000+864=216,864

therefore, 
∣
s
∣
=
216
,
864
∣s∣=216,864

but wait, earlier i thought that 
∑
d
=
σ
(
200
8
2
)
∑d=σ(2008 
2
 ), but actually, when including negative divisors, the sum cancels out to zero.

therefore, 
s
=
0
+
0
+
4016
×
54
=
216
,
864
s=0+0+4016×54=216,864

this seems more plausible.

thus, the answer is 
∣
s
∣
=
216
,
864
∣s∣=216,864

**final answer**
