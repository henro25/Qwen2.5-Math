Reasoning: So i need to find 
f
−
1
(
7
)
+
f
−
1
(
46
)
f 
−1
 (7)+f 
−1
 (46) for the function 
f
(
x
)
f(x) defined piecewise. the function is:

f
(
x
)
=
{
x
+
3
if 
x
<
20
,
2
x
−
2
if 
x
≥
20.
 
f(x)={ 
x+3
2x−2
​	
  
if x<20,
if x≥20.
​	
 
first, i should recall what an inverse function is. the inverse function 
f
−
1
(
y
)
f 
−1
 (y) gives me the value of 
x
x such that 
f
(
x
)
=
y
f(x)=y. so, for each 
y
y, i need to find the corresponding 
x
x that makes 
f
(
x
)
=
y
f(x)=y.

but since 
f
(
x
)
f(x) is defined piecewise, i need to consider which piece to use based on the value of 
y
y.

let me start by finding 
f
−
1
(
7
)
f 
−1
 (7).

i need to solve 
f
(
x
)
=
7
f(x)=7.

first, i need to determine which piece of the function to use. since 
f
(
x
)
=
x
+
3
f(x)=x+3 when 
x
<
20
x<20 and 
f
(
x
)
=
2
x
−
2
f(x)=2x−2 when 
x
≥
20
x≥20, i should check which one could give me 
y
=
7
y=7.

let's consider both cases.

case 1: 
x
<
20
x<20, so 
f
(
x
)
=
x
+
3
f(x)=x+3.

set 
x
+
3
=
7
x+3=7.

then 
x
=
7
−
3
=
4
x=7−3=4.

now, check if this 
x
x satisfies 
x
<
20
x<20. yes, 4 < 20, so this is valid.

so, 
f
−
1
(
7
)
=
4
f 
−1
 (7)=4.

now, find 
f
−
1
(
46
)
f 
−1
 (46).

again, set 
f
(
x
)
=
46
f(x)=46.

consider both cases.

case 1: 
x
<
20
x<20, 
f
(
x
)
=
x
+
3
f(x)=x+3.

set 
x
+
3
=
46
x+3=46.

then 
x
=
46
−
3
=
43
x=46−3=43.

but wait, 43 is not less than 20. so this doesn't satisfy 
x
<
20
x<20. therefore, this case is invalid.

case 2: 
x
≥
20
x≥20, 
f
(
x
)
=
2
x
−
2
f(x)=2x−2.

set 
2
x
−
2
=
46
2x−2=46.

then 
2
x
=
46
+
2
=
48
2x=46+2=48.

so, 
x
=
48
/
2
=
24
x=48/2=24.

check if 
x
≥
20
x≥20. yes, 24 >= 20, so this is valid.

therefore, 
f
−
1
(
46
)
=
24
f 
−1
 (46)=24.

now, add them up: 
f
−
1
(
7
)
+
f
−
1
(
46
)
=
4
+
24
=
28
f 
−1
 (7)+f 
−1
 (46)=4+24=28.

wait a minute, is that all? it seems straightforward, but i should double-check if there are any other possibilities or if i missed something.

let me verify the inverse function definitions.

for 
f
(
x
)
f(x), since it's piecewise-defined, the inverse will also be piecewise, but i handled it by considering each case separately, which seems correct.

also, for 
f
−
1
(
7
)
f 
−1
 (7), i found 
x
=
4
x=4, and for 
f
−
1
(
46
)
f 
−1
 (46), 
x
=
24
x=24, which are in their respective domains. so, no issues there.

alternatively, i could think about the ranges of each piece of 
f
(
x
)
f(x) to see if there are overlapping or any concerns.

for 
x
<
20
x<20, 
f
(
x
)
=
x
+
3
f(x)=x+3, so the range is 
(
−
∞
,
23
)
(−∞,23), since as 
x
x approaches 20 from below, 
f
(
x
)
f(x) approaches 23.

for 
x
≥
20
x≥20, 
f
(
x
)
=
2
x
−
2
f(x)=2x−2, so the range is 
[
38
,
∞
)
[38,∞), because when 
x
=
20
x=20, 
f
(
x
)
=
2
∗
20
−
2
=
38
f(x)=2∗20−2=38, and it increases from there.

wait a second, according to this, 
f
(
x
)
f(x) for 
x
<
20
x<20 gives 
f
(
x
)
<
23
f(x)<23, and for 
x
≥
20
x≥20, 
f
(
x
)
≥
38
f(x)≥38.

but in my earlier calculation, for 
y
=
46
y=46, i used the second piece and got 
x
=
24
x=24, which is fine since 46 >= 38.

however, for 
y
=
7
y=7, 7 < 23, so it should be in the first piece, which i correctly used.

but what about values between 23 and 38? it seems there are no outputs from 
f
(
x
)
f(x) in that interval. does that matter for this problem? probably not, since we're only asked for 
y
=
7
y=7 and 
y
=
46
y=46, which are within the defined ranges.

so, i think my answer is correct.

**final answer**
