Reasoning: So i have this problem here: express 
1.
27
‾
1. 
27
  as a common fraction in lowest terms. hmm, okay, i need to turn this repeating decimal into a fraction. i remember there's a method for converting repeating decimals to fractions, but i'm a bit rusty on the details. let's see if i can work through it step by step.

first, i know that the notation 
1.
27
‾
1. 
27
  means that the digits "27" are repeating indefinitely. so, it's 
1.272727...
1.272727... and so on. i need to find a fraction that equals this decimal.

i recall that there's a standard approach for converting repeating decimals to fractions, which involves setting the decimal equal to a variable and then manipulating the equation to solve for that variable. let me try that.

let me set 
x
=
1.
27
‾
x=1. 
27
 .

so, 
x
=
1.272727...
x=1.272727...

now, since the repeating part is two digits long ("27"), i should multiply both sides of the equation by 100 to move the decimal point two places to the right. that should help me eliminate the repeating part.

multiplying both sides by 100:

100
x
=
127.272727...
100x=127.272727...

now, i have:

x
=
1.272727...
x=1.272727...

100
x
=
127.272727...
100x=127.272727...

if i subtract the first equation from the second, the repeating decimals should cancel out.

so, 
100
x
−
x
=
127.272727...
−
1.272727...
100x−x=127.272727...−1.272727...

that simplifies to:

99
x
=
126
99x=126

now, to solve for 
x
x, i divide both sides by 99:

x
=
126
99
x= 
99
126
​	
 

okay, so 
1.
27
‾
=
126
99
1. 
27
 = 
99
126
​	
 . but the problem asks for the fraction in lowest terms, so i need to simplify this fraction.

to simplify 
126
99
99
126
​	
 , i need to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 126 and 99 and then divide both the numerator and the denominator by that gcd.

let's find the gcd of 126 and 99.

first, list the factors of each number.

factors of 126: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 14, 18, 21, 42, 63, 126

factors of 99: 1, 3, 9, 11, 33, 99

the common factors are 1, 3, and 9. so, the greatest common divisor is 9.

now, divide both numerator and denominator by 9:

126
÷
9
99
÷
9
=
14
11
99÷9
126÷9
​	
 = 
11
14
​	
 

wait a minute, 
14
11
11
14
​	
  seems like a simplified fraction, but i should check if it's in lowest terms.

let's see, 14 and 11 have no common factors other than 1, since 11 is a prime number and doesn't divide 14. so, 
14
11
11
14
​	
  is indeed in lowest terms.

but wait, i'm supposed to express 
1.
27
‾
1. 
27
  as a fraction. is 
14
11
11
14
​	
  equal to 
1.
27
‾
1. 
27
 ? let me verify by dividing 14 by 11.

14 divided by 11 is 1.272727..., which matches 
1.
27
‾
1. 
27
 . so, it looks correct.

alternatively, i can cross-check by converting 
14
11
11
14
​	
  back to a decimal to ensure it matches 
1.
27
‾
1. 
27
 .

let's do that: 14 divided by 11.

11 goes into 14 once (1), with a remainder of 3. then, add a decimal point and a zero, making it 30.

11 goes into 30 twice (2), with a remainder of 8.

add another zero, making it 80.

11 goes into 80 seven times (7), with a remainder of 3.

add another zero, making it 30 again.

so, the decimal is 1.272727..., which is 
1.
27
‾
1. 
27
 . perfect, it checks out.

therefore, the fraction representation of 
1.
27
‾
1. 
27
  in lowest terms is 
14
11
11
14
​	
 .

but just to make sure i didn't make any mistakes, let me try another method to confirm.

another way to convert repeating decimals to fractions is to separate the non-repeating part from the repeating part. in this case, the decimal is 
1.
27
‾
1. 
27
 , where "1" is the non-repeating part, and "27" is the repeating part.

the formula for converting such decimals is:

fraction
=
entire number without the decimal point
−
non-repeating part
a number consisting of as many 9’s as the length of the repeating part followed by as many 0’s as the length of the non-repeating part after the decimal
fraction= 
a number consisting of as many 9’s as the length of the repeating part followed by as many 0’s as the length of the non-repeating part after the decimal
entire number without the decimal point−non-repeating part
​	
 
wait, i'm getting a bit confused with the formula. maybe i should look it up or recall it properly.

actually, a more straightforward formula for a repeating decimal where the repeating part starts right after the decimal point is:

fraction
=
repeating part
a number consisting of as many 9’s as the length of the repeating part
fraction= 
a number consisting of as many 9’s as the length of the repeating part
repeating part
​	
 
but in this case, there's a non-repeating part before the decimal.

hmm, maybe i need to adjust the formula for this scenario.

let me try to express 
1.
27
‾
1. 
27
  as 
1
+
0.
27
‾
1+0. 
27
 , and then find the fraction for 
0.
27
‾
0. 
27
  separately.

so, 
1.
27
‾
=
1
+
0.
27
‾
1. 
27
 =1+0. 
27
 

i already know that 
0.
27
‾
=
27
99
0. 
27
 = 
99
27
​	
 , because the repeating part is two digits, so it's 27 over 99.

then, 
1.
27
‾
=
1
+
27
99
1. 
27
 =1+ 
99
27
​	
 

simplify 
27
99
99
27
​	
 : divide numerator and denominator by 9, which gives 
3
11
11
3
​	
 

so, 
1.
27
‾
=
1
+
3
11
=
11
11
+
3
11
=
14
11
1. 
27
 =1+ 
11
3
​	
 = 
11
11
​	
 + 
11
3
​	
 = 
11
14
​	
 

again, i arrive at 
14
11
11
14
​	
 , which matches my previous result. this reinforces that the answer is correct.

just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any alternative approach or if i might have overlooked something.

another method involves using infinite series. since 
1.
27
‾
=
1
+
0.27
+
0.0027
+
0.000027
+
…
1. 
27
 =1+0.27+0.0027+0.000027+…, this is a geometric series with first term 
a
=
0.27
a=0.27 and common ratio 
r
=
0.01
r=0.01.

the sum of an infinite geometric series is 
s
=
a
1
−
r
s= 
1−r
a
​	
 , provided that 
∣
r
∣
<
1
∣r∣<1.

so, 
0.
27
‾
=
0.27
1
−
0.01
=
0.27
0.99
=
27
99
=
3
11
0. 
27
 = 
1−0.01
0.27
​	
 = 
0.99
0.27
​	
 = 
99
27
​	
 = 
11
3
​	
 , as before.

therefore, 
1.
27
‾
=
1
+
3
11
=
14
11
1. 
27
 =1+ 
11
3
​	
 = 
11
14
​	
 , confirming my earlier conclusion.

i think i've approached this problem from multiple angles and consistently arrived at the same answer, so i'm confident that 
14
11
11
14
​	
  is the correct and simplest form of the fraction representing 
1.
27
‾
1. 
27
 .

**final answer**

14
