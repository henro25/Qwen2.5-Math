Answer: To express \(1.\overline{27}\) as a common fraction in lowest terms, we start by setting \(x = 1.\overline{27}\). this means \(x = 1.272727...\).

next, we multiply both sides by 100 to shift the decimal point two places to the right:

\[
100x = 127.272727...
\]

we then subtract the original equation from this new equation:

\[
100x - x = 127.272727... - 1.272727...
\]

this simplifies to:

\[
99x = 126
\]

solving for \(x\), we get:

\[
x = \frac{126}{99}
\]

to simplify \(\frac{126}{99}\), we find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 126 and 99, which is 9. dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 9:

\[
\frac{126 \div 9}{99 \div 9} = \frac{14}{11}
\]

thus, the fraction representation of \(1.\overline{27}\) in lowest terms is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{14}{11}}
\]
