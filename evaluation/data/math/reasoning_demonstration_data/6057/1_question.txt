Problem: Circles of radius $3$ and $6$ are externally tangent to each other and are internally tangent to a circle of radius $9$. The circle of radius $9$ has a chord that is a common external tangent of the other two circles. Find the square of the length of this chord.
[asy] pointpen = black; pathpen = black + linewidth(0.7); size(150); pair A=(0,0), B=(6,0), C=(-3,0), D=C+6*expi(acos(1/3)), F=B+3*expi(acos(1/3)), P=IP(F--F+3*(D-F),CR(A,9)), Q=IP(F--F+3*(F-D),CR(A,9)); D(CR(A,9)); D(CR(B,3)); D(CR(C,6)); D(P--Q); [/asy]
