Answer: To find the value of \( a \) in the equation \( y = a \sin(bx + c) + d \), we need to determine the amplitude of the sine function. the amplitude \( a \) is half the distance between the maximum and minimum values of the function.

from the graph, we observe that the maximum value of the function is \( y = 3 \) and the minimum value is \( y = -1 \). using these values, we can set up the following equations:

\[
a + d = 3
\]
\[
-a + d = -1
\]

we solve this system of equations by adding and subtracting them:

1. add the two equations:
\[
(a + d) + (-a + d) = 3 + (-1) \implies 2d = 2 \implies d = 1
\]

2. substitute \( d = 1 \) back into the first equation:
\[
a + 1 = 3 \implies a = 2
\]

thus, the value of \( a \) is \(\boxed{2}\).
