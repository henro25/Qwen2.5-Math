Reasoning: Let's tackle this problem step by step. so, i've got this expression:

3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
)
)
)
)
)
)
)
)
)
3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))
whoa, that's a lot of nested parentheses! it looks a bit intimidating at first, but i think if i break it down, it'll make more sense.

first, i need to understand the structure of this expression. it seems like there's a pattern here: each time, there's a 3 multiplied by another expression that starts with 1 plus another similar structure. so, it's like a repeating pattern going inward.

maybe i can start by simplifying the innermost part and work my way outward. let's see how many layers there are. counting the parentheses, it looks like there are nine layers of nesting. that's a lot, but if i take it one step at a time, it should be manageable.

let me start with the innermost expression:

1
+
3
1+3
that's straightforward. 
1
+
3
=
4
1+3=4.

now, moving one layer outward:

1
+
3
(
4
)
1+3(4)
wait, no, actually, it's 
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
)
1+3(1+3), which we've just calculated as 
1
+
3
(
4
)
1+3(4). so, 
1
+
12
=
13
1+12=13.

wait, no, hold on. let me make sure i'm doing this correctly. the innermost part is 
1
+
3
1+3, which is 4, then the next layer is 
1
+
3
(
4
)
1+3(4), which is 
1
+
12
=
13
1+12=13, and then the next layer is 
1
+
3
(
13
)
1+3(13), which is 
1
+
39
=
40
1+39=40, and so on.

this could take a while if i do it step by step for each layer. maybe there's a pattern or a formula i can use to simplify this instead of expanding each layer individually.

let me think about the general form of this expression. it looks like a recursive expression where each layer is defined in terms of the previous one.

let's denote the entire expression as 
e
e. so,

e
=
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
)
)
)
)
)
)
)
)
)
e=3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))
but that's the same as the original expression. maybe i can define a function or a sequence to represent this nesting.

alternatively, perhaps i can look for a pattern by calculating a few initial terms.

let's define 
a
1
=
1
+
3
a 
1
​	
 =1+3, which is 4.

then, 
a
2
=
1
+
3
(
a
1
)
=
1
+
3
(
4
)
=
1
+
12
=
13
a 
2
​	
 =1+3(a 
1
​	
 )=1+3(4)=1+12=13

a
3
=
1
+
3
(
a
2
)
=
1
+
3
(
13
)
=
1
+
39
=
40
a 
3
​	
 =1+3(a 
2
​	
 )=1+3(13)=1+39=40

a
4
=
1
+
3
(
a
3
)
=
1
+
3
(
40
)
=
1
+
120
=
121
a 
4
​	
 =1+3(a 
3
​	
 )=1+3(40)=1+120=121

hmm, i see a pattern here. each term is 1 plus three times the previous term.

so, 
a
n
=
1
+
3
a
n
−
1
a 
n
​	
 =1+3a 
n−1
​	
 , with 
a
1
=
4
a 
1
​	
 =4.

this is a recursive sequence. maybe i can find a closed-form formula for 
a
n
a 
n
​	
 .

to find a closed-form, i can solve this recurrence relation.

first, let's write down the recurrence:

a
n
=
1
+
3
a
n
−
1
a 
n
​	
 =1+3a 
n−1
​	
 
this is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. to solve it, i can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.

the homogeneous equation is:

a
n
(
h
)
=
3
a
n
−
1
(
h
)
a 
n
(h)
​	
 =3a 
n−1
(h)
​	
 
the characteristic equation is 
r
=
3
r=3, so the homogeneous solution is:

a
n
(
h
)
=
a
⋅
3
n
a 
n
(h)
​	
 =a⋅3 
n
 
now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), i can assume a particular solution of the form 
a
n
(
p
)
=
c
a 
n
(p)
​	
 =c, where c is a constant.

plugging into the recurrence:

c
=
1
+
3
c
c=1+3c
solving for c:

c
−
3
c
=
1
c−3c=1
−
2
c
=
1
−2c=1
c
=
−
1
2
c=− 
2
1
​	
 
so, the general solution is:

a
n
=
a
n
(
h
)
+
a
n
(
p
)
=
a
⋅
3
n
−
1
2
a 
n
​	
 =a 
n
(h)
​	
 +a 
n
(p)
​	
 =a⋅3 
n
 − 
2
1
​	
 
now, i need to find the constant a using the initial condition. given that 
a
1
=
4
a 
1
​	
 =4:

4
=
a
⋅
3
1
−
1
2
4=a⋅3 
1
 − 
2
1
​	
 
4
=
3
a
−
1
2
4=3a− 
2
1
​	
 
3
a
=
4
+
1
2
3a=4+ 
2
1
​	
 
3
a
=
9
2
3a= 
2
9
​	
 
a
=
9
2
⋅
1
3
=
3
2
a= 
2
9
​	
 ⋅ 
3
1
​	
 = 
2
3
​	
 
therefore, the closed-form formula is:

a
n
=
3
2
⋅
3
n
−
1
2
=
3
n
+
1
2
−
1
2
=
3
n
+
1
−
1
2
a 
n
​	
 = 
2
3
​	
 ⋅3 
n
 − 
2
1
​	
 = 
2
3 
n+1
 
​	
 − 
2
1
​	
 = 
2
3 
n+1
 −1
​	
 
now, since the original expression is 
e
=
3
a
9
e=3a 
9
​	
 , because there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3.

wait, let's verify that. the expression is:

e
=
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
(
1
+
3
)
)
)
)
)
)
)
)
)
e=3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))
counting the number of 3's inside, starting from the innermost:

1. innermost: 
1
+
3
1+3 → 
a
1
a 
1
​	
 

2. next: 
1
+
3
(
a
1
)
1+3(a 
1
​	
 ) → 
a
2
a 
2
​	
 

3. next: 
1
+
3
(
a
2
)
1+3(a 
2
​	
 ) → 
a
3
a 
3
​	
 

4. ...

5. up to 
a
9
a 
9
​	
 

then, the entire expression is 
3
(
a
9
)
3(a 
9
​	
 ).

so, 
e
=
3
a
9
e=3a 
9
​	
 

using the closed-form formula:

a
n
=
3
n
+
1
−
1
2
a 
n
​	
 = 
2
3 
n+1
 −1
​	
 
so,

a
9
=
3
10
−
1
2
a 
9
​	
 = 
2
3 
10
 −1
​	
 
now, 
3
10
=
59049
3 
10
 =59049, so:

a
9
=
59049
−
1
2
=
59048
2
=
29524
a 
9
​	
 = 
2
59049−1
​	
 = 
2
59048
​	
 =29524
therefore, the entire expression is:

e
=
3
×
29524
=
88572
e=3×29524=88572
wait a minute, let's double-check that calculation.

first, confirm 
3
10
3 
10
 :

3
1
=
3
3 
1
 =3

3
2
=
9
3 
2
 =9

3
3
=
27
3 
3
 =27

3
4
=
81
3 
4
 =81

3
5
=
243
3 
5
 =243

3
6
=
729
3 
6
 =729

3
7
=
2187
3 
7
 =2187

3
8
=
6561
3 
8
 =6561

3
9
=
19683
3 
9
 =19683

3
10
=
59049
3 
10
 =59049

yes, that's correct.

then, 
a
9
=
59049
−
1
2
=
59048
2
=
29524
a 
9
​	
 = 
2
59049−1
​	
 = 
2
59048
​	
 =29524

then, 
e
=
3
×
29524
=
88572
e=3×29524=88572

so, the final answer should be 88,572.

but just to be thorough, maybe i should verify this by expanding a few more layers manually to ensure the pattern holds.

let's compute 
a
4
a 
4
​	
  again:

a
4
=
1
+
3
a
3
=
1
+
3
(
40
)
=
1
+
120
=
121
a 
4
​	
 =1+3a 
3
​	
 =1+3(40)=1+120=121
using the formula:

a
4
=
3
5
−
1
2
=
243
−
1
2
=
242
2
=
121
a 
4
​	
 = 
2
3 
5
 −1
​	
 = 
2
243−1
​	
 = 
2
242
​	
 =121
matches.

similarly, 
a
5
=
1
+
3
(
121
)
=
1
+
363
=
364
a 
5
​	
 =1+3(121)=1+363=364

using the formula:

a
5
=
3
6
−
1
2
=
729
−
1
2
=
728
2
=
364
a 
5
​	
 = 
2
3 
6
 −1
​	
 = 
2
729−1
​	
 = 
2
728
​	
 =364
good, it matches.

so, it seems the formula is correct. therefore, the final answer is indeed 88,572.

**final answer**

88572
