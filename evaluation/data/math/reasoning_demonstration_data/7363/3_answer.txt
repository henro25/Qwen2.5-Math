Answer: To solve the given expression:

\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \]

we start by identifying the innermost expression and work our way outward. we define a sequence \( a_n \) where each term is given by:

\[ a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \]

with the initial condition \( a_1 = 4 \). we solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula. the general solution is:

\[ a_n = \frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \]

given that the original expression is \( 3a_9 \), we calculate \( a_9 \):

\[ a_9 = \frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \frac{59049 - 1}{2} = \frac{59048}{2} = 29524 \]

thus, the entire expression is:

\[ 3 \times 29524 = 88572 \]

therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{88572}
\]
