Problem: A particle moves in the Cartesian plane according to the following rules:
From any lattice point $(a,b),$ the particle may only move to $(a+1,b), (a,b+1),$ or $(a+1,b+1).$
There are no right angle turns in the particle's path.
How many different paths can the particle take from $(0,0)$ to $(5,5)$?
