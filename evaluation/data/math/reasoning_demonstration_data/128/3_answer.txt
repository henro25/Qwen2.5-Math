Answer: To find the number of real roots of the equation

\[
\begin{vmatrix} x & c & -b \\ -c & x & a \\ b & -a & x \end{vmatrix} = 0,
\]

we start by computing the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix. using the rule for determinants, we have:

\[
\begin{vmatrix} 
x & c & -b \\ 
-c & x & a \\ 
b & -a & x 
\end{vmatrix}
= x(x^2 + a^2) - c(-c x + a b) - b(c a - x b).
\]

simplifying each term:

\[
x(x^2 + a^2) = x^3 + a^2 x,
\]
\[
-c(-c x + a b) = c(c x - a b) = c^2 x - a b c,
\]
\[
-b(c a - x b) = -b c a + b^2 x.
\]

combining these, we get:

\[
x^3 + a^2 x + c^2 x - a b c - b c a + b^2 x = x^3 + (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)x = 0.
\]

this simplifies to:

\[
x(x^2 + a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = 0.
\]

given that \(a, b, c\) are nonzero real numbers, \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 > 0\). therefore, the equation \(x^2 + a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 0\) has no real solutions because \(x^2\) is always non-negative and cannot equal a negative number.

thus, the only real root is \(x = 0\).

to confirm, we check the determinant at \(x = 0\):

\[
\begin{vmatrix} 0 & c & -b \\ -c & 0 & a \\ b & -a & 0 \end{vmatrix} = 0 + a b c - a b c = 0.
\]

hence, \(x = 0\) is indeed a root, and it is a simple root since the derivative at \(x = 0\) is positive.

therefore, the number of real roots is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]
