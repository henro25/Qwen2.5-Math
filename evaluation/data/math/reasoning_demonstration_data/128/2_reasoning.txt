Reasoning: So i've got this determinant equation to solve. it looks like this:

∣
x
c
−
b
−
c
x
a
b
−
a
x
∣
=
0.
​
  
x
−c
b
​
  
c
x
−a
​
  
−b
a
x
​
  
​
 =0.
and i need to find the number of real roots for this equation, given that a, b, and c are nonzero real numbers. hmm, determinants can be tricky, but i think i can handle this step by step.

first, i need to recall how to compute the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. the general formula for the determinant of a matrix:

∣
m
11
m
12
m
13
m
21
m
22
m
23
m
31
m
32
m
33
∣
​
  
m 
11
​
 
m 
21
​
 
m 
31
​
 
​
  
m 
12
​
 
m 
22
​
 
m 
32
​
 
​
  
m 
13
​
 
m 
23
​
 
m 
33
​
 
​
  
​
 
is:

m
11
(
m
22
m
33
−
m
23
m
32
)
−
m
12
(
m
21
m
33
−
m
23
m
31
)
+
m
13
(
m
21
m
32
−
m
22
m
31
)
.
m 
11
​
 (m 
22
​
 m 
33
​
 −m 
23
​
 m 
32
​
 )−m 
12
​
 (m 
21
​
 m 
33
​
 −m 
23
​
 m 
31
​
 )+m 
13
​
 (m 
21
​
 m 
32
​
 −m 
22
​
 m 
31
​
 ).
so, applying this to our matrix:

∣
x
c
−
b
−
c
x
a
b
−
a
x
∣
​
  
x
−c

​

​
  
​
 
let's compute each part step by step.

first term: 
x
×
(
x
⋅
x
−
a
⋅
(
−
a
)
)
=
x
(
x
2
+
a
2
)
x×(x⋅x−a⋅(−a))=x(x 
2
 +a 
2
 ).

second term: 
−
c

(
−
c
⋅
x
−
a
⋅

)
=
−
c
(
−

)
=
c
(
c

+

)
−c×(−c⋅x−a⋅b)=−c(−cx−ab)=c(cx+ab).

third term: 
−
b
×
(
−
c
⋅
(
−

)
−
x
⋅
b
)
=
−
b
(

)
=
−
b
(
c

−
x

)
=
−
b
c
a
+
b
x
b
=
−
b
c
a
+
b
2
x
−b×(−c⋅(−a)−x⋅b)=−b(ca−xb)=−b(ca−xb)=−bca+bxb=−bca+b 
2
 x.

now, adding them up:

x
(
x
2
+
a
2
)
+
c
(
c
x
+
a
b
)
+
(
−
b
c
a
+
b
2
x
)
=
0.
x(x 
2
 +a 
2
 )+c(cx+ab)+(−bca+b 
2
 x)=0.
let's expand and simplify this expression.

first, expand 
x
(
x
2
+
a
2
)
x(x 
2
 +a 
2
 ):

x
3
+
a
2
x
.
x 
3
 +a 
2
 x.
then, expand 
c
(
c
x
+
a
b
)
c(cx+ab):

c
2
x
+
a
b
c
.
c 
2
 x+abc.
and we have the third part:

−
b
c
a
+
b
2
x
.
−bca+b 
2
 x.
now, combine all these:

x
3
+
a
2
x
+
c
2
x
+
a
b
c
−
b
c
a
+
b
2
x
=
0.
x 
3
 +a 
2
 x+c 
2
 x+abc−bca+b 
2
 x=0.
wait a minute, 
a
b
c
−
b
c
a
abc−bca cancels out to zero.

so, the equation simplifies to:

x
3
+
a
2
x
+
c
2
x
+
b
2
x
=
0.
x 
3
 +a 
2
 x+c 
2
 x+b 
2
 x=0.
combine like terms:

x
3
+
(
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
)
x
=
0.
x 
3
 +(a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 )x=0.
factor out an x:

x
(
x
2
+
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
)
=
0.
x(x 
2
 +a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 )=0.
so, the solutions are:

x
=
0
or
x
2
+
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
=
0.
x=0orx 
2
 +a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 =0.
now, since a, b, and c are nonzero real numbers, 
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
>
0
a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 >0.

therefore, 
x
2
+
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
=
0
x 
2
 +a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 =0 implies 
x
2
=
−
(
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
)
x 
2
 =−(a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 ).

but the right-hand side is negative, and 
x
2
x 
2
  is always non-negative for real x. so, there are no real solutions to 
x
2
+
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
=
0
x 
2
 +a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 =0.

hence, the only real root is 
x
=
0
x=0.

wait, but i need to make sure that 
x
=
0
x=0 is indeed a solution.

plugging 
x
=
0
x=0 back into the original determinant:

∣
0
c
−
b
−
c
0
a
b
−
a
0
∣
.
​
  
0
−c
b
​
  
c
0
−a
​
  
−b
a
0
​
  
​
 .
compute this determinant:

first term: 
0
×
(
0
⋅
0
−
a
⋅
(
−
a
)
)
=
0
×
(
0
+
a
2
)
=
0
0×(0⋅0−a⋅(−a))=0×(0+a 
2
 )=0.

second term: 
−
c
×
(
−
c
⋅
0
−
a
⋅
b
)
=
−
c
×
(
0
−
a
b
)
=
−
c
×
(
−
a
b
)
=
a
b
c
−c×(−c⋅0−a⋅b)=−c×(0−ab)=−c×(−ab)=abc.

third term: 
−
b
×
(
−
c
⋅
(
−
a
)
−
0
⋅
b
)
=
−
b
×
(
c
a
−
0
)
=
−
b
×
c
a
=
−
a
b
c
−b×(−c⋅(−a)−0⋅b)=−b×(ca−0)=−b×ca=−abc.

so, total determinant: 
0
+
a
b
c
−
a
b
c
=
0
0+abc−abc=0.

therefore, 
x
=
0
x=0 is indeed a root.

now, are there any other real roots?

from the equation 
x
(
x
2
+
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
)
=
0
x(x 
2
 +a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 )=0, as we saw, 
x
2
+
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
=
0
x 
2
 +a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 =0 has no real solutions because 
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
>
0
a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 >0.

therefore, the only real root is 
x
=
0
x=0.

so, the number of real roots is 1.

wait, but i should check if there are multiple roots at x=0, i.e., if x=0 is a multiple root.

looking back at the equation 
x
(
x
2
+
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
)
=
0
x(x 
2
 +a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 )=0, it's a cubic equation, and it factors into x times a quadratic that has no real roots.

therefore, x=0 is a simple root, multiplicity 1.

hence, there is only one real root.

alternatively, to confirm, i can consider the derivative.

the original equation is 
x
(
x
2
+
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
)
=
0
x(x 
2
 +a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 )=0.

the derivative is 
(
x
2
+
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
)
+
x
(
2
x
)
=
2
x
2
+
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
(x 
2
 +a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 )+x(2x)=2x 
2
 +a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 .

at x=0, the derivative is 
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
>
0
a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 >0, so the function crosses the x-axis at x=0 without touching it, confirming it's a simple root.

therefore, the number of real roots is indeed 1.
