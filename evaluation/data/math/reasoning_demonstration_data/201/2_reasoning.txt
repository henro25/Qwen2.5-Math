Reasoning: So i need to solve this inequality: 
x
2
−
2
x
>
35
x 
2
 −2x>35. hmm, okay, let's see. i'm a bit rusty on inequalities, but i remember that for quadratic inequalities, i should probably move everything to one side and then factor or use the quadratic formula.

first, let's rewrite the inequality to set it greater than zero. so, subtract 35 from both sides:

x
2
−
2
x
−
35
>
0
x 
2
 −2x−35>0

now, i need to factor this quadratic expression if possible. let's look for two numbers that multiply to -35 and add up to -2. hmm, -7 and 5? let's check: -7 * 5 = -35 and -7 + 5 = -2. perfect! so, the factored form is:

(
x
−
7
)
(
x
+
5
)
>
0
(x−7)(x+5)>0

okay, now i need to find the values of x that make this product positive. i recall that the product of two numbers is positive if both are positive or both are negative.

first, let's find the roots of the equation 
(
x
−
7
)
(
x
+
5
)
=
0
(x−7)(x+5)=0, which are x = 7 and x = -5. these points divide the number line into three intervals:

1. 
x
<
−
5
x<−5

2. 
−
5
<
x
<
7
−5<x<7

3. 
x
>
7
x>7

i need to test each interval to see where the product is positive.

let's take a test point in each interval:

1. for 
x
<
−
5
x<−5, let's pick x = -6:

(
−
6
−
7
)
(
−
6
+
5
)
=
(
−
13
)
(
−
1
)
=
13
(−6−7)(−6+5)=(−13)(−1)=13, which is positive.

2. for 
−
5
<
x
<
7
−5<x<7, let's pick x = 0:

(
0
−
7
)
(
0
+
5
)
=
(
−
7
)
(
5
)
=
−
35
(0−7)(0+5)=(−7)(5)=−35, which is negative.

3. for 
x
>
7
x>7, let's pick x = 8:

(
8
−
7
)
(
8
+
5
)
=
(
1
)
(
13
)
=
13
(8−7)(8+5)=(1)(13)=13, which is positive.

so, the product is positive in the intervals 
x
<
−
5
x<−5 and 
x
>
7
x>7.

therefore, the solution in interval notation should be the union of these two intervals.

wait a minute, is that all? let me double-check. sometimes, i might forget to consider the equality, but since the inequality is strict (>), not ≥, i don't include the endpoints.

also, just to make sure, maybe i should sketch the graph of the quadratic function 
y
=
x
2
−
2
x
−
35
y=x 
2
 −2x−35. since the coefficient of 
x
2
x 
2
  is positive, the parabola opens upwards. the roots are at x = -5 and x = 7, so the parabola crosses the x-axis at these points. the function is above the x-axis (positive) to the left of x = -5 and to the right of x = 7, which matches what i found earlier.

so, the solution should be 
x
<
−
5
x<−5 or 
x
>
7
x>7, which in interval notation is:

(
−
∞
,
−
5
)
∪
(
7
,
∞
)
(−∞,−5)∪(7,∞)

i think that's it!

**final answer**

(
−
∞
,
−
5
)
∪
(
7
,
∞
)
(−∞,−5)∪(7,∞)
