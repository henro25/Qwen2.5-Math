Answer: To solve the inequality \( x^2 - 2x > 35 \), we first rewrite it as:

\[ x^2 - 2x - 35 > 0 \]

next, we factor the quadratic expression:

\[ (x - 7)(x + 5) > 0 \]

we find the roots of the equation \( (x - 7)(x + 5) = 0 \), which are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -5 \). these points divide the number line into three intervals:

1. \( x < -5 \)
2. \( -5 < x < 7 \)
3. \( x > 7 \)

we test each interval to determine where the product is positive:

1. for \( x < -5 \), let \( x = -6 \):
   \[ (-6 - 7)(-6 + 5) = (-13)(-1) = 13 \] (positive)

2. for \( -5 < x < 7 \), let \( x = 0 \):
   \[ (0 - 7)(0 + 5) = (-7)(5) = -35 \] (negative)

3. for \( x > 7 \), let \( x = 8 \):
   \[ (8 - 7)(8 + 5) = (1)(13) = 13 \] (positive)

thus, the product is positive in the intervals \( x < -5 \) and \( x > 7 \). therefore, the solution in interval notation is:

\[ \boxed{(-\infty, -5) \cup (7, \infty)} \]
