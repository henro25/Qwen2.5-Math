Reasoning: So i need to find the value of tan(7.5°) and express it in the form √a - √b + √c - d, where a, b, c, d are positive integers with a ≥ b ≥ c ≥ d. then, i have to find the sum a + b + c + d.

first, i know that 7.5° is half of 15°, so maybe i can use some half-angle formula here. let me recall the half-angle formula for tangent:

tan(θ/2) = (1 - cosθ) / sinθ or sinθ / (1 + cosθ)

i think the first one might be more useful here. so, if θ = 15°, then tan(7.5°) = tan(15°/2) = (1 - cos15°)/sin15°

i need to find expressions for cos15° and sin15°. i know that 15° is 45° - 30°, so i can use the cosine and sine of difference formulas.

cos(a - b) = cos a cos b + sin a sin b

sin(a - b) = sin a cos b - cos a sin b

so, cos15° = cos(45° - 30°) = cos45° cos30° + sin45° sin30°

similarly, sin15° = sin(45° - 30°) = sin45° cos30° - cos45° sin30°

i know the exact values for these angles:

cos45° = √2/2

cos30° = √3/2

sin45° = √2/2

sin30° = 1/2

plugging these in:

cos15° = (√2/2)(√3/2) + (√2/2)(1/2) = (√6)/4 + (√2)/4 = (√6 + √2)/4

sin15° = (√2/2)(√3/2) - (√2/2)(1/2) = (√6)/4 - (√2)/4 = (√6 - √2)/4

now, plug these back into the half-angle formula:

tan(7.5°) = (1 - cos15°)/sin15° = [1 - (√6 + √2)/4] / [(√6 - √2)/4]

let me simplify the numerator and denominator:

numerator: 1 - (√6 + √2)/4 = (4 - √6 - √2)/4

denominator: (√6 - √2)/4

so, tan(7.5°) = [(4 - √6 - √2)/4] / [(√6 - √2)/4] = (4 - √6 - √2)/(√6 - √2)

now, to simplify this expression, i can rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (√6 + √2):

tan(7.5°) = [(4 - √6 - √2)(√6 + √2)] / [(√6 - √2)(√6 + √2)]

first, compute the denominator:

(√6 - √2)(√6 + √2) = (√6)^2 - (√2)^2 = 6 - 2 = 4

now, compute the numerator:

(4 - √6 - √2)(√6 + √2) = 4*√6 + 4*√2 - √6*√6 - √6*√2 - √2*√6 - √2*√2

simplify each term:

4√6 + 4√2 - 6 - √12 - √12 - 2

now, √12 = 2√3, so:

4√6 + 4√2 - 6 - 2*2√3 - 2*2√3 - 2 = 4√6 + 4√2 - 6 - 4√3 - 4√3 - 2

combine like terms:

4√6 + 4√2 - 8√3 - 8

so, tan(7.5°) = [4√6 + 4√2 - 8√3 - 8] / 4

factor out a 4 from the numerator:

4(√6 + √2 - 2√3 - 2) / 4 = √6 + √2 - 2√3 - 2

so, tan(7.5°) = √6 + √2 - 2√3 - 2

but the problem wants it in the form √a - √b + √c - d, with a ≥ b ≥ c ≥ d.

looking at what i have: √6 + √2 - 2√3 - 2

i can rearrange the terms to match the desired form:

√6 - 2√3 + √2 - 2

now, let's identify a, b, c, d:

√a = √6 ⇒ a = 6

√b = 2√3 ⇒ wait, that's not right. √b should be a single square root, but here it's 2√3, which is different.

hmm, maybe i need to express 2√3 differently. let's see.

alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to express tan(7.5°). maybe i made a mistake in simplifying.

let me check my steps again.

starting from tan(7.5°) = (4 - √6 - √2)/(√6 - √2)

then, multiplying numerator and denominator by (√6 + √2), i get:

[ (4 - √6 - √2)(√6 + √2) ] / [ (√6 - √2)(√6 + √2) ] = [4√6 + 4√2 - 6 - √12 - √12 - 2] / [6 - 2] = [4√6 + 4√2 - 6 - 4√3 - 2] / 4

wait, earlier i had -8√3, but that seems off. let's recalculate the numerator:

(4 - √6 - √2)(√6 + √2) = 4*√6 + 4*√2 - √6*√6 - √6*√2 - √2*√6 - √2*√2

which is 4√6 + 4√2 - 6 - √12 - √12 - 2

now, √12 = 2√3, so:

4√6 + 4√2 - 6 - 2√3 - 2√3 - 2 = 4√6 + 4√2 - 4√3 - 8

wait, earlier i had -8√3 - 8, but that seems incorrect. it should be -4√3 - 8.

wait, let's check again:

-√6*√6 = -6

-√6*√2 = -√12 = -2√3

-√2*√6 = -√12 = -2√3

-√2*√2 = -2

so, total numerator: 4√6 + 4√2 - 6 - 2√3 - 2√3 - 2 = 4√6 + 4√2 - 4√3 - 8

so, numerator is 4√6 + 4√2 - 4√3 - 8

denominator is 4

thus, tan(7.5°) = (4√6 + 4√2 - 4√3 - 8)/4 = √6 + √2 - √3 - 2

okay, so now i have tan(7.5°) = √6 + √2 - √3 - 2

this looks better. now, the problem wants it in the form √a - √b + √c - d, with a ≥ b ≥ c ≥ d.

so, rearranging the terms:

√6 - √3 + √2 - 2

now, identify a, b, c, d:

√a = √6 ⇒ a = 6

√b = √3 ⇒ b = 3

√c = √2 ⇒ c = 2

d = 2

now, check if a ≥ b ≥ c ≥ d: 6 ≥ 3 ≥ 2 ≥ 2, which holds.

so, a + b + c + d = 6 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 13

**final answer**
