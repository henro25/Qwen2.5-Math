Answer: The sum of the first 10 odd positive integers is **100**.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the First 10 Odd Positive Integers:**
   - Odd positive integers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19.

2. **Formula for the Sum of the First n Odd Numbers:**
   - The sum of the first n odd numbers is \( n^2 \).

3. **Apply the Formula for n = 10:**
   - Sum = \( 10^2 = 100 \).

Therefore, the sum of the first 10 odd positive integers is **100**.
