Reasoning: Alright, so I've got this problem: "What is the sum of the first 10 odd positive integers?" Let's see, first I need to understand what odd positive integers are. Odd numbers are numbers that aren't divisible by 2, like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. So, the first 10 odd positive integers would be 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19.

Okay, so I need to add these up. I could just add them one by one, but that seems time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way to do this. I've heard something about the sum of odd numbers having a pattern or formula. Let me think about it.

First, let's list them again: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19. Now, adding them up step by step:

1 + 3 = 4

4 + 5 = 9

9 + 7 = 16

16 + 9 = 25

25 + 11 = 36

36 + 13 = 49

49 + 15 = 64

64 + 17 = 81

81 + 19 = 100

So, the sum is 100. Wait, that's interesting. The sum of the first 10 odd numbers is 100, which is 10 squared. Is there a pattern here?

Let me try with smaller numbers to see if this pattern holds. Sum of first 1 odd number: 1, which is 1 squared.

Sum of first 2 odd numbers: 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2 squared.

Sum of first 3 odd numbers: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is 3 squared.

Sum of first 4 odd numbers: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, which is 4 squared.

Okay, it seems like the sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared. So, for n = 10, it should be 10 squared, which is 100.

But wait, is there a way to prove this? Maybe I can use mathematical induction or find a formula.

Let's see, the nth odd number can be represented as 2n - 1. So, the first 10 odd numbers are when n = 1 to 10: 1, 3, 5, ..., 19.

The sum S of the first n odd numbers is S = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1).

I recall that the sum of an arithmetic series is S = (n/2)(first term + last term).

Here, the first term is 1, and the last term is 2n - 1.

So, S = (n/2)(1 + (2n - 1)) = (n/2)(2n) = n^2.

Yes, that confirms it. So, for n = 10, S = 10^2 = 100.

Therefore, the sum of the first 10 odd positive integers is 100.
