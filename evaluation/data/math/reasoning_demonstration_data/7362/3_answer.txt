Answer: Given a large sphere with a volume of \(288\pi\) cubic units and a smaller sphere with a volume that is \(12.5\%\), or \(\frac{1}{8}\), of the larger sphere's volume, we need to find the ratio of the radius of the smaller sphere to the radius of the larger sphere.

first, we use the volume formula for a sphere, \(v = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), to find the radius of the larger sphere:

\[
\frac{4}{3}\pi r_{\text{large}}^3 = 288\pi
\]

canceling \(\pi\) from both sides:

\[
\frac{4}{3} r_{\text{large}}^3 = 288
\]

multiplying both sides by \(\frac{3}{4}\):

\[
r_{\text{large}}^3 = 288 \times \frac{3}{4} = 216
\]

taking the cube root:

\[
r_{\text{large}} = \sqrt[3]{216} = 6
\]

next, we find the volume of the smaller sphere:

\[
\text{volume of smaller sphere} = 0.125 \times 288\pi = 36\pi
\]

using the volume formula again for the smaller sphere:

\[
\frac{4}{3}\pi r_{\text{small}}^3 = 36\pi
\]

canceling \(\pi\) from both sides:

\[
\frac{4}{3} r_{\text{small}}^3 = 36
\]

multiplying both sides by \(\frac{3}{4}\):

\[
r_{\text{small}}^3 = 36 \times \frac{3}{4} = 27
\]

taking the cube root:

\[
r_{\text{small}} = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3
\]

the ratio of the radius of the smaller sphere to the radius of the larger sphere is:

\[
\frac{r_{\text{small}}}{r_{\text{large}}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}
\]
