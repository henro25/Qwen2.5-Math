Reasoning: So i've got this problem here about spheres and their volumes. let's see... a large sphere has a volume of 288π cubic units, and a smaller sphere has a volume that's 12.5% of that larger sphere's volume. i need to find the ratio of the radius of the smaller sphere to the radius of the larger sphere, and express it as a common fraction.

first things first, i should probably recall the formula for the volume of a sphere. i think it's v = (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius. yeah, that sounds right.

so, for the larger sphere, its volume is given as 288π. let's set that equal to the formula:

(4/3)πr_large³ = 288π

hmm, i can probably cancel out the π from both sides since it's on both sides of the equation. so, (4/3)r_large³ = 288.

now, to solve for r_large³, i can multiply both sides by 3/4:

r_large³ = 288 * (3/4)

let's calculate that: 288 * 3 is 864, and 864 divided by 4 is 216. so, r_large³ = 216.

to find r_large, i need to take the cube root of 216. i know that 6³ is 216, so r_large = 6 units.

alright, now for the smaller sphere. its volume is 12.5% of the larger sphere's volume. so, 12.5% of 288π.

let's calculate that: 0.125 * 288π = 36π cubic units.

so, the volume of the smaller sphere is 36π.

using the volume formula again for the smaller sphere:

(4/3)πr_small³ = 36π

again, π cancels out, so (4/3)r_small³ = 36.

multiply both sides by 3/4:

r_small³ = 36 * (3/4) = 27

now, r_small is the cube root of 27, which is 3 units.

so, the radius of the smaller sphere is 3 units, and the radius of the larger sphere is 6 units.

the problem asks for the ratio of the smaller radius to the larger radius, so that's 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2.

wait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe i should double-check if there's something i'm missing.

is there a more general way to approach this without calculating the actual radii? like, using the properties of similar figures or something?

well, volumes of similar figures scale with the cube of the ratio of their corresponding linear dimensions. so, if the smaller sphere is scaled down by a factor of k from the larger sphere, then its volume should be k³ times the volume of the larger sphere.

given that the smaller volume is 12.5% of the larger volume, which is the same as 1/8, since 12.5% is 1/8.

so, k³ = 1/8, which means k = (1/8)^(1/3) = 1/2.

so, the ratio of the radii is 1/2.

wait, that matches what i got earlier by calculating the actual radii. good, that confirms my answer.

i think that's it. the ratio is 1/2.
