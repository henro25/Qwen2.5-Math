Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: there's a planning committee with 10 members, and exactly four of them are teachers. i need to form a four-person subcommittee, and it has to have at least one teacher. the question is asking for the number of distinct subcommittees possible under these conditions.

first, i need to understand what "distinct subcommittees" means. i think it means that the order in which we select the members doesn't matter; it's just about who is in the subcommittee, not the order they're listed in. so, this sounds like a combination problem.

the total number of ways to choose any four members from the 10, without any restrictions, would be the combination of 10 choose 4, which is written as c(10,4). i know that the formula for combinations is c(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where "n!" means n factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to n.

so, c(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10*9*8*7) / (4*3*2*1) = 210.

but wait, the problem says there must be at least one teacher in the subcommittee. so, if i just calculate c(10,4), that includes all possible four-member groups, some of which might have no teachers at all. i need to exclude those subcommittees that have no teachers.

so, how many subcommittees have no teachers? well, there are 10 members total, and 4 are teachers, which means there are 10 - 4 = 6 non-teachers.

so, the number of ways to choose a four-person subcommittee with no teachers would be c(6,4), because i'm choosing all four members from the 6 non-teachers.

calculating c(6,4): 6! / (4! * (6-4)!) = 6! / (4! * 2!) = (6*5) / (2*1) = 15.

therefore, the number of subcommittees with at least one teacher would be the total number of subcommittees minus the number of subcommittees with no teachers.

so, that would be 210 (total) - 15 (no teachers) = 195.

therefore, there are 195 distinct subcommittees possible that include at least one teacher.

wait a minute, is there another way to approach this? maybe directly calculating the number of subcommittees with at least one teacher instead of subtracting the ones with no teachers from the total.

let's try that. if i want at least one teacher, that means the subcommittee could have 1, 2, 3, or 4 teachers.

so, i can calculate the number of subcommittees with exactly one teacher, plus exactly two teachers, plus exactly three teachers, plus exactly four teachers.

first, exactly one teacher: that would be choosing 1 teacher from 4 and 3 non-teachers from 6.

so, c(4,1) * c(6,3).

c(4,1) is 4.

c(6,3) is 6! / (3! * 3!) = (6*5*4)/(3*2*1) = 20.

so, 4 * 20 = 80.

next, exactly two teachers: c(4,2) * c(6,2).

c(4,2) = 6.

c(6,2) = 15.

so, 6 * 15 = 90.

then, exactly three teachers: c(4,3) * c(6,1).

c(4,3) = 4.

c(6,1) = 6.

so, 4 * 6 = 24.

finally, exactly four teachers: c(4,4) * c(6,0).

c(4,4) = 1.

c(6,0) = 1.

so, 1 * 1 = 1.

now, adding them all up: 80 + 90 + 24 + 1 = 195.

okay, so i get the same answer as before, which is reassuring. it looks like 195 is the correct number of distinct subcommittees that include at least one teacher.

i think this makes sense. both approaches led me to the same result, so i'm confident that 195 is the right answer.

**final answer**

195
