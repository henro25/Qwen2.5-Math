Reasoning: So i've got this problem here. it's about a sequence defined by some rules, and i need to find how many positive integers a₁ ≤ 2008 satisfy the condition that a₁ is less than each of a₂, a₃, and a₄. alright, let's break this down step by step.

first, i need to understand the sequence rule:

- if aₙ₋₁ is even, then aₙ = aₙ₋₁ / 2.

- if aₙ₋₁ is odd, then aₙ = 3aₙ₋₁ + 1.

so, starting from a₁, i can generate a sequence using these rules. the problem asks for how many a₁ ≤ 2008, a₁ < a₂, a₁ < a₃, and a₁ < a₄.

i need to find a₁ such that a₁ < a₂, a₁ < a₃, and a₁ < a₄.

let me think about what a₂, a₃, and a₄ are in terms of a₁.

first, a₂ depends directly on a₁:

- if a₁ is even, a₂ = a₁ / 2.

- if a₁ is odd, a₂ = 3a₁ + 1.

wait a minute, if a₁ is even, a₂ = a₁ / 2, which would be less than a₁ because dividing by 2 makes it smaller (since a₁ is positive). but the problem says a₁ < a₂, so if a₁ is even, a₂ = a₁ / 2 < a₁, which would violate the condition a₁ < a₂. therefore, for a₁ even, a₂ < a₁, so the condition a₁ < a₂ is not satisfied.

therefore, a₁ must be odd for a₁ < a₂ to hold because if a₁ is odd, a₂ = 3a₁ + 1, which is definitely greater than a₁ (since 3a₁ + 1 > a₁ for all positive integers a₁).

so, first conclusion: a₁ must be odd.

now, i need to ensure that a₁ < a₃ and a₁ < a₄.

let me express a₃ and a₄ in terms of a₁.

since a₁ is odd, a₂ = 3a₁ + 1.

now, a₂ could be even or odd. let's see:

- a₂ = 3a₁ + 1.

since a₁ is odd, 3a₁ is odd, and adding 1 makes it even. therefore, a₂ is even.

given that a₂ is even, a₃ = a₂ / 2 = (3a₁ + 1)/2.

now, a₃ could be even or odd, depending on a₁.

then, a₄ depends on whether a₃ is even or odd.

so, let's compute a₃ and a₄ in terms of a₁.

we have:

a₂ = 3a₁ + 1 (even)

a₃ = (3a₁ + 1)/2

now, to find a₄, we need to determine if a₃ is even or odd.

let me consider two cases based on a₁ modulo 4, since a₁ is odd.

if a₁ is odd, it can be written as a₁ = 2k + 1 for some integer k ≥ 0.

then, a₂ = 3(2k + 1) + 1 = 6k + 3 + 1 = 6k + 4 = 2(3k + 2), which is even.

a₃ = (6k + 4)/2 = 3k + 2

now, a₃ = 3k + 2.

i need to find out if a₃ is even or odd.

3k + 2:

- if k is even, say k = 2m, then a₃ = 3(2m) + 2 = 6m + 2, which is even.

- if k is odd, say k = 2m + 1, then a₃ = 3(2m + 1) + 2 = 6m + 3 + 2 = 6m + 5, which is odd.

so, a₃ is even when k is even, and odd when k is odd.

therefore, a₄ depends on whether a₃ is even or odd.

let's consider both cases.

case 1: k even (i.e., a₁ ≡ 1 mod 4)

then, a₃ = 3k + 2 is even.

therefore, a₄ = a₃ / 2 = (3k + 2)/2

case 2: k odd (i.e., a₁ ≡ 3 mod 4)

then, a₃ = 3k + 2 is odd.

therefore, a₄ = 3a₃ + 1 = 3(3k + 2) + 1 = 9k + 6 + 1 = 9k + 7

now, i need to ensure that a₁ < a₃ and a₁ < a₄.

let's recall that a₁ = 2k + 1.

first, a₁ < a₃.

a₁ = 2k + 1

a₃ = 3k + 2

so, 2k + 1 < 3k + 2 → 2k + 1 < 3k + 2 → 1 - 2 < 3k - 2k → -1 < k

since k is a non-negative integer (k ≥ 0), this inequality holds for all k ≥ 0.

therefore, a₁ < a₃ is always true for odd a₁.

next, a₁ < a₄.

we have two cases for a₄:

case 1: a₁ ≡ 1 mod 4 (k even)

a₄ = (3k + 2)/2

so, a₁ < a₄ → 2k + 1 < (3k + 2)/2

multiply both sides by 2: 4k + 2 < 3k + 2 → 4k + 2 < 3k + 2 → 4k - 3k < 2 - 2 → k < 0

but k ≥ 0, so k < 0 is not possible. therefore, in this case, a₁ < a₄ is never true.

wait, that's strange. according to this, for a₁ ≡ 1 mod 4, a₁ < a₄ is never true, but we already have a₁ < a₃.

but the problem requires a₁ < a₂, a₃, and a₄. so, if a₁ < a₄ is not true in this case, then these a₁'s don't satisfy the condition.

case 2: a₁ ≡ 3 mod 4 (k odd)

a₄ = 9k + 7

we have a₁ = 2k + 1

so, a₁ < a₄ → 2k + 1 < 9k + 7 → 2k + 1 < 9k + 7 → 1 - 7 < 9k - 2k → -6 < 7k → k > -6/7

since k is a non-negative integer, this inequality holds for all k ≥ 0.

therefore, in this case, a₁ < a₄ is always true.

so, summarizing:

- a₁ must be odd.

- if a₁ ≡ 1 mod 4, then a₁ < a₄ is not true.

- if a₁ ≡ 3 mod 4, then a₁ < a₄ is true.

therefore, only a₁'s that are odd and ≡ 3 mod 4 satisfy a₁ < a₂, a₃, and a₄.

wait, but earlier i concluded that for a₁ even, a₂ < a₁, which violates a₁ < a₂, so a₁ must be odd.

and among odd a₁'s, only those ≡ 3 mod 4 satisfy a₁ < a₄.

therefore, the numbers we're interested in are the odd integers a₁ ≤ 2008 with a₁ ≡ 3 mod 4.

now, i need to find how many such a₁'s there are.

first, find the number of integers a ≤ 2008 where a is odd and a ≡ 3 mod 4.

in other words, a ≡ 3 mod 4.

because in the odd numbers, half are ≡1 mod 4 and half are ≡3 mod 4.

wait, but let's be precise.

the numbers ≡3 mod 4 are 3,7,11,15,... up to 2007, since 2008 is even.

first, find the smallest a₁ ≥1 that is ≡3 mod 4: a₁=3.

largest a₁ ≤2008 that is ≡3 mod 4: since 2008 is divisible by 4 (2008 /4=502), so 2008 ≡0 mod4, so 2007 ≡ -1 ≡3 mod4.

so, the sequence is 3,7,11,...,2007.

this is an arithmetic sequence with first term 3, common difference 4, last term 2007.

the number of terms is given by n = ((last - first)/difference) +1 = ((2007 - 3)/4) +1 = (2004/4)+1 = 501 +1 = 502.

therefore, there are 502 positive integers a₁ ≤2008 that are odd and ≡3 mod4.

wait, but let's confirm if all these satisfy a₁ < a₂, a₃, and a₄.

we already saw that for a₁ odd, a₂=3a₁+1 > a₁.

a₃=(3a₁+1)/2.

and for a₁ ≡3 mod4, a₄=9k+7 where k=(a₁-1)/2 is odd.

wait, but earlier we saw that for a₁ ≡3 mod4, a₄=9k+7, and a₁=2k+1.

we have a₁ < a₄, which holds since 2k+1 < 9k+7 for all k ≥0.

so, yes, for these a₁'s, a₁ < a₄.

also, a₁ < a₃, which we already saw holds for all odd a₁.

therefore, all a₁'s that are odd and ≡3 mod4 satisfy the condition a₁ < a₂, a₃, and a₄.

thus, the answer is the number of a₁ ≤2008 with a₁ odd and a₁ ≡3 mod4, which is 502.

but wait, i should double-check if there are any exceptions or if i missed something.

let me consider a small example.

take a₁=3.

then, a₂=3*3+1=10.

a₃=10/2=5.

a₄=3*5+1=16.

so, a₁=3 < a₂=10, a₁=3 < a₃=5, a₁=3 < a₄=16.

good.

another example: a₁=7.

a₂=3*7+1=22.

a₃=22/2=11.

a₄=3*11+1=34.

so, 7 <22, 7<11, 7<34.

good.

another example: a₁=11.

a₂=3*11+1=34.

a₃=34/2=17.

a₄=3*17+1=52.

11 <34, 11<17, 11<52.

good.

one more: a₁=15.

a₂=3*15+1=46.

a₃=46/2=23.

a₄=3*23+1=70.

15 <46, 15<23, 15<70.

good.

seems consistent.

therefore, the answer should be 502.

**final answer**
