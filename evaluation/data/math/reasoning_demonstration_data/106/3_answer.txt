Answer: Given the sequence rule:
- if \( a_{n-1} \) is even, then \( a_n = \frac{a_{n-1}}{2} \).
- if \( a_{n-1} \) is odd, then \( a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1 \).

we need to find how many positive integers \( a_1 \leq 2008 \) satisfy \( a_1 < a_2 \), \( a_1 < a_3 \), and \( a_1 < a_4 \).

1. **determine \( a_2 \), \( a_3 \), and \( a_4 \) in terms of \( a_1 \):**
   - if \( a_1 \) is even, \( a_2 = \frac{a_1}{2} \), which is less than \( a_1 \). thus, \( a_1 \) must be odd.
   - if \( a_1 \) is odd, \( a_2 = 3a_1 + 1 \), which is greater than \( a_1 \).

2. **for \( a_1 \) odd:**
   - \( a_2 = 3a_1 + 1 \) (even)
   - \( a_3 = \frac{3a_1 + 1}{2} \)
   - \( a_4 \) depends on whether \( a_3 \) is even or odd.

3. **consider \( a_1 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \):**
   - \( a_3 = \frac{3a_1 + 1}{2} \) is even.
   - \( a_4 = \frac{3a_1 + 1}{4} \)
   - \( a_1 < a_4 \) is not generally true.

4. **consider \( a_1 \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \):**
   - \( a_3 = \frac{3a_1 + 1}{2} \) is odd.
   - \( a_4 = 3 \left( \frac{3a_1 + 1}{2} \right) + 1 = \frac{9a_1 + 5}{2} \)
   - \( a_1 < a_4 \) is always true.

5. **count the numbers \( a_1 \leq 2008 \) that are odd and \( a_1 \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \):**
   - the sequence is \( 3, 7, 11, \ldots, 2007 \).
   - this is an arithmetic sequence with first term 3, common difference 4, and last term 2007.
   - number of terms: \( n = \left( \frac{2007 - 3}{4} \right) + 1 = 502 \).

thus, the number of positive integers \( a_1 \leq 2008 \) that satisfy the conditions is \(\boxed{502}\).
