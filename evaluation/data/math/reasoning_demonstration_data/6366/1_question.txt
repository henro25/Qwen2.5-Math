Problem: A $33$-gon $P_1$ is drawn in the Cartesian plane.  The sum of the $x$-coordinates of the $33$ vertices equals $99$.  The midpoints of the sides of $P_1$ form a second $33$-gon, $P_2$.  Finally, the midpoints of the sides of $P_2$ form a third $33$-gon, $P_3$.  Find the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_3$.
