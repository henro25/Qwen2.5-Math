Reasoning: To solve the problem:

1. **Determine the train's speed in miles per minute:**
   - The train moves at 60 miles per hour, which is 1 mile per minute.

2. **Calculate the distance the train travels in 3 minutes:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 1 mile/minute × 3 minutes = 3 miles.

3. **Relate this distance to the tunnel and train lengths:**
   - The distance traveled (3 miles) is equal to the length of the tunnel plus the length of the train.
   - Let the tunnel length be \( L \). Since the train is 1 mile long:
     \[
     L + 1 = 3
     \]
   - Solving for \( L \):
     \[
     L = 3 - 1 = 2 \text{ miles}
     \]

**Answer:** The tunnel is 2 miles long.
