Answer: To solve the problem of finding the maximum number of consecutive positive integers that can be added together without exceeding 400, we use the formula for the sum of the first $n$ consecutive positive integers:

\[
S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

We need to find the largest $n$ such that:

\[
\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \leq 400
\]

Multiplying both sides by 2:

\[
n(n + 1) \leq 800
\]

This simplifies to the quadratic inequality:

\[
n^2 + n - 800 \leq 0
\]

Solving the quadratic equation $n^2 + n - 800 = 0$ using the quadratic formula:

\[
n = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4 \times 800}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{3201}}{2}
\]

Approximating $\sqrt{3201} \approx 56.6$, we get:

\[
n \approx \frac{-1 + 56.6}{2} \approx 27.8
\]

Since $n$ must be an integer, we check $n = 27$ and $n = 28$:

- For $n = 27$: 

\[
S = \frac{27 \times 28}{2} = 378
\]

- For $n = 28$:

\[
S = \frac{28 \times 29}{2} = 406
\]

Since $406 > 400$, $n = 28$ is not acceptable, but $n = 27$ gives a sum of 378, which is under 400.

We also check if starting from a different integer $k$ allows for a larger $n$. However, increasing $k$ while keeping $n$ large results in sums that either exceed 400 or do not provide a larger $n$ than 27.

Thus, the maximum number of consecutive positive integers that can be added together without exceeding 400 is:

\[
\boxed{27}
\]
