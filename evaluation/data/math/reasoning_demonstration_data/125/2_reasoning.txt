Reasoning: Let's see. i've got this geometry problem here with some angles around a point. there's a figure where three lines are drawn from a common point, and there are angles labeled. one angle is 160 degrees, and the other two are both labeled as x degrees. i need to find the value of x.

first, i should recall some basic geometry principles. i know that the sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees. that seems relevant here because all these angles are around point a.

so, if i add up all the angles around point a, they should total 360 degrees. according to the figure, there are three angles: one that's 160 degrees and two that are both x degrees. so, the equation should be:

160 degrees + x degrees + x degrees = 360 degrees

that simplifies to:

160 + 2x = 360

now, i need to solve for x. to do that, i can subtract 160 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 360 - 160

2x = 200

then, divide both sides by 2 to find x:

x = 200 / 2

x = 100

wait a minute, is that all? it seems straightforward, but maybe i should double-check. let's visualize the figure again. there are three lines coming out from point a, creating three angles: one is 160 degrees, and the other two are both x degrees.

if i imagine standing at point a and looking along one of the lines, the angles would spread out around me. the total all-around should indeed be 360 degrees.

alternatively, i can think about the angles in terms of a full circle. since a circle is 360 degrees, and these angles are essentially slices of that circle emanating from the center point a, their sum should be 360 degrees.

another way to look at it is to consider that the three angles are like the angles between the hands of a clock if point a were the center of the clock. the angles between each hand would add up to the full circle.

so, my initial approach seems correct. adding up the angles to 360 degrees and solving for x gives x = 100 degrees.

but just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. perhaps using properties of triangles or other geometric shapes, but in this case, since it's just angles around a point, the sum should suffice.

let me consider if there are any special properties or theorems that apply here. for instance, if these lines were forming a triangle, there would be different angle sum properties, but here, they're just lines radiating from a common point, so the sum around the point is what matters.

is there a possibility that the angles might not sum to 360 degrees in this configuration? i don't think so; that's a fundamental property of angles around a point in a plane.

therefore, my solution should be correct. x equals 100 degrees.
