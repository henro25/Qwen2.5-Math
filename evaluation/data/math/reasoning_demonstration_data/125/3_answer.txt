Answer: To find the value of \( x \) in the given plane figure, we use the fact that the sum of angles around a point is \( 360^\circ \). the figure shows one angle of \( 160^\circ \) and two angles each labeled \( x^\circ \). therefore, we set up the equation:

\[
160^\circ + x^\circ + x^\circ = 360^\circ
\]

this simplifies to:

\[
160 + 2x = 360
\]

subtracting 160 from both sides, we get:

\[
2x = 200
\]

dividing both sides by 2, we find:

\[
x = 100
\]

thus, the value of \( x \) is \(\boxed{100}\).
