Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: i'm given two functions, f(x) = 6x - 9 and g(x) = x/3 + 2. i need to find f(g(x)) minus g(f(x)). okay, let's break this down step by step.

first, i need to understand what f(g(x)) means. that means i have to plug g(x) into f(x). so wherever i see an x in f(x), i replace it with g(x). so f(g(x)) would be 6 times g(x) minus 9. let's write that out:

f(g(x)) = 6 * g(x) - 9

now, since g(x) is x/3 + 2, i can substitute that in:

f(g(x)) = 6 * (x/3 + 2) - 9

okay, now i need to simplify that. first, distribute the 6:

6 * (x/3) is 6*(x/3) = 2x, because 6 divided by 3 is 2, and then times x is 2x.

6 * 2 is 12.

so f(g(x)) = 2x + 12 - 9

now, combine like terms: 12 - 9 is 3.

so f(g(x)) = 2x + 3

alright, that seems straightforward.

next, i need to find g(f(x)). that means plugging f(x) into g(x). so wherever there's an x in g(x), i replace it with f(x).

g(f(x)) = f(x)/3 + 2

given that f(x) = 6x - 9, substitute that in:

g(f(x)) = (6x - 9)/3 + 2

now, simplify that. first, divide each term in the numerator by 3:

(6x)/3 is 2x, and (-9)/3 is -3.

so g(f(x)) = 2x - 3 + 2

combine like terms: -3 + 2 is -1.

so g(f(x)) = 2x - 1

alright, now i have f(g(x)) = 2x + 3 and g(f(x)) = 2x - 1.

the problem asks for f(g(x)) - g(f(x)). so i need to subtract g(f(x)) from f(g(x)).

let's write that out:

f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = (2x + 3) - (2x - 1)

now, distribute the negative sign to the terms in the second parentheses:

2x + 3 - 2x + 1

combine like terms: 2x - 2x is 0, and 3 + 1 is 4.

so f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = 4

wait a minute, that seems too simple. did i do that right?

let me double-check.

starting with f(g(x)):

f(g(x)) = 6*(x/3 + 2) - 9 = 6*(x/3) + 6*2 - 9 = 2x + 12 - 9 = 2x + 3

that looks correct.

now g(f(x)):

g(f(x)) = (6x - 9)/3 + 2 = (6x)/3 - 9/3 + 2 = 2x - 3 + 2 = 2x - 1

that also looks correct.

then f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = (2x + 3) - (2x - 1) = 2x + 3 - 2x + 1 = (2x - 2x) + (3 + 1) = 0 + 4 = 4

hmm, maybe it is just 4. it seems counterintuitive because usually, these function compositions can be more complex, but in this case, the x terms cancel out, leaving a constant.

let me see if there's another way to approach this to confirm.

alternatively, i could think about what the composition of functions represents. f(g(x)) is applying g first, then f, and g(f(x)) is applying f first, then g.

but in this case, both compositions result in linear functions, and their difference is a constant.

another way to confirm is to plug in a specific value for x and see if the result is indeed 4.

let's choose x = 0.

first, find g(0):

g(0) = 0/3 + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2

then f(g(0)) = f(2) = 6*2 - 9 = 12 - 9 = 3

now find f(0):

f(0) = 6*0 - 9 = 0 - 9 = -9

then g(f(0)) = g(-9) = (-9)/3 + 2 = -3 + 2 = -1

now, f(g(0)) - g(f(0)) = 3 - (-1) = 4

okay, that matches the earlier result.

let's try another value, say x = 1.

first, g(1) = 1/3 + 2 = 1/3 + 6/3 = 7/3

then f(g(1)) = 6*(7/3) - 9 = 14 - 9 = 5

now f(1) = 6*1 - 9 = 6 - 9 = -3

then g(f(1)) = g(-3) = (-3)/3 + 2 = -1 + 2 = 1

so f(g(1)) - g(f(1)) = 5 - 1 = 4

again, 4. it seems consistent.

let me try one more, x = 2.

g(2) = 2/3 + 2 = 2/3 + 6/3 = 8/3

f(g(2)) = 6*(8/3) - 9 = 16 - 9 = 7

f(2) = 6*2 - 9 = 12 - 9 = 3

g(f(2)) = g(3) = 3/3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3

so f(g(2)) - g(f(2)) = 7 - 3 = 4

once again, 4.

okay, i'm pretty confident now that f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = 4.

but just to be thorough, maybe i should consider if there's a general proof or a different approach.

alternatively, i could consider the functions as linear transformations and see if there's a pattern.

f(x) = 6x - 9, which is a linear function with slope 6 and y-intercept -9.

g(x) = x/3 + 2, which is a linear function with slope 1/3 and y-intercept 2.

the composition f(g(x)) is another linear function, as we saw, 2x + 3.

similarly, g(f(x)) is 2x - 1.

subtracting them gives a constant, which suggests that the difference doesn't depend on x.

this makes sense because the x terms cancel out, leaving only the constants.

in general, if you have two linear functions and you compose them in both orders and subtract, the x terms might cancel if their coefficients are equal, as they are here (both 2x).

so, in this case, f(g(x)) has a 2x term and g(f(x)) also has a 2x term, so when you subtract them, 2x - 2x = 0, and you're left with the constants: 3 - (-1) = 4.

wait, actually, earlier i had f(g(x)) = 2x + 3 and g(f(x)) = 2x - 1, so f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = (2x + 3) - (2x - 1) = 2x + 3 - 2x + 1 = 4.

yes, that's correct.

alternatively, if i think in terms of function composition properties, in general, function composition is not commutative, meaning f(g(x)) is not necessarily equal to g(f(x)). however, in this specific case, their difference is a constant.

it's interesting to note that for linear functions, the composition often results in another linear function, and the difference between two linear functions with the same slope is indeed a constant.

so, in this problem, since both f(g(x)) and g(f(x)) have the same coefficient for x (both 2x), their difference eliminates the x term, leaving only the constants.

therefore, f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = 4.

i think that's the final answer.
