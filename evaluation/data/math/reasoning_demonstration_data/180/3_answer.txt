Answer: To determine how many integers between 0 and 8 inclusive have an inverse modulo 9, we check if each integer is coprime with 9, meaning their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. The numbers from 0 to 8 are:

- 0: GCD(0, 9) = 9 (no inverse)
- 1: GCD(1, 9) = 1 (has an inverse)
- 2: GCD(2, 9) = 1 (has an inverse)
- 3: GCD(3, 9) = 3 (no inverse)
- 4: GCD(4, 9) = 1 (has an inverse)
- 5: GCD(5, 9) = 1 (has an inverse)
- 6: GCD(6, 9) = 3 (no inverse)
- 7: GCD(7, 9) = 1 (has an inverse)
- 8: GCD(8, 9) = 1 (has an inverse)

The numbers that have inverses modulo 9 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, totaling 6 integers.

We can confirm this using Euler's totient function, φ(9), which gives the count of numbers less than 9 that are coprime with 9. Since 9 = 3², φ(9) = 9 * (1 - 1/3) = 6, which matches our count.

Thus, the number of integers between 0 and 8 that have an inverse modulo 9 is **6**.
