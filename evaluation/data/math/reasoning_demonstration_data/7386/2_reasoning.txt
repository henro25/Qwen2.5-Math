Reasoning: Let's see... i've got these two equations here:

3
a
=
8
1
b
+
2
3 
a
 =81 
b+2
 

and

12
5
b
=
5
a
−
3
125 
b
 =5 
a−3
 

i need to find the product 
a
b
ab. okay, first step, i should probably express everything with the same base numbers to make it easier to compare exponents. let's look at the first equation.

i know that 81 is a power of 3, right? because 
3
4
=
81
3 
4
 =81. so, i can rewrite 
8
1
b
+
2
81 
b+2
  as 
(
3
4
)
b
+
2
(3 
4
 ) 
b+2
 . using the power of a power rule, that would be 
3
4
(
b
+
2
)
3 
4(b+2)
 .

so now, the first equation becomes:

3
a
=
3
4
(
b
+
2
)
3 
a
 =3 
4(b+2)
 

since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. therefore:

a
=
4
(
b
+
2
)
a=4(b+2)

okay, that's one equation relating a and b. now, let's look at the second equation:

12
5
b
=
5
a
−
3
125 
b
 =5 
a−3
 

i know that 125 is a power of 5, specifically 
5
3
=
125
5 
3
 =125. so, i can rewrite 
12
5
b
125 
b
  as 
(
5
3
)
b
(5 
3
 ) 
b
 , which is 
5
3
b
5 
3b
 .

now, the second equation becomes:

5
3
b
=
5
a
−
3
5 
3b
 =5 
a−3
 

again, since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal:

3
b
=
a
−
3
3b=a−3

so now i have two equations:

1. 
a
=
4
(
b
+
2
)
a=4(b+2)

2. 
3
b
=
a
−
3
3b=a−3

i can use these two equations to solve for a and b. let's substitute the expression for a from the first equation into the second equation.

from equation 1:

a
=
4
b
+
8
a=4b+8

plug this into equation 2:

3
b
=
(
4
b
+
8
)
−
3
3b=(4b+8)−3

simplify the right side:

3
b
=
4
b
+
8
−
3
3b=4b+8−3

3
b
=
4
b
+
5
3b=4b+5

hmm, let's subtract 4b from both sides:

3
b
−
4
b
=
5
3b−4b=5

−
b
=
5
−b=5

so, 
b
=
−
5
b=−5

now, plug this back into equation 1 to find a:

a
=
4
(
−
5
+
2
)
a=4(−5+2)

a
=
4
(
−
3
)
a=4(−3)

a
=
−
12
a=−12

so, 
a
=
−
12
a=−12 and 
b
=
−
5
b=−5. the product 
a
b
ab is:

(
−
12
)
×
(
−
5
)
=
60
(−12)×(−5)=60

wait a minute, let me double-check these values in the original equations to make sure i didn't make a mistake.

first equation:

3
a
=
8
1
b
+
2
3 
a
 =81 
b+2
 

plug in a = -12 and b = -5:

left side: 
3
−
12
3 
−12
 

right side: 
8
1
−
5
+
2
=
8
1
−
3
81 
−5+2
 =81 
−3
 

but 
81
=
3
4
81=3 
4
 , so 
8
1
−
3
=
(
3
4
)
−
3
=
3
−
12
81 
−3
 =(3 
4
 ) 
−3
 =3 
−12
 

so, both sides equal 
3
−
12
3 
−12
 . good.

second equation:

12
5
b
=
5
a
−
3
125 
b
 =5 
a−3
 

plug in a = -12 and b = -5:

left side: 
12
5
−
5
125 
−5
 

right side: 
5
−
12
−
3
=
5
−
15
5 
−12−3
 =5 
−15
 

but 
125
=
5
3
125=5 
3
 , so 
12
5
−
5
=
(
5
3
)
−
5
=
5
−
15
125 
−5
 =(5 
3
 ) 
−5
 =5 
−15
 

again, both sides equal 
5
−
15
5 
−15
 . perfect, so my solutions for a and b are correct.

therefore, the product 
a
b
=
60
ab=60.

**final answer**

60
