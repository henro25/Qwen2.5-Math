Problem: An 8-foot by 10-foot floor is tiled with square tiles of size 1 foot by 1 foot. Each tile has a pattern consisting of four white quarter circles of radius 1/2 foot centered at each corner of the tile. The remaining portion of the tile is shaded. How many square feet of the floor are shaded?

fill((5,5)--(5,-5)--(-5,-5)--(-5,5)--cycle,gray(0.7));
fill(Circle((-5,5),5),white);
fill(Circle((5,5),5),white);
fill(Circle((-5,-5),5),white);
fill(Circle((5,-5),5),white);
draw((-5,5)--(-5,-5)--(5,-5)--(5,5)--cycle);
