Reasoning: Alright, so I have this problem here. It says that the points (9, -5) and (-3, -1) are the endpoints of a diameter of a circle, and I need to find the sum of the coordinates of the center of the circle. Okay, first things first, I need to find the center of the circle. Since these two points are endpoints of a diameter, the center should be the midpoint between them, right?

So, I remember that the midpoint formula is ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2). Let me apply that here. The x-coordinates are 9 and -3, so (9 + (-3))/2 = (6)/2 = 3. The y-coordinates are -5 and -1, so (-5 + (-1))/2 = (-6)/2 = -3. So, the center of the circle is at (3, -3).

Now, the problem asks for the sum of the coordinates of the center. That should just be 3 + (-3), which is 0. Wait, is that it? Seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.

I know that the center of a circle is indeed the midpoint of its diameter, so that part should be correct. And the midpoint formula seems right too. Let's plug in the numbers again to be sure. For the x-coordinate: 9 + (-3) is 6, divided by 2 is 3. For the y-coordinate: -5 + (-1) is -6, divided by 2 is -3. Yep, that matches what I got earlier.

And the sum of 3 and -3 is indeed 0. I don't think I missed anything here. It seems like a simple problem, but I guess it's just testing the understanding of the midpoint formula and basic arithmetic.
