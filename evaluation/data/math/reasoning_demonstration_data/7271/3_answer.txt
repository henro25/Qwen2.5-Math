Answer: To find the sum of the coordinates of the center of the circle, we first determine the center by calculating the midpoint of the diameter's endpoints, which are (9, -5) and (-3, -1).

1. **Calculate the midpoint (center) using the midpoint formula:**
   \[
   \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
   \]
   Substituting the coordinates:
   \[
   \left( \frac{9 + (-3)}{2}, \frac{-5 + (-1)}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{6}{2}, \frac{-6}{2} \right) = (3, -3)
   \]

2. **Sum the coordinates of the center:**
   \[
   3 + (-3) = 0
   \]

**Answer:** 0
