Problem: Find the equation of the plane passing through the point $(0,7,-7)$ and containing the line
\[\frac{x + 1}{-3} = \frac{y - 3}{2} = \frac{z + 2}{1}.\]Enter your answer in the form
\[Ax + By + Cz + D = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D$ are integers such that $A > 0$ and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|) = 1.$
