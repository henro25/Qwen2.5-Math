Reasoning: So i've got this problem here. it says that the vectors a, b, and c are mutually orthogonal, which means each pair of them is perpendicular to each other. that should be useful because i know that if vectors are orthogonal, their dot product is zero.

the vectors are:

a = [1, 1, 1]

b = [2, -3, 1]

c = [4, 1, -5]

and i need to find scalars p, q, and r such that:

[-4, 7, 3] = p*a + q*b + r*c

okay, since a, b, and c are mutually orthogonal, i can use the property of dot products to find p, q, and r individually. because if two vectors are orthogonal, their dot product is zero, which should simplify things.

first, i should verify that a, b, and c are indeed mutually orthogonal. that means:

a · b = 0

a · c = 0

b · c = 0

let me check that.

a · b = (1)(2) + (1)(-3) + (1)(1) = 2 - 3 + 1 = 0

a · c = (1)(4) + (1)(1) + (1)(-5) = 4 + 1 - 5 = 0

b · c = (2)(4) + (-3)(1) + (1)(-5) = 8 - 3 - 5 = 0

yes, they are mutually orthogonal. great.

now, since they are orthogonal, the coefficients p, q, and r can be found by taking the dot product of both sides of the equation with each of the vectors a, b, and c respectively.

let's see:

starting with the equation:

[-4, 7, 3] = p*a + q*b + r*c

let's take the dot product of both sides with a:

[-4, 7, 3] · a = p*(a · a) + q*(b · a) + r*(c · a)

but since b and c are orthogonal to a, their dot products with a are zero.

so:

[-4, 7, 3] · a = p*(a · a) + 0 + 0

therefore:

p = ([ -4, 7, 3 ] · a) / (a · a)

let's compute that.

first, compute a · a:

a · a = (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

then, [-4, 7, 3] · a = (-4)(1) + (7)(1) + (3)(1) = -4 + 7 + 3 = 6

so p = 6 / 3 = 2

okay, got p = 2

now, let's do the same for q by taking the dot product with b.

[-4, 7, 3] · b = p*(a · b) + q*(b · b) + r*(c · b)

again, a and c are orthogonal to b, so a · b = 0 and c · b = 0

thus:

[-4, 7, 3] · b = q*(b · b)

therefore:

q = ([ -4, 7, 3 ] · b) / (b · b)

compute b · b:

b · b = (2)^2 + (-3)^2 + (1)^2 = 4 + 9 + 1 = 14

then, [-4, 7, 3] · b = (-4)(2) + (7)(-3) + (3)(1) = -8 -21 + 3 = -26

so q = -26 / 14

wait, can that be simplified?

-26 divided by 14 is -13/7

so q = -13/7

hmm, that seems a bit messy, but maybe it's correct.

now, for r, take the dot product with c.

[-4, 7, 3] · c = p*(a · c) + q*(b · c) + r*(c · c)

again, a and b are orthogonal to c, so a · c = 0 and b · c = 0

thus:

[-4, 7, 3] · c = r*(c · c)

therefore:

r = ([ -4, 7, 3 ] · c) / (c · c)

compute c · c:

c · c = (4)^2 + (1)^2 + (-5)^2 = 16 + 1 + 25 = 42

then, [-4, 7, 3] · c = (-4)(4) + (7)(1) + (3)(-5) = -16 + 7 -15 = -24

so r = -24 / 42 = -12/21 = -4/7

wait, that's further simplifying.

so r = -4/7

alright, so summarizing:

p = 2

q = -13/7

r = -4/7

but let me check if this makes sense.

let me plug these back into the original equation and see if it holds.

compute p*a + q*b + r*c:

p*a = 2*[1,1,1] = [2,2,2]

q*b = (-13/7)*[2,-3,1] = [(-26)/7, 39/7, -13/7]

r*c = (-4/7)*[4,1,-5] = [(-16)/7, -4/7, 20/7]

now, add them up:

[2 + (-26/7) + (-16/7), 2 + 39/7 + (-4/7), 2 + (-13/7) + 20/7]

first component:

2 + (-26/7) + (-16/7) = 2 + (-42/7) = 2 - 6 = -4

second component:

2 + 39/7 - 4/7 = 2 + 35/7 = 2 + 5 = 7

third component:

2 + (-13/7) + 20/7 = 2 + 7/7 = 2 + 1 = 3

yes, it matches [-4,7,3], so the values of p, q, and r are correct.

but just to be thorough, i should make sure that i didn't make any calculation errors.

let's double-check the dot products and the divisions.

first, a · a = 1+1+1=3

[-4,7,3] · a = -4 + 7 + 3 = 6

p = 6/3 = 2, correct.

b · b = 4 + 9 + 1 = 14

[-4,7,3] · b = (-8) + (-21) + 3 = -26

q = -26 / 14 = -13/7, correct.

c · c = 16 + 1 + 25 = 42

[-4,7,3] · c = -16 + 7 -15 = -24

r = -24 / 42 = -12/21 = -4/7, correct.

looks good. so the ordered triple is (2, -13/7, -4/7)

i can leave it like that, or maybe write it with common denominators or something, but i think fractions are fine.
