Answer: To determine the value of \( a \) for which the equation \( 3(2x - a) = 2(3x + 12) \) has infinitely many solutions, we start by expanding both sides of the equation.

first, expand the left side:
\[
3(2x - a) = 6x - 3a
\]

next, expand the right side:
\[
2(3x + 12) = 6x + 24
\]

this gives us the equation:
\[
6x - 3a = 6x + 24
\]

to find the value of \( a \), we subtract \( 6x \) from both sides:
\[
-3a = 24
\]

solving for \( a \), we divide both sides by -3:
\[
a = \frac{24}{-3} = -8
\]

to verify, if \( a = -8 \), the original equation becomes:
\[
3(2x - (-8)) = 2(3x + 12)
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
3(2x + 8) = 2(3x + 12)
\]

expanding both sides again:
\[
6x + 24 = 6x + 24
\]

this equation is always true for any \( x \), confirming that there are infinitely many solutions when \( a = -8 \).

thus, the value of \( a \) that makes the equation have infinitely many solutions is:
\[
\boxed{-8}
\]
