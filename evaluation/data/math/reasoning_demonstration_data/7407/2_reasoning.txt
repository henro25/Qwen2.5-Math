Reasoning: So i have this equation here: 
3
(
2
x
−
a
)
=
2
(
3
x
+
12
)
3(2x−a)=2(3x+12), and i need to find the value of 
a
a that makes this equation have infinitely many solutions for 
x
x. okay, let's break this down.

first off, i know that for an equation to have infinitely many solutions, both sides of the equation must be identical, meaning they simplify to the same expression. so, if i can manipulate this equation to see under what condition the left side equals the right side for all 
x
x, that should give me the value of 
a
a.

let me start by expanding both sides of the equation to simplify it.

on the left side: 
3
(
2
x
−
a
)
3(2x−a)

i'll distribute the 3:

3
×
2
x
=
6
x
3×2x=6x

and 
3
×
(
−
a
)
=
−
3
a
3×(−a)=−3a

so, the left side simplifies to 
6
x
−
3
a
6x−3a

on the right side: 
2
(
3
x
+
12
)
2(3x+12)

i'll distribute the 2:

2
×
3
x
=
6
x
2×3x=6x

and 
2
×
12
=
24
2×12=24

so, the right side simplifies to 
6
x
+
24
6x+24

now, the equation looks like this:

6
x
−
3
a
=
6
x
+
24
6x−3a=6x+24

hmm, i see that both sides have a 
6
x
6x term. if i subtract 
6
x
6x from both sides to eliminate it, i get:

−
3
a
=
24
−3a=24

now, to solve for 
a
a, i can divide both sides by -3:

a
=
24
−
3
a= 
−3
24
​	
 

a
=
−
8
a=−8

wait a minute, but the question is asking for the value of 
a
a that makes the equation have infinitely many solutions. i just found 
a
=
−
8
a=−8, but does that mean that when 
a
=
−
8
a=−8, the equation has infinitely many solutions?

let me check that. if 
a
=
−
8
a=−8, then the original equation becomes:

3
(
2
x
−
(
−
8
)
)
=
2
(
3
x
+
12
)
3(2x−(−8))=2(3x+12)

which simplifies to:

3
(
2
x
+
8
)
=
2
(
3
x
+
12
)
3(2x+8)=2(3x+12)

let me expand both sides again:

left side: 
3
×
2
x
=
6
x
3×2x=6x, and 
3
×
8
=
24
3×8=24, so 
6
x
+
24
6x+24

right side: 
2
×
3
x
=
6
x
2×3x=6x, and 
2
×
12
=
24
2×12=24, so 
6
x
+
24
6x+24

so, both sides are 
6
x
+
24
6x+24, which means the equation simplifies to 
6
x
+
24
=
6
x
+
24
6x+24=6x+24, which is always true, no matter what 
x
x is. that means there are infinitely many solutions because any value of 
x
x will satisfy the equation.

but earlier, i thought that for infinitely many solutions, the equations need to be identical. and in this case, when 
a
=
−
8
a=−8, both sides become identical, so that makes sense.

however, i recall that in some cases, if you have equations that are multiples of each other, they can also result in infinitely many solutions, but in this case, both sides are exactly the same when 
a
=
−
8
a=−8, which is a more straightforward scenario.

let me consider if there are any other values of 
a
a that could make this happen. suppose 
a
a is not equal to -8, what happens?

for example, if 
a
=
0
a=0, then the equation becomes:

3
(
2
x
−
0
)
=
2
(
3
x
+
12
)
3(2x−0)=2(3x+12)

which is:

6
x
=
6
x
+
24
6x=6x+24

subtracting 
6
x
6x from both sides:

0
=
24
0=24, which is a contradiction. so, no solution in this case.

if 
a
=
1
a=1, then:

3
(
2
x
−
1
)
=
2
(
3
x
+
12
)
3(2x−1)=2(3x+12)

6
x
−
3
=
6
x
+
24
6x−3=6x+24

subtract 
6
x
6x:

−
3
=
24
−3=24, again a contradiction.

it seems like only when 
a
=
−
8
a=−8 do both sides become identical, leading to infinitely many solutions.

but to be thorough, let's think about what it means for an equation to have infinitely many solutions. essentially, it means that the equation is an identity, true for all 
x
x. for linear equations in one variable, this happens when both sides are the same expression.

in this problem, after simplifying both sides, we ended up with 
6
x
−
3
a
=
6
x
+
24
6x−3a=6x+24. for these two expressions to be identical, their corresponding coefficients must be equal. that is, the coefficient of 
x
x on both sides must be equal, and the constant terms must be equal.

we already saw that the coefficients of 
x
x are both 6, which are equal, so that's good. now, for the constants: 
−
3
a
−3a must equal 24.

solving 
−
3
a
=
24
−3a=24 gives 
a
=
−
8
a=−8, as before.

therefore, 
a
=
−
8
a=−8 is indeed the only value that makes the original equation have infinitely many solutions.

just to recap:

- expand both sides: 
6
x
−
3
a
=
6
x
+
24
6x−3a=6x+24

- subtract 
6
x
6x from both sides: 
−
3
a
=
24
−3a=24

- solve for 
a
a: 
a
=
−
8
a=−8

and verification by plugging 
a
=
−
8
a=−8 back into the original equation confirms that both sides are identical, leading to infinitely many solutions.

i don't think there's any other value of 
a
a that would satisfy this condition, as any other value would lead to a contradiction, meaning no solution or a unique solution, but not infinitely many.

so, the answer should be 
a
=
−
8
a=−8.

**final answer**

−8
