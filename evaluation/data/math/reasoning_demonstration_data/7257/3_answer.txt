Answer: To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 75 and 360, we can use the Euclidean algorithm:

1. **Divide 360 by 75**:
   - 360 รท 75 = 4 with a remainder of 60.

2. **Divide 75 by 60**:
   - 75 รท 60 = 1 with a remainder of 15.

3. **Divide 60 by 15**:
   - 60 รท 15 = 4 with no remainder.

Since there is no remainder, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is **15**.

Thus, the greatest common divisor of 75 and 360 is **15**.
