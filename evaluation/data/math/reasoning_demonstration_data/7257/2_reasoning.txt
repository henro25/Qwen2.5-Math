Reasoning: Okay, I need to find the greatest common divisor of 75 and 360. GCD stands for greatest common divisor, which is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find the largest number that can divide both 75 and 360 evenly.

First, I should probably list out the factors of each number and see which ones they have in common. Let's start with 75. The factors of 75 are the numbers that can be multiplied together to get 75. So, 1 times 75 is 75, 3 times 25 is 75, and 5 times 15 is 75. So, the factors of 75 are 1, 3, 5, 15, 25, and 75.

Now, for 360. That's a bigger number, so there might be more factors. Let's see: 1 times 360 is 360, 2 times 180 is 360, 3 times 120 is 360, 4 times 90 is 360, 5 times 72 is 360, 6 times 60 is 360, 8 times 45 is 360, 9 times 40 is 360, 10 times 36 is 360, 12 times 30 is 360, 15 times 24 is 360, 18 times 20 is 360. So, the factors of 360 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180, and 360.

Now, I need to find the common factors between 75 and 360. Looking at the lists:

Factors of 75: 1, 3, 5, 15, 25, 75

Factors of 360: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180, 360

The common factors are 1, 3, 5, and 15. Among these, the greatest one is 15. So, is 15 the greatest common divisor of 75 and 360?

Wait a minute, I should double-check. Maybe there's a better way to find the GCD without listing all the factors, especially since 360 has a lot of factors.

I recall there's a method called the Euclidean algorithm that can find the GCD more efficiently. I think it involves dividing the larger number by the smaller one and then using the remainder to continue the process.

Let's try that. So, I have 360 and 75. I divide 360 by 75. 75 times 4 is 300, and 360 minus 300 is 60. So, the remainder is 60.

Now, I take the previous divisor, which was 75, and divide it by the remainder, which is 60. So, 75 divided by 60 is 1 with a remainder of 15.

Next, I take the previous remainder, 60, and divide it by the new remainder, 15. 60 divided by 15 is exactly 4 with no remainder.

Since there's no remainder left, the last non-zero remainder is 15. So, the GCD should be 15.

That matches what I found earlier by listing the factors. So, I'm confident that 15 is the greatest common divisor of 75 and 360.
