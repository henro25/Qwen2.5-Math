Problem: Bob is trying to decide between two cell phone plans. Plan A has no flat fee, but the user must pay $10$ cents per minute on the phone. Plan B requires a one-time fee of $\$20$, but only requires a payment of $5$ cents per minute on the phone. What is the minimum whole number of minutes Bob has to use the phone for to make Plan B the cheaper plan?
