Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: if φ and ϕ are the two distinct solutions to the equation x² = x + 1, then what is the value of (φ - ϕ)²?

first off, i need to find the solutions to the equation x² = x + 1. this is a quadratic equation, and i know that quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula. the standard form of a quadratic equation is ax² + bx + c = 0. so, i need to rewrite the given equation in that form.

starting with x² = x + 1, i'll subtract x and 1 from both sides to get:

x² - x - 1 = 0

now, this is in the standard quadratic form, where a = 1, b = -1, and c = -1.

the quadratic formula is x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). plugging in the values:

x = [ -(-1) ± √( (-1)² - 4*1*(-1) ) ] / (2*1)

x = [ 1 ± √(1 + 4) ] / 2

x = [ 1 ± √5 ] / 2

so, the two solutions are:

φ = (1 + √5)/2

ϕ = (1 - √5)/2

now, i need to find (φ - ϕ)².

first, let's find φ - ϕ.

φ - ϕ = [ (1 + √5)/2 ] - [ (1 - √5)/2 ]

= [ (1 + √5) - (1 - √5) ] / 2

= [1 + √5 - 1 + √5] / 2

= [2√5] / 2

= √5

so, φ - ϕ = √5.

now, (φ - ϕ)² = (√5)² = 5.

wait a minute, that seems straightforward. is there another way to approach this without finding the actual roots?

let me think about vieta's formulas, which relate the sum and product of roots to the coefficients of the polynomial.

for a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots is -b/a and the product is c/a.

in this case, sum of roots φ + ϕ = -(-1)/1 = 1

product of roots φ * ϕ = (-1)/1 = -1

i need to find (φ - ϕ)².

i recall that (φ - ϕ)² = (φ + ϕ)² - 4φϕ

let me verify that:

(φ - ϕ)² = φ² - 2φϕ + ϕ²

and (φ + ϕ)² = φ² + 2φϕ + ϕ²

so, (φ + ϕ)² - 4φϕ = φ² + 2φϕ + ϕ² - 4φϕ = φ² - 2φϕ + ϕ² = (φ - ϕ)²

yes, that works.

so, using vieta's formulas:

(φ - ϕ)² = (φ + ϕ)² - 4φϕ = (1)² - 4*(-1) = 1 + 4 = 5

that confirms the earlier result.

alternatively, i could have noticed that φ and ϕ are the roots of the equation x² = x + 1, which is related to the fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio, but i think the straightforward algebraic approach is sufficient here.

just to double-check, let's plug in the values of φ and ϕ that i found earlier:

φ = (1 + √5)/2 ≈ (1 + 2.236)/2 ≈ 1.618

ϕ = (1 - √5)/2 ≈ (1 - 2.236)/2 ≈ -0.618

then, φ - ϕ = 1.618 - (-0.618) = 1.618 + 0.618 = 2.236, which is approximately √5 (since √5 ≈ 2.236).

squaring that, (2.236)² ≈ 5, which matches our previous result.

so, all methods point to the answer being 5.

**final answer**
