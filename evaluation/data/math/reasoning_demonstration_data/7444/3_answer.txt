Answer: Given a sequence of 58 terms, each term has the form \( p + n \), where \( p \) is the product of all prime numbers less than or equal to 61, and \( n \) takes values from 2 to 59. we need to determine the number of primes in this sequence.

first, \( p \) is the product of all primes up to 61:
\[ p = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times \ldots \times 61 \]

each term in the sequence is \( p + n \) for \( n \) ranging from 2 to 59. since \( p \) is divisible by all primes up to 61, including all values of \( n \) (as \( n \) ranges from 2 to 59), \( p + n \) is divisible by \( n \).

for \( p + n \) to be prime, it must be divisible only by 1 and itself. however, since \( p \) is divisible by \( n \), \( p + n \) is also divisible by \( n \), making \( p + n \) composite for all \( n \) in the given range.

therefore, none of the terms \( p + n \) for \( n \) from 2 to 59 can be prime.

thus, the number of primes in this sequence is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]
