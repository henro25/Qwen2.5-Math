Reasoning: So i've got this problem here. it says that there's a sequence of 58 terms, each of the form p + n, where p is the product of all prime numbers less than or equal to 61. so, p = 2 × 3 × 5 × … × 61. and n takes values from 2 to 59, inclusive. then, n is the number of primes in this sequence, and i have to figure out which of the given options n equals: 0, 16, 17, 57, or 58.

first, i need to understand what p is. p is the product of all primes up to 61. that means p is divisible by 2, 3, 5, ..., up to 61. so, p is a multiple of all these primes.

now, each term in the sequence is p + n, where n ranges from 2 to 59. so, p + 2, p + 3, up to p + 59.

i need to find out how many of these terms are prime numbers.

well, let's think about this. for p + n to be prime, it has to be that p + n is only divisible by 1 and itself.

but p is divisible by all the primes up to 61, so p is divisible by 2, 3, 5, etc., up to 61.

now, p + n, for n from 2 to 59. let's see, n is between 2 and 59, and p is divisible by all primes up to 61, which includes all primes up to 59, since 59 is less than 61.

wait, no. 59 is less than 61, so p is divisible by 59 as well.

hold on, p is divisible by all primes up to 61, including 59.

so, p is divisible by 2, 3, 5, ..., 59, and 61.

now, when we add n to p, where n is from 2 to 59, and since p is divisible by n (because n is one of the primes multiplied to get p), p + n should be divisible by n.

wait, is that right?

let me think.

if p is divisible by n, then p + n should also be divisible by n, because p is a multiple of n, and n is obviously a multiple of n.

so, p + n is a multiple of n.

therefore, p + n is divisible by n.

but if n is greater than 1, then p + n is divisible by n, and since p + n is greater than n (because p is a huge number, much larger than n), p + n cannot be prime, because it's divisible by n.

wait, but n ranges from 2 to 59, and p is divisible by each of these n's.

so, p + n is divisible by n, and since n is at least 2, p + n is composite, right?

therefore, none of the terms p + n for n from 2 to 59 should be prime.

but wait, what if n is a prime number itself?

well, even if n is prime, p is divisible by n, so p + n is divisible by n, making p + n composite, unless p + n equals n, but p is much larger than n, so p + n is much larger than n.

therefore, p + n is composite for all n from 2 to 59.

hence, n, the number of primes in this sequence, should be zero.

so, the answer should be 0, which is option a.

wait, but let's double-check.

is there any chance that p + n could be prime?

well, p is divisible by all primes up to 61, and n is from 2 to 59.

since n is at least 2 and at most 59, and p is divisible by n, p + n is divisible by n, meaning p + n is a multiple of n greater than n, hence composite.

therefore, n = 0.

yes, that seems correct.
