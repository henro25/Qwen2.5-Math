Problem: Quadrilateral $ABCD$ is inscribed in a circle with segment $AC$ a diameter of the circle. If $m\angle DAC = 30^\circ$ and $m\angle BAC = 45^\circ$, the ratio of the area of $ABCD$ to the area of the circle can be expressed as a common fraction in simplest radical form in terms of $\pi$ as $\frac{a+\sqrt{b}}{c\pi}$, where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are positive integers. What is the value of $a + b + c$?
