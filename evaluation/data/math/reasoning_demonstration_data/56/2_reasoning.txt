Reasoning: So i have this problem here: i need to evaluate the product 
(
n
−
1
)
⋅
n
⋅
(
n
+
1
)
⋅
(
n
+
2
)
⋅
(
n
+
3
)
(n−1)⋅n⋅(n+1)⋅(n+2)⋅(n+3) where 
n
=
2
n=2. hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but i think i can handle it step by step.

first, i should probably plug in the value of 
n
n into each part of the expression. since 
n
=
2
n=2, i'll substitute that in:

(
2
−
1
)
⋅
2
⋅
(
2
+
1
)
⋅
(
2
+
2
)
⋅
(
2
+
3
)
(2−1)⋅2⋅(2+1)⋅(2+2)⋅(2+3)
now, let's simplify each part inside the parentheses:

(
2
−
1
)
=
1
(2−1)=1
2
=
2
2=2
(
2
+
1
)
=
3
(2+1)=3
(
2
+
2
)
=
4
(2+2)=4
(
2
+
3
)
=
5
(2+3)=5
so now the expression looks like:

1
⋅
2
⋅
3
⋅
4
⋅
5
1⋅2⋅3⋅4⋅5
alright, that's much simpler! now i just need to multiply these numbers together. i can do this step by step.

first, multiply 1 and 2:

1
⋅
2
=
2
1⋅2=2
next, multiply that result by 3:

2
⋅
3
=
6
2⋅3=6
then, multiply that by 4:

6
⋅
4
=
24
6⋅4=24
finally, multiply that by 5:

24
⋅
5
=
120
24⋅5=120
so, the product is 120.

wait a minute, is there a faster way to do this? i know that multiplying a sequence of consecutive numbers can sometimes be related to factorials. let me think about that.

the expression is:

(
n
−
1
)
⋅
n
⋅
(
n
+
1
)
⋅
(
n
+
2
)
⋅
(
n
+
3
)
(n−1)⋅n⋅(n+1)⋅(n+2)⋅(n+3)
with 
n
=
2
n=2, but maybe if i consider it in general, i can find a pattern or a formula that applies.

i recall that the product of consecutive integers can be expressed using factorials. specifically, the product of 
k
k consecutive integers starting from 
m
m is equal to 
(
m
+
k
−
1
)
!
(
m
−
1
)
!
(m−1)!
(m+k−1)!
​
 .

in this case, 
m
=
n
−
1
m=n−1 and 
k
=
5
k=5, since there are five terms: 
n
−
1
,
n
,
n
+
1
,
n
+
2
,
n
+
3
n−1,n,n+1,n+2,n+3.

so, the product can be written as:

(
n
−
1
+
5
−
1
)
!
(
n
−
1
−
1
)
!
=
(
n
+
3
)
!
(
n
−
2
)
!
(n−1−1)!
(n−1+5−1)!
​
 = 
(n−2)!
(n+3)!
​
 
let me check that with 
n
=
2
n=2:

(
2
+
3
)
!
(
2
−
2
)
!
=
5
!
0
!
=
120
1
=
120
(2−2)!
(2+3)!
​
 = 
0!
5!
​
 = 
1
120
​
 =120
okay, that matches the earlier result. so, using the factorial formula also gives me 120.

is there another way to look at this? maybe using the concept of combinations or permutations?

alternatively, i could consider expanding the expression directly, but that might be more complicated for five terms. let's see:

(
n
−
1
)
⋅
n
⋅
(
n
+
1
)
⋅
(
n
+
2
)
⋅
(
n
+
3
)
(n−1)⋅n⋅(n+1)⋅(n+2)⋅(n+3)
expanding step by step:

first, multiply 
n
−
1
n−1 and 
n
n:

(
n
−
1
)
⋅
n
=
n
2
−
n
(n−1)⋅n=n 
2
 −n
next, multiply that by 
n
+
1
n+1:

(
n
2
−
n
)
⋅
(
n
+
1
)
=
n
3
−

n
(n

 −n)⋅(n+1)=n

 −n

 +n

 −n=n

 −n
then, multiply that by 
n
+
2
n+2:

(
n

−
n
)
⋅
(
n
+
2
)
=
n

−

n
(n

 −n)⋅(n+2)=n

finally, multiply that by 
n
+

n+3:

(

now, plug in

calculate each term:

12
=
120
32+80+40−20−12=120
again, i get 120. it seems consistent across different methods.

maybe i can also think about this in terms of polynomial multiplication or using the properties of sequences, but i think i've already covered the main approaches.

alternatively, since these are five consecutive integers, their product is related to the concept of a sequence of consecutive numbers, which often appears in combinatorics and number theory.

but for this specific problem, since 
n
=
2
n=2 is given, plugging in the value directly seems the most straightforward approach.

just to be thorough, i'll verify using another method. let's consider the sequence:

(
n
−
1
)
,
n
,
(
n
+
1
)
,
(
n
+
2
)
,
(
n
+
3
)
(n−1),n,(n+1),(n+2),(n+3)
for 
n
=
2
n=2, that's:

1
,
2
,
3
,
4
,
5
1,2,3,4,5
the product is 
1
×
2
×
3
×
4
×
5
=
120
1×2×3×4×5=120, which matches all previous calculations.

i think it's safe to conclude that the product is indeed 120.

**final answer**

120
120
