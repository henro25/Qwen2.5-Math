Problem: Consider the triangular array of numbers with 0, 1, 2, 3, $\dots$ along the sides and interior numbers obtained by adding the two adjacent numbers in the previous row.  Rows 1 through 6 are shown.

\[
\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
& & & & & 0 & & & & & \\
& & & & 1 & & 1 & & & & \\
& & & 2 & & 2 & & 2 & & & \\
& & 3 & & 4 & & 4 & & 3 & & \\
& 4 & & 7 & & 8 & & 7 & & 4 & \\
5 & & 11 & & 15 & & 15 & & 11 & & 5
\end{array}
\]Find the sum of the numbers in the 100th row.  Your answer should use exponential notation, in simplest form.
