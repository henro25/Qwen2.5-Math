Answer: To find the area enclosed by the graph of \( |3x| + |4y| = 12 \), we first rewrite the equation in a more familiar form:

\[
\frac{|3x|}{12} + \frac{|4y|}{12} = 1 \implies \frac{|x|}{4} + \frac{|y|}{3} = 1
\]

this is the standard form of a diamond-shaped graph, where \( a = 4 \) and \( b = 3 \). the vertices of the diamond are at \( (4,0) \), \( (-4,0) \), \( (0,3) \), and \( (0,-3) \).

the area of a diamond (or rhombus) with diagonals of lengths \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) is given by:

\[
\text{area} = \frac{d_1 \cdot d_2}{2}
\]

here, the horizontal diagonal is from \( (-4,0) \) to \( (4,0) \), so its length is \( 8 \) units. the vertical diagonal is from \( (0,-3) \) to \( (0,3) \), so its length is \( 6 \) units.

thus, the area is:

\[
\text{area} = \frac{8 \cdot 6}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
\]

therefore, the area enclosed by the graph of \( |3x| + |4y| = 12 \) is:

\[
\boxed{24}
\]
