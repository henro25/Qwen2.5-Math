Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: find the area enclosed by the graph of |3x| + |4y| = 12. hmm, absolute values in the equation usually mean that the graph isn't just a straight line; it probably has some symmetry to it. i think i need to understand what this graph looks like first before i can find its area.

okay, so absolute value equations can be a bit tricky, but i remember that |a| + |b| = c kind of shapes usually form diamonds or rectangles, depending on the coefficients. in this case, it's |3x| + |4y| = 12. maybe i should try to rewrite this equation to make it look more familiar.

let me see, if i divide both sides by 12, i get |3x|/12 + |4y|/12 = 1, which simplifies to |x|/4 + |y|/3 = 1. that looks a lot like the standard form of a diamond-shaped graph, which is |x/a| + |y/b| = 1, where a and b are the intercepts on the x and y axes, respectively.

so, in this case, a is 4 and b is 3. that means the graph intersects the x-axis at x = 4 and x = -4, and the y-axis at y = 3 and y = -3. if i plot these points, i can sketch the graph.

let me plot these points:

- when y = 0, |3x| = 12 ⇒ x = ±4

- when x = 0, |4y| = 12 ⇒ y = ±3

connecting these points, i think the graph is a diamond with vertices at (4,0), (-4,0), (0,3), and (0,-3).

to find the area of this diamond, i recall that for a diamond shape with diagonals of lengths d1 and d2, the area is (d1 * d2)/2.

here, the horizontal diagonal is from (-4,0) to (4,0), so its length is 8 units. the vertical diagonal is from (0,-3) to (0,3), so its length is 6 units.

so, area = (8 * 6)/2 = 48/2 = 24.

wait a minute, is that correct? let me double-check.

alternatively, since it's a diamond, it's also a square rotated by 45 degrees, but with different side lengths. actually, no, in this case, it's not a square because the intercepts are different.

let me try another approach. maybe i can find the area by dividing the diamond into triangles.

from (0,0) to (4,0) to (0,3) and back to (0,0), that's one triangle. similarly, there are four such triangles in the diamond.

so, the area of one triangle is (base * height)/2 = (4 * 3)/2 = 6. since there are four such triangles, total area is 4 * 6 = 24.

okay, that matches my previous answer. so, the area should be 24.

but just to be thorough, maybe i should consider solving for y in terms of x and integrating to find the area.

starting with |3x| + |4y| = 12.

let me solve for y:

|4y| = 12 - |3x|

4|y| = 12 - |3x|

|y| = (12 - |3x|)/4

y = ±(12 - |3x|)/4

this gives me the upper and lower boundaries of y in terms of x.

to find the area, i can integrate the difference between the upper and lower y bounds from x = -4 to x = 4.

so, area = ∫ from x = -4 to x = 4 of [ (12 - |3x|)/4 - ( - (12 - |3x|)/4 ) ] dx

= ∫ from -4 to 4 of [ (12 - |3x|)/4 + (12 - |3x|)/4 ] dx

= ∫ from -4 to 4 of [ 2*(12 - |3x|)/4 ] dx

= ∫ from -4 to 4 of [ (12 - |3x|)/2 ] dx

this seems a bit complicated. maybe i can simplify it by considering symmetry.

since the function is even in x, i can integrate from 0 to 4 and multiply by 2.

so, area = 2 * ∫ from 0 to 4 of (12 - 3x)/2 dx, because for x >= 0, |3x| = 3x.

wait, but |3x| = 3x when x >= 0, and |3x| = -3x when x < 0, but since i'm considering x from 0 to 4, i can use |3x| = 3x.

so, area = 2 * ∫ from 0 to 4 of (12 - 3x)/2 dx

= 2 * [ ∫ from 0 to 4 of 12/2 dx - ∫ from 0 to 4 of (3x)/2 dx ]

= 2 * [ ∫ from 0 to 4 of 6 dx - ∫ from 0 to 4 of (3x)/2 dx ]

= 2 * [ 6x from 0 to 4 - (3/4)x^2 from 0 to 4 ]

= 2 * [ (6*4 - 0) - (3/4 * 16 - 0) ]

= 2 * [ 24 - 12 ]

= 2 * 12

= 24

again, i get 24. so, that confirms my earlier result.

i think 24 is the correct area enclosed by the graph of |3x| + |4y| = 12.

**final answer**
