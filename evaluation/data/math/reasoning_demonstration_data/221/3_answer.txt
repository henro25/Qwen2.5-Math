Answer: To solve the equation \( 2x + 4 = |{-17 + 3}| \), follow these steps:

1. **Simplify the absolute value:**
   \[
   -17 + 3 = -14
   \]
   The absolute value of \(-14\) is \(14\), so the equation becomes:
   \[
   2x + 4 = 14
   \]

2. **Isolate the term with \( x \):**
   Subtract 4 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 14 - 4
   \]
   \[
   2x = 10
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = \frac{10}{2} = 5
   \]

**Answer:** \( x = 5 \)
