Reasoning: So i have this problem here about a basketball game. shenille only attempted three-point shots and two-point shots. she made 20% of her three-point attempts and 30% of her two-point attempts. she attempted a total of 30 shots. i need to find out how many points she scored in total.

first, i should probably define some variables to represent the unknowns here. let's say:

let 
x
x be the number of three-point shots she attempted.

and 
y
y be the number of two-point shots she attempted.

i know that she attempted a total of 30 shots, so:

x
+
y
=
30
x+y=30

that's one equation. now, i need another equation to relate these variables.

i know that she was successful on 20% of her three-point shots and 30% of her two-point shots.

so, the number of successful three-point shots is 20% of 
x
x, which is 
0.2
x
0.2x.

similarly, the number of successful two-point shots is 30% of 
y
y, which is 
0.3
y
0.3y.

each successful three-point shot is worth 3 points, and each successful two-point shot is worth 2 points.

so, her total points scored would be:

3
×
0.2
x
+
2
×
0.3
y
3×0.2x+2×0.3y

that simplifies to:

0.6
x
+
0.6
y
0.6x+0.6y

wait, both terms have 0.6, so maybe i can factor that:

0.6
(
x
+
y
)
0.6(x+y)

but i already know that 
x
+
y
=
30
x+y=30, so plugging that in:

0.6
×
30
=
18
0.6×30=18

so, she scored 18 points in total.

wait, that seems straightforward, but i'm wondering if i missed something. let me check the logic again.

she attempted 
x
x three-pointers and 
y
y two-pointers, with 
x
+
y
=
30
x+y=30.

made 20% of three-pointers: 
0.2
x
0.2x successful, each worth 3 points: 
3
×
0.2
x
=
0.6
x
3×0.2x=0.6x

made 30% of two-pointers: 
0.3
y
0.3y successful, each worth 2 points: 
2
×
0.3
y
=
0.6
y
2×0.3y=0.6y

total points: 
0.6
x
+
0.6
y
=
0.6
(
x
+
y
)
=
0.6
×
30
=
18
0.6x+0.6y=0.6(x+y)=0.6×30=18

seems correct. maybe i can try another approach to confirm.

alternative approach: let's find the number of successful shots.

number of successful three-pointers: 
0.2
x
0.2x

number of successful two-pointers: 
0.3
y
0.3y

total points: 
3
(
0.2
x
)
+
2
(
0.3
y
)
=
0.6
x
+
0.6
y
=
0.6
(
x
+
y
)
=
0.6
×
30
=
18
3(0.2x)+2(0.3y)=0.6x+0.6y=0.6(x+y)=0.6×30=18

same result.

wait, is there a possibility that the percentages could lead to fractional successful shots? for example, if she attempted 10 three-pointers, 20% would be 2 successful shots.

similarly, if she attempted 20 two-pointers, 30% would be 6 successful shots.

total points: 
3
×
2
+
2
×
6
=
6
+
12
=
18
3×2+2×6=6+12=18

again, 18 points.

alternatively, if she attempted 5 three-pointers, 20% is 1 successful shot.

and 25 two-pointers, 30% is 7.5 successful shots, which doesn't make sense because you can't have half a successful shot.

hmm, maybe the number of attempted shots must be such that successful shots are whole numbers.

wait, but in the problem, it's possible that the numbers work out to fractions, but in reality, you can't have half a shot. so perhaps there's a constraint that the number of attempted shots must be such that the successful shots are integers.

but in my earlier calculation, assuming 
x
+
y
=
30
x+y=30, and total points as 
0.6
×
30
=
18
0.6×30=18, it seems consistent.

alternatively, perhaps there's another way to look at it.

let me think in terms of expected value or average.

each three-point attempt, on average, gives 
0.2
×
3
=
0.6
0.2×3=0.6 points.

each two-point attempt, on average, gives 
0.3
×
2
=
0.6
0.3×2=0.6 points.

so, regardless of how many of each type she attempted, as long as the total attempts are 30, the total points should be 
30
×
0.6
=
18
30×0.6=18 points.

this seems to confirm the earlier result.

but just to be thorough, let's suppose she attempted 
x
x three-pointers and 
y
=
30
−
x
y=30−x two-pointers.

then, points from three-pointers: 
3
×
0.2
x
=
0.6
x
3×0.2x=0.6x

points from two-pointers: 
2
×
0.3
(
30
−
x
)
=
0.6
(
30
−
x
)
2×0.3(30−x)=0.6(30−x)

total points: 
0.6
x
+
0.6
(
30
−
x
)
=
0.6
x
+
18
−
0.6
x
=
18
0.6x+0.6(30−x)=0.6x+18−0.6x=18

again, 18 points.

i think this is solid. all approaches lead to the same answer.

so, the answer should be 
18
18
​
 .

**final answer**

18
18
