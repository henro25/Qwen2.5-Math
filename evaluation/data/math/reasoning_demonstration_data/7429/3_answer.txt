Answer: Given a water tank in the shape of an inverted right circular cone with a base radius of 16 feet and a height of 96 feet, we need to find the height of the water when the tank is 25% full. the height of the water is to be expressed in the form \( a\sqrt[3]{b} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers, and \( b \) is not divisible by a perfect cube greater than 1. finally, we need to find \( a + b \).

1. **volume of the tank:**
   \[
   v_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi (16)^2 (96) = \frac{1}{3} \pi (256) (96) = 8192 \pi
   \]

2. **volume of the water:**
   \[
   v_{\text{water}} = 0.25 \times v_{\text{total}} = 0.25 \times 8192 \pi = 2048 \pi
   \]

3. **volume of the water cone:**
   \[
   v_{\text{water}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h = \frac{1}{3} \pi \left( \frac{h}{6} \right)^2 h = \frac{\pi h^3}{108}
   \]

4. **equating the volumes:**
   \[
   \frac{\pi h^3}{108} = 2048 \pi \implies \frac{h^3}{108} = 2048 \implies h^3 = 2048 \times 108 = 221184
   \]

5. **solving for \( h \):**
   \[
   h = \sqrt[3]{221184}
   \]

6. **prime factorization of 221184:**
   \[
   221184 = 2^{12} \times 3^3
   \]

7. **simplifying the cube root:**
   \[
   h = \sqrt[3]{2^{12} \times 3^3} = 2^4 \times 3 = 16 \times 3 = 48
   \]

8. **correcting the cube root calculation:**
   \[
   h = 48 \sqrt[3]{2}
   \]

thus, \( a = 48 \) and \( b = 2 \), so \( a + b = 48 + 2 = 50 \).

\[
\boxed{50}
\]
