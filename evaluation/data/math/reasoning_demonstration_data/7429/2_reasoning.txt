Reasoning: 
Let's see what we've got here. there's this water tank that's shaped like an inverted right circular cone. so, it's like a cone pointing downwards with its tip at the bottom and the base at the top. the base has a radius of 16 feet, and the height of the cone is 96 feet. now, the water in the tank is 25% of the tank's total capacity, and we need to find the height of the water level in the form 
a
b
3
a 
3
  
b
​	
 , where 
a
a and 
b
b are positive integers, and 
b
b isn't divisible by any perfect cube greater than 1. finally, we need to find 
a
+
b
a+b.

first things first, i need to understand the relationship between the volume of a cone and the height of the water in it. since the tank is an inverted cone, as water is added, it forms a smaller cone with the same shape but a different height.

let me recall the formula for the volume of a cone: 
v
=
1
3
π
r
2
h
v= 
3
1
​	
 πr 
2
 h, where 
r
r is the radius of the base and 
h
h is the height.

in this case, the entire tank has a radius of 16 feet and a height of 96 feet. so, the total volume of the tank is 
v
total
=
1
3
π
(
16
)
2
(
96
)
v 
total
​	
 = 
3
1
​	
 π(16) 
2
 (96).

now, the water forms a smaller cone inside the tank. let's denote the height of the water as 
h
h, and the radius of the water's surface as 
r
r. since the two cones are similar (the water cone and the tank), their dimensions are proportional. that means 
r
h
=
16
96
h
r
​	
 = 
96
16
​	
 , which simplifies to 
r
h
=
1
6
h
r
​	
 = 
6
1
​	
 , so 
r
=
h
6
r= 
6
h
​	
 .

the volume of the water is then 
v
water
=
1
3
π

2
h
=

π
(
h

​	
 .

we're told that the water is 25% of the tank's capacity, so 
v
water
=
0.25
v
total
v 
water
​	
 =0.25v 
total
​	
 .

let's set up the equation:

π
h
3
108
=
0.25
×
1
3
π
(
16
)
2
(
96
)
108
πh 
3
 
​	
 =0.25× 
3
1
​	
 π(16) 
2
 (96).

i can cancel out 
π
π from both sides:

h
3
108
=
0.25
×
1
3
(
256
)
(
96
)
108
h 
3
 
​	
 =0.25× 
3
1
​	
 (256)(96).

simplify the right side:

first, calculate 
256
×
96
256×96:

256
×
96
=
256
×
(
100
−
4
)
=
25600
−
1024
=
24576
256×96=256×(100−4)=25600−1024=24576.

then, 
1
3
×
24576
=
8192
3
1
​	
 ×24576=8192.

now, 
0.25
×
8192
=
2048
0.25×8192=2048.

so, the equation is:

h
3
108
=
2048
108
h 
3
 
​	
 =2048.

now, solve for 
h
3
h 
3
 :

h
3
=
2048
×
108
h 
3
 =2048×108.

let's calculate that:

first, 2048 times 100 is 204800.

then, 2048 times 8 is 16384.

so, 204800 + 16384 = 221184.

thus, 
h
3
=
221184
h 
3
 =221184.

now, to find 
h
h, we take the cube root of both sides:

h
=
221184
3
h= 
3
  
221184
​	
 .

hmm, i need to simplify 
221184
3
3
  
221184
​	
 . let's factor 221184 to see if we can simplify it.

first, let's factor 221184.

we can start by dividing by 2 repeatedly:

221184 ÷ 2 = 110592

110592 ÷ 2 = 55296

55296 ÷ 2 = 27648

27648 ÷ 2 = 13824

13824 ÷ 2 = 6912

6912 ÷ 2 = 3456

3456 ÷ 2 = 1728

1728 ÷ 2 = 864

864 ÷ 2 = 432

432 ÷ 2 = 216

216 ÷ 2 = 108

108 ÷ 2 = 54

54 ÷ 2 = 27

27 ÷ 3 = 9

9 ÷ 3 = 3

3 ÷ 3 = 1

so, the prime factors are 
2
12
×
3
3
2 
12
 ×3 
3
 .

therefore, 
221184
=
2
12
×
3
3
221184=2 
12
 ×3 
3
 .

now, the cube root of that is 
2
12
×
3
3
3
=
2
4
×
3
=
16
×
3
=
48
3
  
2 
12
 ×3 
3
 
​	
 =2 
4
 ×3=16×3=48.

wait a minute, that can't be right because the height of the water can't be equal to the height of the tank if it's only 25% full.

i must have made a mistake somewhere.

let me check my calculations again.

starting from 
h
3
=
221184
h 
3
 =221184, and factoring 221184:

221184 divided by 2 is 110592

110592 ÷ 2 = 55296

55296 ÷ 2 = 27648

27648 ÷ 2 = 13824

13824 ÷ 2 = 6912

6912 ÷ 2 = 3456

3456 ÷ 2 = 1728

1728 ÷ 2 = 864

864 ÷ 2 = 432

432 ÷ 2 = 216

216 ÷ 2 = 108

108 ÷ 2 = 54

54 ÷ 2 = 27

27 ÷ 3 = 9

9 ÷ 3 = 3

3 ÷ 3 = 1

so, yes, 221184 = 
2
12
×
3
3
2 
12
 ×3 
3
 .

thus, 
h
=
2
12
×
3
3
3
=
2
4
×
3
=
16
×
3
=
48
h= 
3
  
2 
12
 ×3 
3
 
​	
 =2 
4
 ×3=16×3=48.

but as i thought earlier, if the height of the water is 48 feet, which is half the height of the tank, but we're told it's 25% of the tank's capacity, which should be less than half. so, there must be an error in my approach.

wait, maybe i messed up the proportion between the volumes.

let me revisit the relationship between the volumes.

the volume of a cone is 
v
=
1
3
π
r
2
h
v= 
3
1
​	
 πr 
2
 h, and since the cones are similar, the ratios of corresponding dimensions are equal.

given that 
r
r
=
h
h
r
r
​	
 = 
h
h
​	
 , where 
r
=
16
r=16 and 
h
=
96
h=96, so 
r
h
=
16
96
=
1
6
h
r
​	
 = 
96
16
​	
 = 
6
1
​	
 , hence 
r
=
h
6
r= 
6
h
​	
 .

then, the volume of the water is 
v
water
=
1
3
π
(
h
6
)
2
h
=
1
3
π
h
2
36
h
=
π
h
3
108
v 
water
​	
 = 
3
1
​	
 π( 
6
h
​	
 ) 
2
 h= 
3
1
​	
 π 
36
h 
2
 
​	
 h= 
108
πh 
3
 
​	
 .

the total volume of the tank is 
v
total
=
1
3
π
(
16
)
2
(
96
)
=
1
3
π
(
256
)
(
96
)
=
1
3
π
(
24576
)
=
8192
π
v 
total
​	
 = 
3
1
​	
 π(16) 
2
 (96)= 
3
1
​	
 π(256)(96)= 
3
1
​	
 π(24576)=8192π.

so, setting 
v
water
=
0.25
v
total
v 
water
​	
 =0.25v 
total
​	
 :

π
h
3
108
=
0.25
×
8192
π
108
πh 
3
 
​	
 =0.25×8192π.

cancel 
π
π:

h
3
108
=
2048
108
h 
3
 
​	
 =2048.

thus, 
h
3
=
2048
×
108
=
221184
h 
3
 =2048×108=221184.

and 
h
=
221184
3
h= 
3
  
221184
​	
 .

wait a minute, perhaps i miscalculated the cube root.

let me compute 
4
8
3
48 
3
 :

4
8
3
=
48
×
48
×
48
48 
3
 =48×48×48.

first, 48 × 48 = 2304.

then, 2304 × 48.

let's compute 2304 × 40 = 92160, and 2304 × 8 = 18432.

adding them up: 92160 + 18432 = 110592.

so, 
4
8
3
=
110592
48 
3
 =110592, but we have 
h
3
=
221184
h 
3
 =221184, which is exactly double of 110592.

wait, that can't be. if 
4
8
3
=
110592
48 
3
 =110592, then 
221184
3
=
2
×
110592
3
=
2
3
×
48
3
  
221184
​	
 = 
3
  
2×110592
​	
 = 
3
  
2
​	
 ×48.

so, 
h
=
48
2
3
h=48 
3
  
2
​	
 .

but earlier, i thought 
h
=
48
h=48, which was incorrect. so, the correct expression is 
h
=
48
2
3
h=48 
3
  
2
​	
 .

but the problem says the height can be written in the form 
a
b
3
a 
3
  
b
​	
 , with 
b
b not divisible by any perfect cube greater than 1.

in this case, 
a
=
48
a=48, 
b
=
2
b=2, and 2 is not divisible by any perfect cube greater than 1, since its prime factorization is just 2.

so, 
a
+
b
=
48
+
2
=
50
a+b=48+2=50.

but wait, according to the calculations, 
h
=
48
2
3
h=48 
3
  
2
​	
 , but according to the earlier step, 
h

h

  is straightforward.

wait, but 
2

4
8
3
=
110592
48 
3
 =110592, which is half of 221184.

i must have messed up the factorization.

let's double-check the factorization of 221184.

221184 ÷ 2 = 110592

110592 ÷ 2 = 55296

55296 ÷ 2 = 27648

27648 ÷ 2 = 13824

13824 ÷ 2 = 6912

6912 ÷ 2 = 3456

3456 ÷ 2 = 1728

1728 ÷ 2 = 864

864 ÷ 2 = 432

432 ÷ 2 = 216

216 ÷ 2 = 108

108 ÷ 2 = 54

54 ÷ 2 = 27

27 ÷ 3 = 9

9 ÷ 3 = 3

3 ÷ 3 = 1

so, 221184 = 
2
12
×
3
3
2 
12
 ×3 
3
 .

then, 
h
=

3

=

3

h=

2 
12
 ×3

​	
 =2 
4
 ×3=16×3=48.

but earlier, i saw that 
4
8
3
=
110592
48 
3
 =110592, which is half of 221184. that doesn't make sense. maybe there's a mistake in calculating 
4
8
3
48 
3
 .

let me calculate 
4
8
3
48 
3
  again.

4
8
2
=
2304
48 
2
 =2304

then, 
2304
×
48
2304×48:

2304 × 40 = 92160

2304 × 8 = 18432

total = 92160 + 18432 = 110592

so, 
4
8
3
=
110592
48 
3
 =110592, but 
h
3
=
221184
h 
3
 =221184, which is double that. so, 
h
3
=
2
×
4
8
3
h

 =2×48 
3
 , meaning 
h
=
48
×
2
3
h=48× 
3
  
2
​	
 .

wait, but according to the cube root of 
2
12
×
3
3
2 
12
 ×3 
3
 , it's 48, but according to the calculation, it should be 48 times cube root of 2.

there's a discrepancy here. let's see:

if 
h

=
221184
=
2
12
×
3
3
h

h

4

=
110592
48 
3
 =110592, which is not equal to 221184.

wait, perhaps the prime factorization is incorrect.

let me try factoring 221184 again.

221184 ÷ 2 = 110592

110592 ÷ 2 = 55296

55296 ÷ 2 = 27648

27648 ÷ 2 = 13824

13824 ÷ 2 = 6912

6912 ÷ 2 = 3456

3456 ÷ 2 = 1728

1728 ÷ 2 = 864

864 ÷ 2 = 432

432 ÷ 2 = 216

216 ÷ 2 = 108

108 ÷ 2 = 54

54 ÷ 2 = 27

27 ÷ 3 = 9

9 ÷ 3 = 3

3 ÷ 3 = 1

so, yes, 221184 = 
2
12
×
3
3
2 
12
 ×3 
3
 .

then, 
h
=

h=

2 
12
 ×3

​	
 =2 
4
 ×3=16×3=48.

but that contradicts the calculation that 
4
8
3
=
110592
48 
3
 =110592, which is half of 221184.

wait, perhaps i misapplied the similarity ratio.

let me double-check the relationship between the volumes.

the volume of the water cone is proportional to the cube of its height compared to the full cone.

so, 
v
water
v
total
=
(
h
h
)
3
v 
total
​	
 
v 
water
​	
 
​	
 =( 
h

​	
 ) 
3
 .

given that 
v
water
=
0.25
v
total
v 
water
​	
 =0.25v 
total
​	
 , then 
(
h
96
)
3
=
0.25
( 
96
h
​	
 ) 
3
 =0.25.

so, 
h
96
=
0.25
3
96
h
​	
 = 
3
  
0.25
​	
 , hence 
h
=
96
0.25
3
h=96 
3
  
0.25
​	
 .

but 
0.25
=

4
=
1
2
2
0.25= 
4
1
​	
 = 
2

​	
 , so 
1
2

​	
 
​

​	
 =2 
−2/3
 .

therefore, 
h
=
96
×
2
−
2
/
3
h=96×2 
−2/3
 .

but this seems messy. maybe there's a better way.

alternatively, since 
v

 , and 
v

v∝h

 , then

h=h×(

so,

h=96×(

this seems consistent, but i need to express it in terms of 
a

 .

let me try expressing 
h
=
96

(

=

h=96×(

​	
 ) 
1/3
 =96×

2/3

​	
 =96×2 
−2/3
 .

to rationalize this, perhaps multiply numerator and denominator by 
2

/

1/3
 :

h
=

​	
 .

so, 
h
=

h=48

​	
 , which matches what i had earlier.

therefore, 
a
=
48
a=48, 
b
=
2
b=2, and 
a
+
b
=
50
a+b=50.

i think that's the answer.

**final answer**

50
