Reasoning: Alright, I've got this problem here: simplify (r² + 3r - 2) - (r² + 7r - 5). Okay, so I need to subtract one polynomial from another. Let's see, I remember that when you subtract polynomials, you have to distribute the negative sign to each term in the second polynomial. So, that means I need to take each term in the second parentheses and change its sign.

So, starting with the first part, (r² + 3r - 2), that stays the same because there's no negative sign in front of it. Now, for the second part, (r² + 7r - 5), I need to distribute the negative sign. That means:

- r² becomes -r²

- +7r becomes -7r

- -5 becomes +5

So, after distributing the negative sign, the expression becomes:

r² + 3r - 2 - r² - 7r + 5

Now, I need to combine like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power. So, let's look at the r² terms:

r² - r² = 0

Okay, so those cancel each other out.

Next, the r terms:

3r - 7r = -4r

And then the constant terms:

-2 + 5 = 3

So, putting it all together, the simplified expression is:

-4r + 3

Wait a second, let me double-check that. Sometimes I make mistakes with the signs.

Starting over:

(r² + 3r - 2) - (r² + 7r - 5) = r² + 3r - 2 - r² - 7r + 5

Combine like terms:

r² - r² = 0

3r - 7r = -4r

-2 + 5 = 3

Yeah, that seems right. So, the final simplified expression is -4r + 3.

I think that's it. I don't see any other like terms to combine or any other operations to perform. It looks straightforward.

Just to be extra sure, maybe I can plug in a value for r and see if both the original expression and the simplified expression give the same result.

Let's choose r = 1.

Original expression: (1² + 3*1 - 2) - (1² + 7*1 - 5) = (1 + 3 - 2) - (1 + 7 - 5) = (4 - 2) - (8 - 5) = 2 - 3 = -1

Simplified expression: -4*1 + 3 = -4 + 3 = -1

Okay, they match for r = 1.

Let's try r = 2.

Original: (4 + 6 - 2) - (4 + 14 - 5) = (10 - 2) - (18 - 5) = 8 - 13 = -5

Simplified: -8 + 3 = -5

Again, they match.

One more, r = 0.

Original: (0 + 0 - 2) - (0 + 0 - 5) = (-2) - (-5) = -2 + 5 = 3

Simplified: 0 + 3 = 3

Perfect, they match again.

I'm confident now that the simplified expression is correct.
