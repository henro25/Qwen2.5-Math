Problem: Wanda is trying to locate the Fermat point $P$ of $\triangle ABC$, where $A$ is at the origin, $B$ is at $(10,0)$, and $C$ is at $(3,5)$ (the Fermat point is the point such that the sum of its distances from the vertices of a triangle is minimized). She guesses that the point is at $P = (4,2)$, and computes the sum of the distances from $P$ to the vertices of $\triangle ABC$. If she obtains $m\sqrt5 + n\sqrt{10}$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers, what is $m + n$?
