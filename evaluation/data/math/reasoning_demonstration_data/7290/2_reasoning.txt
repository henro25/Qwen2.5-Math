Reasoning: I've got this problem here about graphs of equations forming equilateral triangles. let me see if i can wrap my head around it.

so, we have three families of lines:

1. horizontal lines: 
y
=
k
y=k, where 
k
k ranges from -10 to 10 in steps of 1. that's 21 lines because there are 21 integers from -10 to 10 inclusive.

2. lines with positive slope: 
y
=
3
x
+
2
k
y= 
3
​	
 x+2k, again for 
k
=
−
10
k=−10 to 
10
10. that's another 21 lines.

3. lines with negative slope: 
y
=
−
3
x
+
2
k
y=− 
3
​	
 x+2k, same range for 
k
k. another 21 lines.

total of 63 lines.

these lines are supposed to cut the plane into equilateral triangles with side length 
2
/
3
2/ 
3
​	
 . i need to find out how many such triangles are formed.

first, i should probably understand the arrangement of these lines and how they intersect to form these triangles.

let's consider the horizontal lines: 
y
=
k
y=k. these are parallel to each other, spaced 1 unit apart since 
k
k increases by 1 each time.

next, the lines 
y
=
3
x
+
2
k
y= 
3
​	
 x+2k have a slope of 
3
3
​	
 , which corresponds to a 60-degree angle with the x-axis because 
tan
⁡
(
6
0
∘
)
=
3
tan(60 
∘
 )= 
3
​	
 .

similarly, the lines 
y
=
−
3
x
+
2
k
y=− 
3
​	
 x+2k have a slope of 
−
3
− 
3
​	
 , corresponding to a -60-degree angle with the x-axis.

so, these three sets of lines are at 60-degree angles to each other, which makes sense for forming equilateral triangles.

now, the side length of each equilateral triangle is given as 
2
/
3
2/ 
3
​	
 . i need to see how these lines intersect to create such triangles.

let me try to find the points of intersection between these lines.

first, find where a horizontal line intersects a line with positive slope:

set 
k
=
3
x
+
2
k
′
k= 
3
​	
 x+2k 
′
 .

then, 
3
x
=
k
−
2
k
′
3
​	
 x=k−2k 
′
 , so 
x
=
(
k
−
2
k
′
)
/
3
x=(k−2k 
′
 )/ 
3
​	
 .

similarly, find where a horizontal line intersects a line with negative slope:

set 
k
=
−
3
x
+
2
k
′
′
k=− 
3
​	
 x+2k 
′′
 .

then, 
−
3
x
=
k
−
2
k
′
′
− 
3
​	
 x=k−2k 
′′
 , so 
x
=
(
2
k
′
′
−
k
)
/
3
x=(2k 
′′
 −k)/ 
3
​	
 .

also, find where a line with positive slope intersects a line with negative slope:

set 
3
x
+
2
k
′
=
−
3
x
+
2
k
′
′
3
​	
 x+2k 
′
 =− 
3
​	
 x+2k 
′′
 .

then, 
2
3
x
=
2
k
′
′
−
2
k
′
2 
3
​	
 x=2k 
′′
 −2k 
′
 , so 
x
=
(
k
′
′
−
k
′
)
/
3
x=(k 
′′
 −k 
′
 )/ 
3
​	
 .

and then 
y
=
3
x
+
2
k
′
=
3
⋅
k
′
′
−
k
′
3
+
2
k
′
=
(
k
′
′
−
k
′
)
+
2
k
′
=
k
′
′
+
k
′
y= 
3
​	
 x+2k 
′
 = 
3
​	
 ⋅ 
3
​	
 
k 
′′
 −k 
′
 
​	
 +2k 
′
 =(k 
′′
 −k 
′
 )+2k 
′
 =k 
′′
 +k 
′
 .

so, the intersection point is 
(
k
′
′
−
k
′
3
,
k
′
′
+
k
′
)
( 
3
​	
 
k 
′′
 −k 
′
 
​	
 ,k 
′′
 +k 
′
 ).

wait, that seems a bit messy. maybe there's a better way to think about this.

let me consider that these lines form a grid of equilateral triangles. since the lines are at 60-degree angles to each other, the intersections should create a lattice of points where these triangles meet.

given that the side length of each triangle is 
2
/
3
2/ 
3
​	
 , i need to figure out the density of these lines and how they partition the plane.

maybe i can look at the distance between parallel lines.

for the horizontal lines 
y
=
k
y=k, the vertical distance between them is 1 unit.

for the lines 
y
=
3
x
+
2
k
y= 
3
​	
 x+2k, since they have a slope of 
3
3
​	
 , the horizontal distance between parallel lines would be different.

wait, actually, for lines with the same slope, the distance between them can be calculated using the formula for the distance between two parallel lines.

the general formula for the distance between two parallel lines 
a
x
+
b
y
+
c
1
=
0
ax+by+c 
1
​	
 =0 and 
a
x
+
b
y
+
c
2
=
0
ax+by+c 
2
​	
 =0 is 
∣
c
2
−
c

∣
a
2
+
b
2
a 
2
 +b 
2
 
​	
 
∣c 
2
​	
 −c 
1
​	
 ∣
​	
 .

so, for the lines 
y
=
3
x
+
2
k
y= 
3
​	
 x+2k, which can be rewritten as 
−
3
x
+
y
−
2
k
=
0
− 
3
​	
 x+y−2k=0, the distance between two such lines with different 
k
k would be 
∣
2
(
k
2
−
k

)
∣
(
3
)
2
+
1
2
=

∣
k
2
−
k

∣
2
=
∣
k

−
k

∣
( 
3
​	
 ) 
2
 +1 
2
 
​	
 
∣2(k

​	
 −k

​	
 )∣
​	
 = 
2
2∣k 
2
​	
 −k 
1
​	
 ∣
​	
 =∣k 
2
​	
 −k 
1
​	
 ∣.

similarly, for the lines 
y
=
−
3
x
+
2
k
y=− 
3
​	
 x+2k, the distance between two such lines is also 
∣
k
2
−
k
1
∣
∣k 
2
​	
 −k 
1
​	
 ∣.

and for the horizontal lines 
y
=
k
y=k, the distance between two such lines is 
∣
k
2
−
k
1
∣
∣k 
2
​	
 −k 
1
​	
 ∣.

so, all these families of lines are spaced 1 unit apart from each other.

now, since these lines are intersecting at 60-degree angles, the intersections should form a lattice where each point is shared by one horizontal line, one line with positive slope, and one line with negative slope.

each such intersection should be a vertex of several equilateral triangles.

given that the side length of each triangle is 
2
/
3
2/ 
3
​	
 , i need to see how these triangles fit into the grid formed by the lines.

maybe i can think about the area covered by these triangles and see how many fit into the region bounded by the lines.

but first, i need to find the area of one such equilateral triangle.

the area of an equilateral triangle with side length 
a
a is 
3
4
a
2
4
3
​	
 
​	
 a 
2
 .

so, for 
a
=
2
/
3
a=2/ 
3
​	
 , the area is 
3
4
⋅
(
2
3
)
2
=
3
4
⋅
4
3
=
3
3

​	
 
​	
 ⋅(

​	
 ) 
2
 = 
4
3
​	
 
​	
 ⋅ 
3
4
​	
 = 
3
3
​	
 
​	
 .

hmm, not sure if that helps directly.

maybe i should look at the pattern of these triangles within the grid formed by the lines.

each equilateral triangle should be bounded by one horizontal line, one line with positive slope, and one line with negative slope.

so, perhaps each such triangle corresponds to a specific combination of 
k
k values for the three lines.

wait, maybe i can think in terms of coordinates.

let’s consider the intersection points.

suppose we have a horizontal line 
y
=
k
y=k, a line with positive slope 
y
=
3
x
+
2
m
y= 
3
​	
 x+2m, and a line with negative slope 
y
=
−
3
x
+
2
n
y=− 
3
​	
 x+2n.

their intersection points would be:

- intersection of 
y
=
k
y=k and 
y
=
3
x
+
2
m
y= 
3
​	
 x+2m: 
x
=
(
k
−
2
m
)
/
3
x=(k−2m)/ 
3
​	
 , 
y
=
k
y=k.

- intersection of 
y
=
k
y=k and 
y
=
−
3
x
+
2
n
y=− 
3
​	
 x+2n: 
x
=
(
2
n
−
k
)
/
3
x=(2n−k)/ 
3
​	
 , 
y
=
k
y=k.

- intersection of 
y
=
3
x
+
2
m
y= 
3
​	
 x+2m and 
y
=
−
3
x
+
2
n
y=− 
3
​	
 x+2n: 
x
=
(
2
n
−
2
m
)
/
(
2
3
)
=
(
n
−
m
)
/
3
x=(2n−2m)/(2 
3
​	
 )=(n−m)/ 
3
​	
 , 
y
=
3
⋅
(
n
−
m
)
/
3
+
2
m
=
(
n
−
m
)
+
2
m
=
n
+
m
y= 
3
​	
 ⋅(n−m)/ 
3
​	
 +2m=(n−m)+2m=n+m.

so, the three vertices of a triangle would be:

1. 
(
k
−
2
m
3
,
k
)
( 
3
​	
 
k−2m
​	
 ,k)

2. 
(
2
n
−
k
3
,
k
)
( 
3
​	
 
2n−k
​	
 ,k)

3. 
(
n
−
m
3
,
n
+
m
)
( 
3
​	
 
n−m
​	
 ,n+m)

now, the side lengths should all be equal to 
2
/
3
2/ 
3
​	
 .

let me compute the distance between the first and second points:

distance 
d
d between 
(
k
−
2
m
3
,
k
)
( 
3
​	
 
k−2m
​	
 ,k) and 
(
2
n
−
k
3
,
k
)
( 
3
​	
 
2n−k
​	
 ,k):

d
=
(
2
n
−
k
−
(
k
−
2

)
3
)
2
+
(
k
−

)
2
=
(
2
n
−
k
−
k
+
2
m
3
)
2
=
∣
2
n
−
2
k
+
2
m
3
∣
=
2
∣
n
−
k
+
m
∣
3
d= 
( 
3
​	
 
2n−k−(k−2m)
​	
 ) 
2
 +(k−k) 
2
 
​	
 = 
( 
3
​	
 
2n−k−k+2m
​	
 ) 
2
 
​	
 = 
​	
  
3
​	
 
2n−2k+2m
​	
  
​	
 = 
3
​	
 
2∣n−k+m∣
​	
 .

this should be equal to 
2
/
3
2/ 
3
​	
 , so 
∣
n
−
k
+
m
∣
=
1
∣n−k+m∣=1.

similarly, distance between the second and third points:

d
=
(
n
−
m
3
−
2
n
−
k
3
)
2
+
(
n
+
m
−
k
)
2
=
(
−
n
−
m
+
k
3
)
2
+
(
n
+
m
−
k
)
2
d= 
( 
3
​	
 
n−m
​	
 − 
3
​	
 
2n−k
​	
 ) 
2
 +(n+m−k) 
2
 
​	
 = 
( 
3
​	
 
−n−m+k
​	
 ) 
2
 +(n+m−k) 
2
 
​	
 .

this seems messy. maybe there's a better way to approach this.

perhaps instead of focusing on the coordinates, i can think about the pattern these lines create.

these lines form a hexagonal lattice, where each intersection point is surrounded by six equilateral triangles.

but i'm supposed to count the number of such triangles formed by these specific lines.

given that 
k
k ranges from -10 to 10, inclusive, for each family of lines, but the horizontal lines have 
y
=
k
y=k, while the other lines have 
y
=
3
x
+
2
k
y= 
3
​	
 x+2k and 
y
=
−
3
x
+
2
k
y=− 
3
​	
 x+2k, i notice that the constants in these equations are scaled differently.

wait a minute, the horizontal lines have 
y
=
k
y=k, while the other lines have 
y
=
3
x
+
2
k
y= 
3
​	
 x+2k and 
y
=
−
3
x
+
2
k
y=− 
3
​	
 x+2k. the constants are scaled by 2 for the slanted lines.

this might be important in determining the spacing and how the triangles fit together.

let me try to visualize this.

if i plot the horizontal lines spaced 1 unit apart, and the other lines with slopes 
3
3
​	
  and 
−
3
− 
3
​	
 , spaced 2 units apart in their constants, it might create a specific pattern.

alternatively, maybe i can transform the coordinate system to simplify the problem.

perhaps by rotating the axes to align with the directions of the lines.

since the lines have angles of 0°, 60°, and -60° with respect to the x-axis, rotating the coordinate system by 30° might make things symmetric.

but that might be overcomplicating things.

alternatively, i could consider the dual lattice formed by these lines and try to count the number of fundamental regions (the equilateral triangles) within the bounded area.

wait, but the problem says "cut part of the plane", implying that the lines extend infinitely, but maybe they're confined to a certain region where these triangles are formed.

however, since lines extend infinitely, the arrangement would tile the entire plane with these equilateral triangles, but perhaps only a finite number are completely bounded by the given lines.

but with 
k
k ranging from -10 to 10, there are a finite number of lines, so the arrangement would not cover the entire plane, but only a finite portion.

i need to find how many equilateral triangles of side 
2
/
3
2/ 
3
​	
  are formed by these 63 lines.

maybe i can think in terms of the number of small triangles per unit area and then find the total area covered by the lines.

but that seems tricky.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that each small equilateral triangle is determined by three lines: one from each family.

that is, one horizontal line, one line with positive slope, and one line with negative slope.

each combination of one line from each family should form a triangle, but only if they intersect in a way that forms the equilateral triangle of the given side length.

given that, i can try to count the number of such triplets of lines that satisfy the condition for forming a triangle of side 
2
/
3
2/ 
3
​	
 .

from earlier, i had that 
∣
n
−
k
+
m
∣
=
1
∣n−k+m∣=1, where 
k
k, 
m
m, and 
n
n are the constants for the horizontal, positive-slope, and negative-slope lines, respectively.

wait, maybe that's a key relation.

if 
∣
n
−
k
+
m
∣
=
1
∣n−k+m∣=1, then for each triplet of lines 
y
=
k
y=k, 
y
=
3
x
+
2
m
y= 
3
​	
 x+2m, and 
y
=
−
3
x
+
2
n
y=− 
3
​	
 x+2n, the condition for forming a triangle of side 
2
/
3
2/ 
3
​	
  is 
∣
n
−
k
+
m
∣
=
1
∣n−k+m∣=1.

so, i need to count the number of integer triplets 
(
k
,
m
,
n
)
(k,m,n) with 
k
,
m
,
n
k,m,n ranging from -10 to 10, inclusive, and satisfying 
∣
n
−
k
+
m
∣
=
1
∣n−k+m∣=1.

that seems manageable.

first, note that 
k
k, 
m
m, and 
n
n are integers from -10 to 10.

so, the total number of possible triplets without any condition is 
21
×
21
×
21
=
9261
21×21×21=9261, but we need only those with 
∣
n
−
k
+
m
∣
=
1
∣n−k+m∣=1.

this is equivalent to 
n
−
k
+
m
=
1
n−k+m=1 or 
n
−
k
+
m
=
−
1
n−k+m=−1.

let me rearrange this equation to make it easier to count.

let’s consider 
n
+
m
−
k
=
1
n+m−k=1 and 
n
+
m
−
k
=
−
1
n+m−k=−1.

so, for each possible value of 
k
k, 
m
m, and 
n
n, if 
n
+
m
−
k
n+m−k is either 1 or -1, then that triplet forms a triangle of the desired side length.

now, to count the number of triplets satisfying this condition, i can fix two variables and solve for the third.

for example, fix 
k
k and 
m
m, then solve for 
n
n:

n
=
1
+
k
−
m
n=1+k−m or 
n
=
−
1
+
k
−
m
n=−1+k−m.

now, 
n
n must be an integer between -10 and 10, inclusive.

so, for each pair 
(
k
,
m
)
(k,m), there are either 0, 1, or 2 possible values of 
n
n that satisfy the condition, depending on whether 
1
+
k
−
m
1+k−m and 
−
1
+
k
−
m
−1+k−m are within the range [-10, 10].

therefore, for each 
(
k
,
m
)
(k,m), the number of valid 
n
n is:

- 2, if both 
1
+
k
−
m
1+k−m and 
−
1
+
k
−
m
−1+k−m are within [-10, 10].

- 1, if only one of them is within [-10, 10].

- 0, if neither is within [-10, 10].

so, to find the total number of triplets, i need to count, for each 
(
k
,
m
)
(k,m), how many of these 
n
n values are valid.

this seems a bit involved, but perhaps there's a smarter way.

alternatively, since the problem is symmetric in 
k
k, 
m
m, and 
n
n, maybe there's a way to exploit that symmetry.

alternatively, perhaps i can think about the number of solutions to the equation 
n
+
m
−
k
=
1
n+m−k=1 and 
n
+
m
−
k
=
−
1
n+m−k=−1 within the given ranges.

this is equivalent to 
n
+
m
−
k
=
±
1
n+m−k=±1.

let me consider the first equation: 
n
+
m
−
k
=
1
n+m−k=1.

i can rearrange it to 
n
+
m
=
k
+
1
n+m=k+1.

similarly, the second equation is 
n
+
m
=
k
−
1
n+m=k−1.

so, for each 
k
k, the number of 
(
m
,
n
)
(m,n) pairs that satisfy 
n
+
m
=
k
+
1
n+m=k+1 or 
n
+
m
=
k
−

n+m=k−1.

given that 
m
m and 
n
n range independently from -10 to 10, for each 
k
k, i can find the number of 
(
m
,
n
)
(m,n) pairs where 
n
+
m
=
k
+
1
n+m=k+1 or 
n
+
m
=
k
−
1
n+m=k−1.

this is similar to finding the number of integer solutions to 
n
+
m
=
c
n+m=c, where 
c
=
k
+
1
c=k+1 or 
c
=
k
−
1
c=k−1, with 
m
,
n
m,n in [-10, 10].

the number of integer solutions to 
n
+
m
=
c
n+m=c with 
m
,
n
m,n in [-10, 10] is:

- if 
c
c is between -20 and 20, the number of solutions is 
21
−
∣
c
∣
21−∣c∣ if 
∣
c
∣
≤
20
∣c∣≤20, else 0.

wait, actually, for 
m
m and 
n
n both ranging from -10 to 10, the possible sums 
c
=
m
+
n
c=m+n range from -20 to 20.

for a given 
c
c, the number of integer solutions is 
21
−
∣
c
∣
21−∣c∣, provided 
∣
c
∣
≤
20
∣c∣≤20.

so, for each 
k
k, the number of 
(
m
,
n
)
(m,n) pairs is 
(
21
−
∣
k
+

)
+
(
21

k

)
(21−∣k+1∣)+(21−∣k−1∣), provided that 
∣
k

1
∣
≤
20
∣k+1∣≤20 and 
∣
k
−

∣
≤
20
∣k−1∣≤20.

given that 
k
k ranges from -10 to 10, 
k
+
1
k+1 ranges from -9 to 11, and 
k
−
1
k−1 ranges from -11 to 9, all within -20 to 20, so no issues there.

therefore, the total number of triplets is the sum over 
k
=
−

k=−10 to 10 of 
(

+
(

(21−∣k+1∣)+(21−∣k−1∣).

let’s compute this sum.

first, note that for each

(

+
∣
k
−

)
(21−∣k+1∣)+(21−∣k−1∣)=42−(∣k+1∣+∣k−1∣).

now, 
∣
k
+
1
∣
+
∣
k

∣
∣k+1∣+∣k−1∣ can be simplified based on the value of

let’s consider different cases for

1. if

k≥1, then 
∣
k

=
k
+

∣k+1∣=k+1 and 
∣
k

=
k
−

∣k−1∣=k−1, so 
∣
k

k

=
(
k

)
+
(

=

k
∣k+1∣+∣k−1∣=(k+1)+(k−1)=2k.

2. if

k
<
1
−1≤k<1, then 
∣
k
+
1
∣
=
k
+
1
∣k+1∣=k+1 and 
∣
k
−
1
∣
=
1
−
k
∣k−1∣=1−k, so 
∣
k
+

∣
+
∣
k

=
(
k

)
+
(

−
k

=

∣k+1∣+∣k−1∣=(k+1)+(1−k)=2.

3. if 
k

k≤−1, then 
∣
k
+
1
∣
=
−
(
k

k
−

∣k+1∣=−(k+1)=−k−1 and

=

(
k

k

∣k−1∣=−(k−1)=−k+1, so

k

+
(

)
=

k
∣k+1∣+∣k−1∣=(−k−1)+(−k+1)=−2k.

therefore,

now, let's compute the sum over 
k
=
−
10
k=−10 to 10 of this expression.

let’s break it into three parts:

1. 
k
=
−
10
k=−10 to 
k
=
−
1
k=−1

2. 
k
=
−
0
k=−0 and 
k
=
0
k=0 (since -1 ≤ k < 1)

3. 
k
=
1
k=1 to 
k
=
10
k=10

wait, actually, for 
k
k integer, -1 ≤ k < 1 corresponds to k = -1, 0.

but according to the earlier cases:

- for 
k
≥
1
k≥1: use 42 - 2k

- for 
−
1
≤
k
<
1
−1≤k<1: use 40

- for 
k
≤
−
1
k≤−1: use 42 + 2k

wait, but k is integer, so 
k
≥
1
k≥1 is k = 1 to 10, and 
k
≤
−
1
k≤−1 is k = -10 to -1.

and 
−
1
≤
k
<
1
−1≤k<1 is k = -1 and k = 0.

wait, but k = -1 is included in both 
k
≤
−
1
k≤−1 and 
−
1
≤
k
<
1
−1≤k<1, which is overlapping.

i need to make sure that the cases are mutually exclusive.

let’s redefine:

- for 
k
≥
1
k≥1: 42 - 2k

- for 
k
=
0
k=0: 40

- for 
k
≤
−
1
k≤−1: 42 + 2k

this way, no overlapping.

now, sum over k from -10 to 10:

total triplets = sum from k = 1 to 10 of (42 - 2k) + sum from k = -10 to -1 of (42 + 2k) + 40 (for k = 0)

let’s compute each part separately.

first, sum from k = 1 to 10 of (42 - 2k):

this is 42*10 - 2*(sum from k=1 to 10 of k) = 420 - 2*(55) = 420 - 110 = 310.

next, sum from k = -10 to -1 of (42 + 2k):

let’s make a substitution: let m = -k, so when k = -10, m = 10, down to m = 1.

then the sum becomes sum from m=1 to 10 of (42 - 2m) = same as the previous sum, which is 310.

finally, add 40 for k=0.

therefore, total triplets = 310 + 310 + 40 = 660.

but wait, is this the number of equilateral triangles?

well, each triplet corresponds to one equilateral triangle, as per the condition 
∣
n
−
k
+
m
∣
=
1
∣n−k+m∣=1, which ensures that the triangle has side length 
2
/
3
2/ 
3
​	
 .

therefore, there should be 660 such triangles.

but, let's check if this makes sense.

given that there are 21 horizontal lines, 21 lines with positive slope, and 21 with negative slope, the total number of possible triplets is 21^3 = 9261, but only those with 
∣
n
−
k
+
m
∣
=
1
∣n−k+m∣=1 are valid, which we calculated to be 660.

does this seem reasonable?

alternatively, perhaps i made a miscalculation in the sum.

let me double-check the sums.

sum from k=1 to 10 of (42 - 2k):

this is 42*10 - 2*(1+2+...+10) = 420 - 2*55 = 420 - 110 = 310.

sum from k=-10 to -1 of (42 + 2k):

let’s compute it directly:

for k=-10: 42 + 2*(-10) = 42 - 20 = 22

k=-9: 42 + 2*(-9) = 42 - 18 = 24

...

k=-1: 42 + 2*(-1) = 42 - 2 = 40

so, the sequence is 22, 24, 26, ..., 40.

this is an arithmetic sequence with first term 22, last term 40, and common difference 2.

number of terms: from k=-10 to -1 is 10 terms.

sum = (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term) = 10/2 * (22 + 40) = 5 * 62 = 310.

yes, same as before.

then, add 40 for k=0.

total triplets: 310 + 310 + 40 = 660.

therefore, there should be 660 such equilateral triangles formed by these lines.

but, just to be sure, maybe i should consider if some triangles are being counted multiple times or if there are overlaps.

wait, each triangle is determined uniquely by one horizontal line, one positive-slope line, and one negative-slope line that satisfy the condition 
∣
n
−
k
+
m
∣
=
1
∣n−k+m∣=1, so it should be a unique correspondence.

therefore, 660 seems to be the correct count.

**final answer**

660
