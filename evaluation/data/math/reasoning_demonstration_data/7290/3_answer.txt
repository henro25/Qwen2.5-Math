Answer: Given the equations of the lines:

1. \( y = k \) for \( k = -10, -9, \ldots, 10 \) (21 lines),
2. \( y = \sqrt{3}x + 2k \) for \( k = -10, -9, \ldots, 10 \) (21 lines),
3. \( y = -\sqrt{3}x + 2k \) for \( k = -10, -9, \ldots, 10 \) (21 lines),

these lines form equilateral triangles with side length \( \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \).

to find the number of such triangles, we need to count the number of triplets \((k, m, n)\) that satisfy the condition \( |n - k + m| = 1 \).

the total number of triplets is calculated as follows:

1. for \( k \geq 1 \):
   \[
   \sum_{k=1}^{10} (42 - 2k) = 42 \times 10 - 2 \times \sum_{k=1}^{10} k = 420 - 2 \times 55 = 420 - 110 = 310
   \]

2. for \( k \leq -1 \):
   \[
   \sum_{k=-10}^{-1} (42 + 2k) = \sum_{m=1}^{10} (42 - 2m) = 42 \times 10 - 2 \times \sum_{m=1}^{10} m = 420 - 110 = 310
   \]

3. for \( k = 0 \):
   \[
   40
   \]

adding these together:
\[
310 + 310 + 40 = 660
\]

thus, the number of equilateral triangles formed is:
\[
\boxed{660}
\]
