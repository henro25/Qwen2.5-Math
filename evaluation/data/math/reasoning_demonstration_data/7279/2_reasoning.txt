Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: if 
x
2017
−
2
x
+
1
=
0
x 
2017
 −2x+1=0 and 
x
≠
1
x

=1, find the value of 
x
2016
+
x
2015
+
⋯
+
x
+
1
x 
2016
 +x 
2015
 +⋯+x+1. okay, let's see how to approach this.

first off, the expression 
x
2016
+
x
2015
+
⋯
+
x
+
1
x 
2016
 +x 
2015
 +⋯+x+1 looks familiar. it's a geometric series, right? the sum of a geometric series where the first term is 1 and the common ratio is 
x
x, up to 
x
2016
x 
2016
 . there's a formula for that: 
s
=
x
n
−
1
x
−
1
s= 
x−1
x 
n
 −1
​	
 , where 
n
n is the highest exponent. in this case, 
n
=
2017
n=2017, but wait, the highest exponent is 2016. so maybe i need to adjust that.

actually, the sum 
x
2016
+
x
2015
+
⋯
+
x
+
1
x 
2016
 +x 
2015
 +⋯+x+1 is 
x
2017
−
1
x
−
1
x−1
x 
2017
 −1
​	
 , because the number of terms is 2017 (from 
x
0
x 
0
  to 
x
2016
x 
2016
 ), and the formula is 
s
=
x
n
−
1
x
−
1
s= 
x−1
x 
n
 −1
​	
 , where 
n
=
2017
n=2017.

so, 
s
=
x
2017
−
1
x
−
1
s= 
x−1
x 
2017
 −1
​	
 .

but from the given equation, 
x
2017
−
2
x
+
1
=
0
x 
2017
 −2x+1=0, so 
x
2017
=
2
x
−
1
x 
2017
 =2x−1. maybe i can substitute that into the expression for 
s
s:

s
=
2
x
−
1
−
1
x
−
1
=
2
x
−
2
x
−
1
=
2
(
x
−
1
)
x
−
1
s= 
x−1
2x−1−1
​	
 = 
x−1
2x−2
​	
 = 
x−1
2(x−1)
​	
 .

oh, nice! the 
x
−
1
x−1 cancels out, so 
s
=
2
s=2, provided that 
x
≠
1
x

=1, which is given.

wait a second, is there anything i'm missing here? the problem seems almost too straightforward with that substitution. maybe i should double-check.

let me verify the formula for the sum of a geometric series. the sum 
s
=
1
+
x
+
x
2
+
⋯
+
x
n
−
1
=
x
n
−
1
x
−
1
s=1+x+x 
2
 +⋯+x 
n−1
 = 
x−1
x 
n
 −1
​	
 , right? in this case, 
n
=
2017
n=2017, so 
s
=
x
2017
−
1
x
−
1
s= 
x−1
x 
2017
 −1
​	
 . that matches what i did earlier.

and plugging in 
x
2017
=
2
x
−
1
x 
2017
 =2x−1 from the original equation seems correct. then simplifying gives 
s
=
2
s=2.

just to be thorough, maybe i can consider if there's another way to approach this, in case i've overlooked something.

another way could be to factor the original equation. let's see: 
x
2017
−
2
x
+
1
=
0
x 
2017
 −2x+1=0. factoring such a high-degree polynomial seems tough, but maybe i can factor it as 
x
(
x
2016
−
2
)
+
1
=
0
x(x 
2016
 −2)+1=0, but that doesn't seem helpful.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the expression 
x
2016
+
x
2015
+
⋯
+
x
+
1
x 
2016
 +x 
2015
 +⋯+x+1 as 
x
2017
−
1
x
−
1
x−1
x 
2017
 −1
​	
 , which i already did.

wait, maybe i can think about the roots of the equation 
x
2017
−
2
x
+
1
=
0
x 
2017
 −2x+1=0. if 
x
≠
1
x

=1, then dividing both sides by 
x
−
1
x−1 should be valid, as long as 
x
≠
1
x

=1, which it isn't.

alternatively, perhaps using polynomial division or something like that, but it seems unnecessary since the substitution method worked smoothly.

is there a possibility that the sum could be something else? maybe if 
x
=
1
x=1, but the problem states 
x
≠
1
x

=1, so that's not an issue here.

i'm starting to feel confident that the sum is indeed 2.

let me try plugging in a value for 
x
x that satisfies the original equation to see if it holds. for example, suppose 
x
=
1
x=1, but wait, 
x
≠
1
x

=1. maybe 
x
=
0
x=0, but then the original equation becomes 
0
−
0
+
1
=
1
≠
0
0−0+1=1

=0, so that's not a solution.

perhaps 
x
=
−
1
x=−1. plugging into the original equation: 
(
−
1
)
2017
−
2
(
−
1
)
+
1
=
−
1
+
2
+
1
=
2
≠
0
(−1) 
2017
 −2(−1)+1=−1+2+1=2

=0, so not a solution.

maybe 
x
=
1
/
2
x=1/2. then 
(
1
/
2
)
2017
−
2
∗
(
1
/
2
)
+
1
(1/2) 
2017
 −2∗(1/2)+1. that's a very small number minus 1 plus 1, which is approximately 0, but not exactly. not sure.

actually, solving for 
x
x in 
x
2017
−
2
x
+
1
=
0
x 
2017
 −2x+1=0 analytically seems impractical due to the high degree, so plugging in specific values isn't helpful here.

given that, i think the substitution method is the most straightforward and reliable approach. therefore, the sum 
x
2016
+
x
2015
+
⋯
+
x
+
1
=
2
x 
2016
 +x 
2015
 +⋯+x+1=2.

**final answer**
