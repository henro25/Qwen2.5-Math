Answer: To compute \(\cos 210^\circ\), we can use the unit circle and properties of trigonometric functions in different quadrants.

1. recognize that \(210^\circ\) is in the third quadrant, where cosine values are negative.
2. express \(210^\circ\) as \(180^\circ + 30^\circ\).
3. use the formula for cosine of a sum of angles: \(\cos(180^\circ + x) = -\cos(x)\).
4. therefore, \(\cos(210^\circ) = \cos(180^\circ + 30^\circ) = -\cos(30^\circ)\).
5. recall that \(\cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

thus, \(\cos(210^\circ) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

\[
\boxed{-\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}
\]
