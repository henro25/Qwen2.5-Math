Reasoning: So i need to find the value of cos 210 degrees. hmm, i'm a bit rusty on trigonometry, but i remember that the unit circle is a good way to approach this. let me recall some basics.

first, the unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1, and angles are measured from the positive x-axis going counterclockwise. so, 210 degrees is more than 180 degrees but less than 270 degrees, which means it's in the third quadrant of the unit circle.

i also remember that in the third quadrant, both sine and cosine values are negative. wait, is that right? let me think. in the first quadrant, both are positive; in the second, sine is positive and cosine is negative; in the third, both are negative; and in the fourth, sine is negative and cosine is positive. yeah, so in the third quadrant, cosine is negative.

now, 210 degrees is 180 degrees plus 30 degrees. so, it's 180 + 30. i think there's a formula for cosine of (180 + x). let me see... oh, right! there's a formula for cosine of (180 degrees + x), which is cos(180 + x) = -cos(x). wait, is that correct?

let me verify that. i know that cos(180 + x) = -cos(x), and sin(180 + x) = -sin(x). yes, that seems right. so, cos(210) = cos(180 + 30) = -cos(30).

okay, so i need to find cos(30 degrees) and then take its negative. i remember that cos(30 degrees) is √3/2. so, cos(210 degrees) should be -√3/2.

wait a minute, let me double-check that. maybe i should recall the exact values of cosine for common angles. cos(0) is 1, cos(30) is √3/2, cos(45) is √2/2, cos(60) is 1/2, and cos(90) is 0. yeah, that's correct.

but to be thorough, maybe i should use the unit circle coordinates for 210 degrees. the coordinates on the unit circle for an angle θ are (cos θ, sin θ). for 210 degrees, since it's in the third quadrant, both coordinates should be negative.

i can also think of 210 degrees as 180 + 30 degrees, so the reference angle is 30 degrees. the reference angle is the acute angle that the terminal side makes with the x-axis. so, for 210 degrees, the reference angle is 30 degrees.

in the third quadrant, cosine is negative, so cos(210) = -cos(30) = -√3/2.

alternatively, i could use the formula for cosine of a sum of angles. the formula is cos(a + b) = cos a cos b - sin a sin b. so, cos(180 + 30) = cos 180 cos 30 - sin 180 sin 30.

i know that cos 180 is -1, sin 180 is 0, cos 30 is √3/2, and sin 30 is 1/2.

plugging in the values: cos(210) = (-1)(√3/2) - (0)(1/2) = -√3/2 - 0 = -√3/2.

so, that confirms my earlier result.

just to be extra sure, maybe i can look at the sine and cosine values for 210 degrees using the unit circle coordinates.

for 210 degrees, the coordinates are (cos 210, sin 210). since it's 180 + 30, the x-coordinate should be -cos(30), and the y-coordinate should be -sin(30). so, cos 210 = -cos(30) = -√3/2, and sin 210 = -sin(30) = -1/2.

yes, that matches what i got before.

i think that's solid. so, the value of cos 210 degrees is -√3/2.
