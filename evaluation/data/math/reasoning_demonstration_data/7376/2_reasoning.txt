Reasoning: So i need to find the number of quadratic functions of the form 
f
(
x
)
=
a
x
2
+
b
x
+
c
f(x)=ax 
2
 +bx+c that satisfy the equation 
f
(
x
)
f
(
−
x
)
=
f
(
x
2
)
f(x)f(−x)=f(x 
2
 ). okay, let's start by understanding what this equation is saying.

first, 
f
(
x
)
f(x) is a quadratic function, so it's a parabola. 
f
(
−
x
)
f(−x) would be the reflection of 
f
(
x
)
f(x) over the y-axis because replacing 
x
x with 
−
x
−x reflects the graph over the y-axis. then, the product 
f
(
x
)
f
(
−
x
)
f(x)f(−x) should equal 
f
(
x
2
)
f(x 
2
 ), which is another quadratic function but with 
x
2
x 
2
  as the input.

let me write down what each of these expressions is:

f
(
x
)
=
a
x
2
+
b
x
+
c
f(x)=ax 
2
 +bx+c

f
(
−
x
)
=
a
(
−
x
)
2
+
b
(
−
x
)
+
c
=
a
x
2
−
b
x
+
c
f(−x)=a(−x) 
2
 +b(−x)+c=ax 
2
 −bx+c

so, 
f
(
x
)
f
(
−
x
)
=
(
a
x
2
+
b
x
+
c
)
(
a
x
2
−
b
x
+
c
)
f(x)f(−x)=(ax 
2
 +bx+c)(ax 
2
 −bx+c)

let me expand this product:

(
a
x
2
+
b
x
+
c
)
(
a
x
2
−
b
x
+
c
)
=

 +ax 
2
 ⋅(−bx)+ax 
2
 ⋅c+bx⋅ax 
2
 +bx⋅(−bx)+bx⋅c+c⋅ax 
2
 +c⋅(−bx)+c⋅c

simplifying each term:

now, combine like terms:

- 
x

x

 : 
a

x

-

- constant:

so, 
f
(

)
f
(
−

)
=

+
(

c
2
f(x)f(−x)=a 
2
 x 
4
 +(2ac−b 
2
 )x 
2
 +c 
2
 

now, let's find 
f
(
x
2
)
f(x 
2
 ):

f
(
x
2
)
=
a
(
x

)
2
+
b
(
x

)
+
c
=
a
x
4
+
b
x
2
+
c
f(x 
2
 )=a(x 
2
 ) 
2
 +b(x 
2
 )+c=ax 
4
 +bx 
2
 +c

according to the given equation, 
f
(
x
)
f
(
−
x
)
=
f
(
x
2
)
f(x)f(−x)=f(x 
2
 ), so:

a
2
x
4
+
(
2
a
c
−
b
2
)
x
2
+
c
2
=
a
x

+
b
x
2
+
c
a 
2
 x 
4
 +(2ac−b 
2
 )x 
2
 +c 
2
 =ax 
4
 +bx 
2
 +c

now, since two polynomials are equal for all 
x
x, their corresponding coefficients must be equal. so, we can set up the following equations by equating the coefficients of like terms:

1. coefficient of 
x
4
x 
4
 : 
a
2
=
a
a 
2
 =a

2. coefficient of 
x
2
x 
2
 : 
2
a
c
−
b
2
=
b
2ac−b 
2
 =b

3. constant term: 
c
2
=
c
c 
2
 =c

alright, now i have a system of three equations:

1. 
a
2
=
a
a 
2
 =a

2. 
2
a
c
−
b
2
=
b
2ac−b 
2
 =b

3. 
c
2
=
c
c 
2
 =c

i need to solve this system for 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c.

let's start with equation 1: 
a
2
=
a
a 
2
 =a

this can be rewritten as 
a
2
−
a
=
0
a 
2
 −a=0, which factors to 
a
(
a
−
1
)
=
0
a(a−1)=0, so 
a
=
0
a=0 or 
a
=
1
a=1.

similarly, equation 3: 
c
2
=
c
c 
2
 =c

this is 
c
2
−
c
=
0
c 
2
 −c=0, which factors to 
c
(
c
−
1
)
=
0
c(c−1)=0, so 
c
=
0
c=0 or 
c
=
1
c=1.

so, possible values for 
a
a and 
c
c are:

- 
a
=
0
a=0, 
c
=
0
c=0

- 
a
=
0
a=0, 
c
=
1
c=1

- 
a
=
1
a=1, 
c
=
0
c=0

- 
a
=
1
a=1, 
c
=
1
c=1

now, for each pair of 
a
a and 
c
c, i need to find the corresponding 
b
b that satisfies equation 2: 
2
a
c
−
b
2
=
b
2ac−b 
2
 =b

let's consider each case:

**case 1:** 
a
=
0
a=0, 
c
=
0
c=0

plug into equation 2:

2
(
0
)
(
0
)
−
b
2
=
b
2(0)(0)−b 
2
 =b → 
0
−
b
2
=
b
0−b 
2
 =b → 
−
b
2
=
b
−b 
2
 =b → 
b
2
+
b
=
0
b 
2
 +b=0 → 
b
(
b
+
1
)
=
0
b(b+1)=0

so, 
b
=
0
b=0 or 
b
=
−
1
b=−1

therefore, two solutions in this case:

- 
a
=
0
a=0, 
b
=
0
b=0, 
c
=
0
c=0

- 
a
=
0
a=0, 
b
=
−
1
b=−1, 
c
=
0
c=0

**case 2:** 
a
=
0
a=0, 
c
=
1
c=1

plug into equation 2:

2
(
0
)
(
1
)
−
b
2
=
b
2(0)(1)−b 
2
 =b → 
0
−
b
2
=
b
0−b 
2
 =b → 
−
b
2
=
b
−b 
2
 =b → 
b
2
+
b
=
0
b 
2
 +b=0 → 
b
(
b
+
1
)
=
0
b(b+1)=0

again, 
b
=
0
b=0 or 
b
=
−
1
b=−1

so, two more solutions:

- 
a
=
0
a=0, 
b
=
0
b=0, 
c
=
1
c=1

- 
a
=
0
a=0, 
b
=
−
1
b=−1, 
c
=
1
c=1

**case 3:** 
a
=
1
a=1, 
c
=
0
c=0

plug into equation 2:

2
(
1
)
(
0
)
−
b
2
=
b
2(1)(0)−b 
2
 =b → 
0
−
b
2
=
b
0−b 
2
 =b → 
−
b
2
=
b
−b 
2
 =b → 
b
2
+
b
=
0
b 
2
 +b=0 → 
b
(
b
+
1
)
=
0
b(b+1)=0

thus, 
b
=
0
b=0 or 
b
=
−
1
b=−1

two more solutions:

- 
a
=
1
a=1, 
b
=
0
b=0, 
c
=
0
c=0

- 
a
=
1
a=1, 
b
=
−
1
b=−1, 
c
=
0
c=0

**case 4:** 
a
=
1
a=1, 
c
=
1
c=1

plug into equation 2:

2
(
1
)
(
1
)
−
b
2
=
b
2(1)(1)−b 
2
 =b → 
2
−
b
2
=
b
2−b 
2
 =b → 
−
b
2
−
b
+
2
=
0
−b 
2
 −b+2=0 → 
b
2
+
b
−
2
=
0
b 
2
 +b−2=0

now, solve for 
b
b:

quadratic equation: 
b
2
+
b
−
2
=
0
b 
2
 +b−2=0

using the quadratic formula:

b
=
−
1
±
1
+
8
2
=
−
1
±
3
2
b= 
2
−1± 
1+8
​	
 
​	
 = 
2
−1±3
​	
 

so, 
b
=
−
1
+
3
2
=
1
b= 
2
−1+3
​	
 =1 or 
b
=
−
1
−
3
2
=
−
2
b= 
2
−1−3
​	
 =−2

therefore, two more solutions:

- 
a
=
1
a=1, 
b
=
1
b=1, 
c
=
1
c=1

- 
a
=
1
a=1, 
b
=
−
2
b=−2, 
c
=
1
c=1

now, let's count all the solutions we've found:

- from case 1: 2 solutions

- from case 2: 2 solutions

- from case 3: 2 solutions

- from case 4: 2 solutions

total: 8 solutions

wait a minute, let me double-check if all these solutions actually satisfy the original equation 
f
(
x
)
f
(
−
x
)
=
f
(
x
2
)
f(x)f(−x)=f(x 
2
 ). it's always good to verify.

let's pick one from each case and check.

**first solution:** 
a
=
0
a=0, 
b
=
0
b=0, 
c
=
0
c=0

then, 
f
(
x

=
0
f(x)=0

so, 
f
(
x
)
f
(
−
x
)
=

×
0
=
0
f(x)f(−x)=0×0=0

and 
f
(
x

)
=
0
f(x 
2
 )=0

so, 
0
=
0
0=0, which holds.

**second solution:** 
a
=
0
a=0, 
b
=
−
1
b=−1, 
c
=
0
c=0

f
(
x
)
=
−
x
f(x)=−x

then, 
f
(

f

=
(

(

=
−
x

f(x)f(−x)=(−x)(x)=−x 
2
 

and 
f
(
x

)
=
−
x

f(x

so,

 , which holds.

**third solution:** 
a
=

a=0, 
b
=
0
b=0, 
c
=
1
c=1

f
(
x
)
=

f(x)=1

then, 
f
(

f
(
−

=

×
1
=
1
f(x)f(−x)=1×1=1

and 
f
(
x

)
=
1
f(x 
2
 )=1

so, 
1
=
1
1=1, which holds.

**fourth solution:** 
a
=

a=0, 
b

b=−1, 
c
=
1
c=1

f
(
x
)
=
−
x

f(x)=−x+1

then, 
f
(

f

f(x)f(−x)=(−x+1)(x+1)=−x 
2
 −x+x+1=−x 
2

and 
f
(
x
2
)
=
−
x
2
+
1
f(x 
2

2

so, 
−
x
2

1
=
−
x

−x 
2

2

**fifth solution:** 
a

b
=
0
b=0, 
c
=
0
c=0

f
(
x

=

f(x)=x

then, 
f

f

x
2
=
x

f(x)f(−x)=x

and 
f

2
=
x

f(x

2

so, 
x

x

 , which holds.

**sixth solution:** 
a

a=1, 
b

c

c=0

f
(

then,

f(x

f

alright, all eight solutions satisfy the original equation.

therefore, the number of such quadratic functions is 8.
