Answer: 1. **Identify the given values:**
   - Damage in Australian dollars (AUD): $30,000,000

   - To find the equivalent in USD, divide the amount in AUD by the exchange rate (1.5 AUD per USD).

3. **Perform the calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Damage in USD} = \frac{30,000,000 \text{ AUD}}{1.5 \text{ AUD/USD}} = 20,000,000 \text{ USD}
   \]

4. **Verification:**
   - 20,000,000 USD Ã— 1.5 AUD/USD = 30,000,000 AUD, which confirms the calculation is correct.
