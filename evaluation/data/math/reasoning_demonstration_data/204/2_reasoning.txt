Reasoning: Alright, so I've got this problem here about a storm in Sydney that caused $30 million in damage, but that's in Australian dollars. And I need to figure out how much that is in American dollars. They've also given me the exchange rate: 1.5 Australian dollars equal 1 American dollar.

Okay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. I have an amount in Australian dollars, and I need to convert it to American dollars. The exchange rate tells me how much one currency is worth in terms of the other. So, 1.5 AUD = 1 USD.

I think I need to set up a conversion equation here. If 1.5 AUD is equal to 1 USD, then to find out how many USD 30 million AUD is, I should probably divide the amount in AUD by the exchange rate.

Wait, is that right? Let me think again. If 1.5 AUD = 1 USD, then to find out how much 1 AUD is in USD, I should divide 1 by 1.5, which is approximately 0.6667 USD per AUD. But that seems a bit messy.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this. If 1.5 AUD is equal to 1 USD, then to find out how many USD I have in 30 million AUD, I can set up a proportion.

So, 1.5 AUD / 1 USD = 30,000,000 AUD / X USD.

To solve for X, I can cross-multiply: 1.5 AUD * X USD = 30,000,000 AUD * 1 USD.

So, X = 30,000,000 AUD / 1.5 AUD/USD.

That makes sense. So, dividing 30 million AUD by 1.5 AUD per USD should give me the amount in USD.

Let me do the calculation: 30,000,000 divided by 1.5.

Well, 1.5 times 20,000,000 is 30,000,000, so X should be 20,000,000 USD.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. If I have 20 million USD and the exchange rate is 1.5 AUD per USD, then 20 million times 1.5 should give me 30 million AUD, which matches the original amount. So, yeah, that seems correct.

I think I've got it. The storm caused 20 million US dollars in damage.
