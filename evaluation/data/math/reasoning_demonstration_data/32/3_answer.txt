Answer: To solve the equation \(\frac{r+3}{r-2} = \frac{r-1}{r+1}\), we start by cross-multiplying:

\[
(r + 3)(r + 1) = (r - 1)(r - 2)
\]

expanding both sides:

\[
(r + 3)(r + 1) = r^2 + r + 3r + 3 = r^2 + 4r + 3
\]

\[
(r - 1)(r - 2) = r^2 - 2r - r + 2 = r^2 - 3r + 2
\]

setting the expanded forms equal to each other:

\[
r^2 + 4r + 3 = r^2 - 3r + 2
\]

subtracting \(r^2\) from both sides:

\[
4r + 3 = -3r + 2
\]

adding \(3r\) to both sides:

\[
7r + 3 = 2
\]

subtracting 3 from both sides:

\[
7r = -1
\]

dividing by 7:

\[
r = -\frac{1}{7}
\]

finally, we verify that \(r = -\frac{1}{7}\) does not make any denominators zero and checks out in the original equation. thus, the solution is:

\[
\boxed{-\frac{1}{7}}
\]
