okay, first off, i need to find θ such that its cosine equals this combination of sines and cosines. it looks a bit messy, but maybe i can simplify the right-hand side.

let me see... i know some exact values for sine and cosine of specific angles. for example:

- sin 60° = √3/2

- cos 42°, sin 12°, and cos 6° don't have simple exact values that i can recall, so maybe i need to find another way to simplify this expression.

perhaps i can use some trigonometric identities to combine these terms. i remember that there are sum and difference formulas, product-to-sum identities, and other such tools.

wait, maybe i can group the terms differently. let's try to pair them:

sin

sin60 
∘
 −sin12 
∘
 +cos42 
∘
 −cos6 
∘
 .
now, i recall that there are formulas for the difference of sines and the difference of cosines.

for the difference of sines:

sin

a
−
sin

b
=
2
cos

(

)
sin

)
.
sina−sinb=2cos( 
2
a+b
​
 )sin(

​
 ).
and for the difference of cosines:

cos

.
cosa−cosb=−2sin(

 )sin(

 ).
let me apply these identities to the pairs.

hmm, that seems a bit better. maybe i can simplify

sin

wait a minute, i recall that

cosθ=sin(90

similarly,

so,

now, i can apply the difference of sines formula again:

so, plugging this back in:

 .
this seems to be getting more complicated. maybe there's a different approach.

let me consider using sum-to-product identities or other trigonometric identities to simplify the original expression.

alternatively, maybe i can compute the numerical values of each term and then sum them up to find the value of 
cos
⁡
θ
cosθ, and then find θ from there.

let's try that.

first, find sin 60°, cos 42°, sin 12°, and cos 6°.

- sin 60° = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

- cos 42° ≈ 0.7431

- sin 12° ≈ 0.2079

- cos 6° ≈ 0.9945

now, plug these into the expression:

cos
⁡
θ
=
0.8660
+
0.7431
−
0.2079
−
0.9945
cosθ=0.8660+0.7431−0.2079−0.9945
let's calculate that step by step:

first, 0.8660 + 0.7431 = 1.6091

then, 0.2079 + 0.9945 = 1.2024

now, 1.6091 - 1.2024 = 0.4067

so, 
cos
⁡
θ
≈
0.4067
cosθ≈0.4067

now, to find θ, we take the arccosine of 0.4067.

using a calculator, arccos(0.4067) ≈ 66 degrees.

so, θ ≈ 66°

but the problem asks for the smallest positive angle θ for which this holds. since cosine is positive in the first and fourth quadrants, the general solutions for θ would be θ = 66° + 360°k and θ = -66° + 360°k, where k is an integer.

the smallest positive angle would be 66°, since subtracting 66° from 360° would give 294°, which is larger than 66°.

therefore, θ = 66°.

wait, but i should check if there's a smaller positive angle that satisfies the equation. maybe i made a mistake in the calculation.

let me double-check the numerical values and the arithmetic.

sin 60° = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660 (correct)

cos 42° ≈ 0.7431 (correct)

sin 12° ≈ 0.2079 (correct)

cos 6° ≈ 0.9945 (correct)

now, 0.8660 + 0.7431 = 1.6091

0.2079 + 0.9945 = 1.2024

1.6091 - 1.2024 = 0.4067

arccos(0.4067) ≈ 66° (correct)

alternatively, maybe i can use more precise values for the trigonometric functions to get a more accurate result.

let me use more decimal places:

sin 60° = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660254

cos 42° ≈ 0.7431448

sin 12° ≈ 0.2079117

cos 6° ≈ 0.9945219

now, 0.8660254 + 0.7431448 = 1.6091702

0.2079117 + 0.9945219 = 1.2024336

1.6091702 - 1.2024336 = 0.4067366

now, find arccos(0.4067366)

using a calculator, cos⁻¹(0.4067366) ≈ 66 degrees.

still, θ ≈ 66°.

but perhaps i should consider that θ could be in the fourth quadrant as well, where cosine is also positive. the general solution for θ would be θ = ±66° + 360°k, where k is any integer.

the smallest positive angle would indeed be 66°, as angles larger than 360° are not considered smaller.

wait, but 66° is less than 180°, and cosine is positive there.

alternatively, perhaps there's a way to express the original expression in terms of a single cosine function, which might reveal a more straightforward angle.

let me try another approach.

starting again with:

cos

.
cosθ=sin60 
∘
 +cos42 
∘
 −sin12 
∘
 −cos6 
∘
 .
maybe i can use angle addition formulas or look for patterns.

i notice that 60°, 42°, 12°, and 6° are all multiples of 6°, which might hint at some underlying pattern.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider expressing all terms in terms of sine or cosine of the same angle.

wait, another idea: use the identity 
cos
⁡
θ
=
sin
⁡
(
9
0
∘
−
θ
)
cosθ=sin(90 
∘
 −θ), but i'm not sure if that directly helps here.

alternatively, maybe i can consider using complex numbers or euler's formula, but that might be overkill for this problem.

let me try to see if there's a telescoping pattern or if the terms cancel out in some way.

alternatively, perhaps i can rearrange the terms:

cos
⁡
θ
=
(
sin
⁡

)
.
cosθ=(sin60 
∘
 −sin12 
∘
 )+(cos42 
∘
 −cos6 
∘
 ).
we already did that earlier.

alternatively, perhaps i can use sum-to-product identities for the pairs.

wait, perhaps i can consider expressing all in terms of sine functions.

since

alternatively, perhaps i can look for patterns or use multiple-angle identities.

wait, maybe i can consider that 60° - 12° = 48°, and 42° + 6° = 48°, but that seems coincidental.

alternatively, perhaps there's a way to write the expression as a single trigonometric function.

let me consider using the sum-to-product identities again, but differently.

this seems to be getting more complicated rather than simpler. maybe this path isn't the best.

let me consider another approach. perhaps using the sine and cosine addition formulas to combine some angles.

alternatively, maybe i can consider expressing everything in terms of sine functions only or cosine functions only.

wait, perhaps i can use the identity for 
cos

cos(a−b), but i'm not sure.

alternatively, maybe i can consider that 42° and 6° are related to 48°, and 60° and 12° are related to 48° as well.

wait, 60° - 12° = 48°, and 42° + 6° = 48°, as i noticed earlier.

maybe there's a way to use that.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider writing all angles in terms of 6°, since all are multiples of 6°.

let me see:

60° = 10 * 6°

42° = 7 * 6°

12° = 2 * 6°

6° = 1 * 6°

but i'm not sure if that helps directly.

wait, maybe i can consider using multiple-angle identities for sine and cosine.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider using the sine and cosine of complementary angles.

alternatively, maybe i can consider the sum of angles or difference of angles in some way.

wait, perhaps i can consider that 60° - 42° = 18°, and 42° - 6° = 36°, but again, not sure.

alternatively, maybe i can consider using the sine of supplementary angles, but that may not help here.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider expressing the entire right-hand side as a single sine or cosine function using sum formulas.

maybe i can group them differently.

let me try grouping

first,

using the identity

sina−cosb=sina−sin(90

sin

−
sin

sina−sin(90

then, using the difference of sines formula:

=

so,

similarly, for

so, combining both parts:

this still seems complicated. maybe there's a better way.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider using the sine and cosine of complementary angles again.

wait, perhaps i can consider that

=
sin

∘
cos6

 =sin84

 , so the expression becomes:

now, perhaps i can group

this still doesn't seem to simplify easily. maybe i need to accept that numerical approximation is the way to go here.

given that, i already calculated that 
cos
⁡
θ
≈
0.4067
cosθ≈0.4067, leading to θ ≈ 66°.

to ensure this is the smallest positive angle, i should consider that cosine is periodic with period 360°, and within 0° to 360°, cosine is positive in the first and fourth quadrants.

therefore, the two solutions within 0° to 360° are θ ≈ 66° and θ ≈ 360° - 66° = 294°.

since 66° is smaller than 294°, the smallest positive angle is 66°.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider using more precise calculations to confirm the value.

let me calculate the exact value using more precise trigonometric values.

first, sin 60° = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660254

cos 42° ≈ 0.7431448

sin 12° ≈ 0.2079117

cos 6° ≈ 0.9945219

now, sum them up:

0.8660254 + 0.7431448 = 1.6091702

0.2079117 + 0.9945219 = 1.2024336

difference: 1.6091702 - 1.2024336 = 0.4067366

now, find θ such that cos θ = 0.4067366.

using a calculator, arccos(0.4067366) ≈ 66 degrees.

alternatively, using a more precise calculator:

cos⁻¹(0.4067366) ≈ 66.000°, which suggests that θ = 66° is indeed the solution.

therefore, the smallest positive angle θ is 66 degrees.

**final answer**
