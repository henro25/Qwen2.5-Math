Problem: Let $a^2=\frac{16}{44}$ and $b^2=\frac{(2+\sqrt{5})^2}{11}$, where $a$ is a negative real number and $b$ is a positive real number. If $(a+b)^3$ can be expressed in the simplified form $\frac{x\sqrt{y}}{z}$ where $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive integers, what is the value of the sum $x+y+z$?
