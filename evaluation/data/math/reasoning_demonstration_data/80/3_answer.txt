Answer: Given the side of a square is \((x-2)\) and the dimensions of a rectangle are \((x-3)\) and \((x+4)\), we know that the area of the rectangle is twice the area of the square. 

first, we express the areas:
- area of the square: \((x-2)^2\)
- area of the rectangle: \((x-3)(x+4)\)

the relationship given is:
\[
(x-3)(x+4) = 2(x-2)^2
\]

expanding both sides:
\[
(x-3)(x+4) = x^2 + x - 12
\]
\[
2(x-2)^2 = 2(x^2 - 4x + 4) = 2x^2 - 8x + 8
\]

setting the equation to zero:
\[
x^2 + x - 12 = 2x^2 - 8x + 8
\]
\[
0 = x^2 - 9x + 20
\]

solving the quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 9x + 20 = 0
\]
factoring:
\[
(x-5)(x-4) = 0
\]
thus, \(x = 5\) or \(x = 4\).

both values are valid as they satisfy the original conditions and are greater than 3, ensuring positive dimensions for the rectangle.

the sum of the possible values of \(x\) is:
\[
5 + 4 = 9
\]

therefore, the sum of the possible values of \(x\) is:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]
