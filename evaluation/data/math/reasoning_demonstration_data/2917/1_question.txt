Problem: $ABCD$ is a rectangular sheet of paper. $E$ and $F$ are points on $AB$ and $CD$ respectively such that $BE < CF$. If $BCFE$ is folded over $EF$, $C$ maps to $C'$ on $AD$ and $B$ maps to $B'$ such that $\angle{AB'C'} \cong \angle{B'EA}$. If $AB' = 5$ and $BE = 23$, then the area of $ABCD$ can be expressed as $a + b\sqrt{c}$ square units, where $a, b,$ and $c$ are integers and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Compute $a + b + c$.
