Reasoning: So i need to find the remainder when the sum of this sequence 
1
+
7
+
13
+
19
+
⋯
+
253
+
259
1+7+13+19+⋯+253+259 is divided by 6. hmm, first, i should understand what kind of sequence this is. it looks like an arithmetic sequence because the difference between consecutive terms is constant.

let me check the difference between the terms: 7 - 1 = 6, 13 - 7 = 6, 19 - 13 = 6, and so on. yeah, it's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6.

now, to find the sum of an arithmetic sequence, i can use the formula:

s
=
n
2
×
(
a
1
+
a
n
)
s= 
2
n
​
 ×(a 
1
​
 +a 
n
​
 )
where:

- 
s
s is the sum of the sequence,

- 
n
n is the number of terms,

- 
a
1
a 
1
​
  is the first term,

- 
a
n
a 
n
​
  is the last term.

i know 
a
1
=
1
a 
1
​
 =1 and 
a
n
=
259
a 
n
​
 =259, but i need to find 
n
n, the number of terms.

to find 
n
n, i can use the formula for the 
n
n-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

a
n
=
a
1
+
(
n
−
1
)
×
d
a 
n
​
 =a 
1
​
 +(n−1)×d
where 
d
d is the common difference. here, 
d
=
6
d=6.

so,

259
=
1
+
(
n
−
1
)
×
6
259=1+(n−1)×6
let me solve for 
n
n:

259
−
1
=
(
n
−

)
×
6
258
=
(
n
−

)
×

n
−

=
258
6
n
−

=
43
n
=
44
259−1=(n−1)×6
258=(n−1)×6
n−1= 
6
258
​
 
n−1=43
n=44
so, there are 44 terms in this sequence.

now, plugging back into the sum formula:

s
=
44
2
×
(
1
+
259
)
=
22
×
260
=
5720
s= 
2
44
​
 ×(1+259)=22×260=5720
alright, so the sum of the sequence is 5720. now, i need to find the remainder when 5720 is divided by 6.

to find the remainder, i can perform the division:

5720
÷
6
5720÷6
but that might be time-consuming. i recall that there's a quicker way to find the remainder of a number divided by 6. since 6 is 2 times 3, and 2 and 3 are co-prime, i can check the divisibility rules for 2 and 3.

first, check if 5720 is divisible by 2: yes, because it's even.

then, check if it's divisible by 3: sum of the digits of 5720 is 5 + 7 + 2 + 0 = 14, and 14 is not divisible by 3, so 5720 is not divisible by 6.

but i need the remainder, not just whether it's divisible.

alternatively, i can use modular arithmetic to find 
5720
m
o
d
 
 
6
5720mod6.

let me recall that for any integer 
a
a, 
a
m
o
d
 
 
6
amod6 is the remainder when 
a
a is divided by 6.

i can also use the property that 
(
a
+
b
)
m
o
d
 
 
6
=
[
(
a
m
o
d
 
 
6
)
+
(
b
m
o
d
 
 
6
)
]
m
o
d
 
 
6
(a+b)mod6=[(amod6)+(bmod6)]mod6.

but since 5720 is a sum of the sequence, maybe there's a smarter way to find the remainder without calculating the entire sum.

wait, perhaps i can find the remainder of each term in the sequence when divided by 6 and then sum those remainders, and finally take the sum modulo 6.

that might be a better approach because it avoids dealing with large numbers.

so, let's try that.

first, find the remainder of each term in the sequence when divided by 6.

the sequence is: 1, 7, 13, 19, ..., 253, 259.

let's find the pattern of remainders.

calculate 
1
m
o
d
 
 
6
=
1
1mod6=1

7
m
o
d
 
 
6
=
1
7mod6=1 (since 7 - 6 = 1)

13
m
o
d
 
 
6
=
1
13mod6=1 (13 - 12 = 1)

wait, is that right? let me check:

actually, 7 divided by 6 is 1 with a remainder of 1.

13 divided by 6 is 2 with a remainder of 1.

19 divided by 6 is 3 with a remainder of 1.

wait a minute, all these terms have a remainder of 1 when divided by 6?

let me check a few more terms to confirm.

25 divided by 6 is 4 with a remainder of 1.

31 divided by 6 is 5 with a remainder of 1.

yes, it seems like every term in this sequence has a remainder of 1 when divided by 6.

so, if there are 44 terms, and each term has a remainder of 1 when divided by 6, then the sum of the remainders is 44 times 1, which is 44.

now, to find the remainder of this sum when divided by 6, i need to calculate 
44
m
o
d
 
 
6
44mod6.

what's 44 divided by 6?

6 times 7 is 42, and 44 - 42 = 2.

so, the remainder is 2.

therefore, the remainder when the sum of the sequence is divided by 6 is 2.

wait a second, but earlier i calculated the sum as 5720 and thought about dividing it by 6, but then i took a different approach and got 2 as the remainder.

let me double-check my initial approach.

if the sum is 5720, and i divide it by 6, what is the remainder?

well, 6 times 953 is 5718, and 5720 - 5718 = 2.

yes, the remainder is indeed 2.

so, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.

alternatively, i could have noticed that since each term leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 6, and there are 44 terms, the total sum leaves a remainder of 44 times 1, which is 44, and 44 divided by 6 leaves a remainder of 2.

this seems consistent.

is there another way to approach this problem?

maybe i can consider properties of arithmetic sequences modulo 6.

given that the sequence is arithmetic with a common difference of 6, which is divisible by 6, each term is congruent to the previous term modulo 6.

wait, since the common difference is 6, which is 0 modulo 6, then all terms are congruent to the first term modulo 6.

since the first term is 1, all terms are congruent to 1 modulo 6.

therefore, each term is ≡ 1 mod 6.

hence, the sum of 44 terms is 44 × 1 = 44, and 44 mod 6 is 2.

this aligns with my previous calculations.

i think this confirms that the remainder is 2.

so, the final answer should be \boxed{2}.
