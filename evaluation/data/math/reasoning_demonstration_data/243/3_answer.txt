Answer: To find the remainder when the sum of the sequence \(1 + 7 + 13 + 19 + \cdots + 253 + 259\) is divided by 6, we first recognize that it is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6.

the first term \(a_1 = 1\) and the last term \(a_n = 259\). to find the number of terms \(n\), we use the formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

\[
a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) \times d
\]

where \(d = 6\). solving for \(n\):

\[
259 = 1 + (n - 1) \times 6 \\
258 = (n - 1) \times 6 \\
n - 1 = \frac{258}{6} \\
n - 1 = 43 \\
n = 44
\]

the sum of the sequence is:

\[
s = \frac{n}{2} \times (a_1 + a_n) = \frac{44}{2} \times (1 + 259) = 22 \times 260 = 5720
\]

next, we find the remainder of 5720 when divided by 6. each term in the sequence leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. therefore, the sum of the remainders of 44 terms is:

\[
44 \times 1 = 44
\]

finally, we find the remainder of 44 when divided by 6:

\[
44 \div 6 = 7 \text{ remainder } 2
\]

thus, the remainder when the sum of the sequence is divided by 6 is \(\boxed{2}\).
