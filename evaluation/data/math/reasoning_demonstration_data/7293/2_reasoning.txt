Reasoning: So i have this problem: find the minimum value of the quadratic function 
5
x
2
−
20
x
+
1357
5x 
2
 −20x+1357. hmm, i've seen quadratic functions before, and i know they graph as parabolas. since the coefficient of 
x
2
x 
2
  is positive (5), the parabola opens upwards, which means it has a minimum point at its vertex. so, to find the minimum value, i need to find the vertex of this parabola.

i remember there are a couple of ways to find the vertex of a quadratic function. one way is to use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex, which is 
x
=
−
b
2
a
x=− 
2a
b
​	
 , where the quadratic is in the form 
a
x
2
+
b
x
+
c
ax 
2
 +bx+c. another way is to complete the square, which can also give me the vertex form of the quadratic.

let me try the first method. in the given quadratic, 
a
=
5
a=5, 
b
=
−
20
b=−20, and 
c
=
1357
c=1357. plugging into the formula:

x
=
−
−
20
2
×
5
=
20
10
=
2
x=− 
2×5
−20
​	
 = 
10
20
​	
 =2
so, the x-coordinate of the vertex is 2. now, to find the minimum value, i need to plug this back into the original equation to find the corresponding y-value.

y
=
5
(
2
)
2

20
(

)

1357
=

(

1357
=

−
40
+
1357
=
−
20
+
1357
=
1337
y=5(2) 
2
 −20(2)+1357=5(4)−40+1357=20−40+1357=−20+1357=1337
so, the minimum value of the function is 1337.

wait a second, just to make sure i did this right, let me try completing the square for the same quadratic.

starting with 
5
x
2
−
20
x
+
1357
5x 
2
 −20x+1357, i can factor out the coefficient of 
x
2
x 
2
  from the first two terms:

5
(
x
2
−
4
x
)
+
1357
5(x 
2
 −4x)+1357
now, to complete the square inside the parentheses, i take half of the coefficient of x, which is -4, so half of that is -2, and then square it to get 4.

5
(
x
2
−
4
x
+
4
−
4
)
+
1357
=
5
(
(
x
−
2
)
2
−
4
)
+
1357
5(x 
2
 −4x+4−4)+1357=5((x−2) 
2
 −4)+1357
distribute the 5:

5
(
x
−
2
)
2
−
20
+
1357
5(x−2) 
2
 −20+1357
combine the constants:

5
(
x
−
2
)
2
+
1337
5(x−2) 
2
 +1337
so, the vertex form is 
5
(
x
−
2
)
2
+
1337
5(x−2) 
2
 +1337, and since the squared term is always non-negative and multiplied by 5, the smallest it can be is 0, which occurs when 
x
=
2
x=2. therefore, the minimum value of the function is indeed 1337.

just to double-check, maybe i can graph this function or think about its behavior. as x increases or decreases from 2, the 
(
x
−
2
)
2
(x−2) 
2
  term increases, making the entire expression larger. so, yes, the minimum should be at x = 2, and the value there is 1337.

i think i'm confident with this answer now.

**final answer**

1337
