Answer: Given the product of two consecutive page numbers is \( 18,360 \), we need to find their sum.

let the two consecutive page numbers be \( n \) and \( n + 1 \). therefore, we have:

\[
n(n + 1) = 18,360
\]

expanding and rearranging the equation:

\[
n^2 + n - 18,360 = 0
\]

this is a quadratic equation in the form \( an^2 + bn + c = 0 \) with \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = -18,360 \). using the quadratic formula:

\[
n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

substituting the values:

\[
n = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4 \cdot 18,360}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{73,441}}{2}
\]

since \( \sqrt{73,441} = 271 \):

\[
n = \frac{-1 \pm 271}{2}
\]

this gives two possible solutions:

\[
n = \frac{-1 + 271}{2} = 135 \quad \text{or} \quad n = \frac{-1 - 271}{2} = -136
\]

since page numbers cannot be negative, we have \( n = 135 \). therefore, the two consecutive page numbers are 135 and 136. their sum is:

\[
135 + 136 = 271
\]

thus, the sum of the two page numbers is:

\[
\boxed{271}
\]
