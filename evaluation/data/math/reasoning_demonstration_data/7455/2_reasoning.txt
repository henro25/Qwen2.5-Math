Reasoning: So i have this problem here: "the product of two consecutive page numbers is 18,360. what is the sum of the two page numbers?" okay, let's see how to approach this.

first, i need to understand what "two consecutive page numbers" means. if i think about a book, the pages are numbered sequentially, like 100 and 101, or 150 and 151. so, if i call the first page number "n," then the next one would be "n + 1." got it.

so, the product of these two pages is n times (n + 1), and that's equal to 18,360. so, i can write that as:

n(n + 1) = 18,360

my goal is to find the sum of these two page numbers, which would be n + (n + 1) = 2n + 1.

but before i can find the sum, i need to find the value of n first. so, let's work on solving for n.

starting with the equation:

n(n + 1) = 18,360

if i expand the left side, it becomes:

n² + n = 18,360

now, this looks like a quadratic equation. to solve for n, i can set it to zero:

n² + n - 18,360 = 0

alright, now i have a quadratic equation in the form of an² + bn + c = 0, where a = 1, b = 1, and c = -18,360.

i can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

n = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

plugging in the values:

n = [-1 ± √(1² - 4*1*(-18,360))] / (2*1)

simplify inside the square root:

n = [-1 ± √(1 + 73,440)] / 2

n = [-1 ± √73,441] / 2

now, i need to find the square root of 73,441. hmm, i don't know that off the top of my head, but maybe i can estimate it.

i know that 270 squared is 72,900 because 270*270 = 72,900.

and 271 squared is 271*271. let's calculate that:

271*271:

270*270 = 72,900

270*1 = 270

1*270 = 270

1*1 = 1

so, 72,900 + 270 + 270 + 1 = 73,441

oh, that's perfect! so, √73,441 = 271

therefore, n = [-1 ± 271] / 2

now, i have two possible solutions:

n = (-1 + 271) / 2 = 270 / 2 = 135

or

n = (-1 - 271) / 2 = -272 / 2 = -136

but page numbers can't be negative, so n = 135.

therefore, the two consecutive page numbers are 135 and 136.

now, the sum of these two numbers is 135 + 136 = 271.

wait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my work to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

first, i set up the equation correctly: n(n + 1) = 18,360.

expanding gives n² + n - 18,360 = 0.

using the quadratic formula, n = [-1 ± √(1 + 4*18,360)] / 2

wait, in the quadratic formula, it should be b² - 4ac, which in this case is 1² - 4*1*(-18,360) = 1 + 73,440 = 73,441.

and the square root of 73,441 is indeed 271, as i calculated earlier.

so, n = (-1 ± 271)/2.

discarding the negative solution, n = 135.

therefore, the two consecutive page numbers are 135 and 136, and their sum is 271.

just to be extra sure, let me check the product:

135 * 136 = ?

135 * 100 = 13,500

135 * 30 = 4,050

135 * 6 = 810

adding them up: 13,500 + 4,050 = 17,550 + 810 = 18,360

yes, that matches the given product.

so, the sum of the two page numbers is indeed 271.

alternatively, i could have approached this problem by estimating the square root of 18,360, since n(n + 1) is approximately n² when n is large.

so, n² is approximately 18,360.

then, n is approximately √18,360.

let's calculate that.

√16,000 = 126.491, but wait, actually, √16,000 is 126.491? wait, no, that's not right.

wait, √16,000 = √(16 * 1,000) = 4 * √1,000 ≈ 4 * 31.622 ≈ 126.488.

but that seems low compared to earlier calculations.

wait, but in my earlier calculation, n was 135, which squared is 18,225, and 135*136=18,360.

so, maybe estimating √18,360.

wait, 135 squared is 18,225.

136 squared is 18,496.

so, √18,360 is between 135 and 136, which makes sense.

but since n(n + 1) is 18,360, and n is 135, that checks out.

alternatively, if i consider that the sum of two consecutive numbers is always odd because one is even and one is odd, and their sum is 2n + 1.

in this case, 2n + 1 = 271, which is indeed odd.

so, that also makes sense.

i think i've covered all the bases here, and my answer seems correct.

**final answer**

271
