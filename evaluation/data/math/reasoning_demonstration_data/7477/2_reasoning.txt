Reasoning: So i have this problem: "what is the slope of a line parallel to the line 
2
x
−
4
y
=
9
2x−4y=9? express your answer as a common fraction." alright, let's break this down. i need to find the slope of a line that's parallel to the given line. i know that parallel lines have the same slope, so if i can find the slope of the given line, that will be the answer.

first, i should probably get the equation of the line into a form where i can easily identify the slope. the standard form of a linear equation is 
y
=
m
x
+
b
y=mx+b, where 
m
m is the slope and 
b
b is the y-intercept. so, i need to solve for 
y
y in terms of 
x
x in the equation 
2
x
−
4
y
=
9
2x−4y=9.

let me try that. starting with:

2
x
−
4
y
=
9
2x−4y=9
i want to isolate 
y
y, so i'll first subtract 
2
x
2x from both sides:

−
4
y
=
−
2
x
+
9
−4y=−2x+9
now, i need to get rid of the coefficient 
−
4
−4 in front of 
y
y. i'll divide every term by 
−
4
−4:

y
=
−
2
x
+
9
−
4
y= 
−4
−2x+9
​	
 
simplifying that, i can split the fraction:

y
=
−
2
x
−
4
+
9
−
4
y= 
−4
−2x
​	
 + 
−4
9
​	
 
the negatives in the numerator and denominator of the first term cancel out:

y
=
1
2
x
−
9
4
y= 
2
1
​	
 x− 
4
9
​	
 
so, the equation is now in the form 
y
=
m
x
+
b
y=mx+b, where 
m
=
1
2
m= 
2
1
​	
  and 
b
=
−
9
4
b=− 
4
9
​	
 . therefore, the slope of the original line is 
1
2
2
1
​	
 .

since parallel lines have identical slopes, any line parallel to the given line will also have a slope of 
1
2
2
1
​	
 .

wait a minute, let me double-check my steps to make sure i didn't make any mistakes. starting from:

2
x
−
4
y
=
9
2x−4y=9
subtracting 
2
x
2x from both sides:

−
4
y
=
−
2
x
+
9
−4y=−2x+9
dividing by 
−
4
−4:

y
=
−
2
x
+
9
−
4
=
1
2
x
−
9
4
y= 
−4
−2x+9
​	
 = 
2
1
​	
 x− 
4
9
​	
 
yes, that looks correct. the slope is indeed 
1
2
2
1
​	
 .

alternatively, i could use the general form of a linear equation, 
a
x
+
b
y
+
c
=
0
ax+by+c=0, and recall that the slope 
m
m is 
−
a
b
− 
b
a
​	
 . in this equation, 
a
=
2
a=2 and 
b
=
−
4
b=−4, so:

m
=
−
2
−
4
=
2
4
=
1
2
m=− 
−4
2
​	
 = 
4
2
​	
 = 
2
1
​	
 
again, i get the same result, which is reassuring.

i think i've got it. the slope of any line parallel to 
2
x
−
4
y
=
9
2x−4y=9 is 
1
2
2
1
​	
 .
