Answer: To find the slope of a line parallel to the line \(2x - 4y = 9\), we need to determine the slope of the given line. 

starting with the equation:
\[2x - 4y = 9\]

we isolate \(y\) by first subtracting \(2x\) from both sides:
\[-4y = -2x + 9\]

next, we divide every term by \(-4\):
\[y = \frac{-2x + 9}{-4}\]

simplifying the fraction:
\[y = \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{9}{4}\]

the equation is now in the form \(y = mx + b\), where \(m\) is the slope. thus, the slope \(m\) is:
\[m = \frac{1}{2}\]

since parallel lines have the same slope, the slope of any line parallel to the given line is:
\[\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\]
