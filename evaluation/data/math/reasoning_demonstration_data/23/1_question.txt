Problem: The vertices $V$ of a centrally symmetric hexagon in the complex plane are given by \[V=\left\{   \sqrt{2}i,-\sqrt{2}i, \frac{1}{\sqrt{8}}(1+i),\frac{1}{\sqrt{8}}(-1+i),\frac{1}{\sqrt{8}}(1-i),\frac{1}{\sqrt{8}}(-1-i) \right\}.\]For each $j$, $1\leq j\leq 12$, an element $z_j$ is chosen from $V$ at random, independently of the other choices. Let $P={\prod}_{j=1}^{12}z_j$ be the product of the $12$ numbers selected.

The probability that $P=-1$ can be expressed in the form
\[\frac{a}{p^b},\]where $a,$ $b,$ $p$ are positive integers, $p$ is prime, and $a$ is not divisible by $p.$  Find $a + b + p.$
