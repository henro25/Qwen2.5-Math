Reasoning: So i've got this problem here. it involves complex numbers and probability, which i think i can handle, but i need to take it step by step.

first, there's a set of vertices 
v
v of a centrally symmetric hexagon in the complex plane, given by:

v
=
{
2
i
,
−
2
i
,
1
8
(
1
+
i
)
,
1
8
(
−
1
+
i
)
,
1
8
(
1
−
i
)
,
1
8
(
−
1
−
i
)
}
v={ 
2
​
 i,− 
2
​
 i, 
8
​
 
1
​
 (1+i), 
8
​
 
1
​
 (−1+i), 
8
​
 
1
​
 (1−i), 
8
​
 
1
​
 (−1−i)}
i need to choose 12 elements 
z
j
z 
j
​
  from 
v
v independently and find the probability that their product 
p
=
∏
j
=
1
12
z
j
p=∏ 
j=1
12
​
 z 
j
​
  equals -1.

the probability should be expressed in the form 
a
p
b
p 
b
 
a
​
 , where 
p
p is a prime, and 
a
a is not divisible by 
p
p. then, i need to find 
a
+
b
+
p
a+b+p.

alright, to approach this, i think i need to understand the properties of these complex numbers in 
v
v, especially their magnitudes and arguments, because when you multiply complex numbers, their magnitudes multiply and their arguments add.

first, let's find the magnitudes of each element in 
v
v:

1. 
∣
2
i
∣
=
2
∣ 
2
​
 i∣= 
2
​
 

2. 
∣
−
2
i
∣
=
2
∣− 
2
​
 i∣= 
2
​
 

3. 
∣
1
8
(
1
+
i
)
∣
=
1
8
⋅
1
2
+
1
2
=
1
8
⋅
2
=
1
2
​
  
8
​
 
1
​
 (1+i) 
​
 = 
8
​
 
1
​
 ⋅ 
1 
2
 +1 
2
 
​
 = 
8
​
 
1
​
 ⋅ 
2
​
 = 
2
1
​
 

4. similarly, the magnitudes of the other four elements are also 
1
2
2
1
​
 , since they're similar to the third one but with different signs.

so, magnitudes are either 
2
2
​
  or 
1
2
2
1
​
 .

now, the magnitude of the product 
p
p would be the product of the magnitudes of the individual 
z
j
z 
j
​
 's.

since 
p
=
−
1
p=−1, and 
∣
−
1
∣
=
1
∣−1∣=1, the product of the magnitudes must be 1.

let’s denote the number of times 
2
i
2
​
 i or 
−
2
i
− 
2
​
 i is chosen as 
k
k, and the number of times one of the four elements with magnitude 
1
2
2
1
​
  is chosen as 
12
−
k
12−k.

so, the magnitude condition is:

(
2
)
k
×
(
1
2
)
12
−
k
=
1
( 
2
​
 ) 
k
 ×( 
2
1
​
 ) 
12−k
 =1
let’s solve for 
k
k:

(
2
)
k
×
(
1
2
)
12
−
k
=
1
( 
2
​
 ) 
k
 ×( 
2
1
​
 ) 
12−k
 =1
note that 
2
=
2
1
/
2
2
​
 =2 
1/2
 , so:

2
k
/
2
×
2
−
(
12
−
k
)
=
1
  
⟹
  
2
k
/
2
−
12
+
k
=
1
  
⟹
  
2
(
3
k
/
2
)
−
12
=
1
2 
k/2
 ×2 
−(12−k)
 =1⟹2 
k/2−12+k
 =1⟹2 
(3k/2)−12
 =1
since 
2
0
=
1
2 
0
 =1, we have:

3
k
2
−
12
=
0
  
⟹
  
3
k
2
=
12
  
⟹
  
k
=
8
2
3k
​
 −12=0⟹ 
2
3k
​
 =12⟹k=8
so, exactly 8 of the 12 choices must be 
2
i
2
​
 i or 
−
2
i
− 
2
​
 i, and the remaining 4 must be one of the four elements with magnitude 
1
2
2
1
​
 .

now, let's consider the arguments. the product 
p
p should equal -1, which has an argument of 
π
π (since -1 lies on the real axis at an angle of 
π
π radians).

the argument of the product 
p
p is the sum of the arguments of the individual 
z
j
z 
j
​
 's, modulo 
2
π
2π.

so, we need:

∑
j
=
1
12
arg
⁡
(
z
j
)
≡
π
(
m
o
d
2
π
)
j=1
∑
12
​
 arg(z 
j
​
 )≡π(mod2π)
let's find the arguments of each element in 
v
v:

1. 
2
i
2
​
 i: this is purely imaginary and positive imaginary, so its argument is 
π
2
2
π
​
 .

2. 
−
2
i
− 
2
​
 i: purely imaginary but negative, so its argument is 
−
π
2
− 
2
π
​
  or equivalently 
3
π
2
2
3π
​
 .

3. 
1
8
(
1
+
i
)
8
​
 
1
​
 (1+i): this is in the first quadrant. the argument is 
π
4
4
π
​
 .

4. 
1
8
(
−
1
+
i
)
8
​
 
1
​
 (−1+i): second quadrant, argument 
3
π
4
4
3π
​
 .

5. 
1
8
(
1
−
i
)
8
​
 
1
​
 (1−i): fourth quadrant, argument 
−
π
4
− 
4
π
​
  or 
7
π
4
4
7π
​
 .

6. 
1
8
(
−
1
−
i
)
8
​
 
1
​
 (−1−i): third quadrant, argument 
−
3
π
4
− 
4
3π
​
  or 
5
π
4
4
5π
​
 .

now, since we have 12 choices, 8 of them are either 
π
2
2
π
​
  or 
3
π
2
2
3π
​
 , and 4 of them are 
π
4
4
π
​
 , 
3
π
4
4
3π
​
 , 
7
π
4
4
7π
​
 , or 
5
π
4
4
5π
​
 .

our goal is to have the sum of these arguments equal to 
π
π modulo 
2
π
2π.

this seems a bit tricky. maybe there's a better way to approach this.

alternatively, since the hexagon is centrally symmetric, maybe there's some property i can use about pairing elements.

wait, since it's centrally symmetric, for every 
z
z in 
v
v, 
−
z
−z is also in 
v
v. that might be useful.

also, since we're dealing with products, maybe considering the multiplicative properties or exponents in polar form could help.

let me think about expressing each 
z
j
z 
j
​
  in polar form.

each complex number 
z
z can be written as 
z
=
r
e
i
θ
z=re 
iθ
 , where 
r
r is the magnitude and 
θ
θ is the argument.

so, the product 
p
=
∏
j
=
1
12
z
j
=
∏
j
=
1
12
r
j
e
i
θ
j
=
(
∏
j
=
1
12
r
j
)
e
i
∑
j
=
1
12
θ
j
p=∏ 
j=1
12
​
 z 
j
​
 =∏ 
j=1
12
​
 r 
j
​
 e 
iθ 
j
​
 
 =(∏ 
j=1
12
​
 r 
j
​
 )e 
i∑ 
j=1
12
​
 θ 
j
​
 
 

we already have the condition on the magnitudes, which led us to 
k
=
8
k=8, meaning 8 choices have magnitude 
2
2
​
 , and 4 have magnitude 
1
2
2
1
​
 , ensuring that the product magnitude is 1.

now, for the argument, we need 
∑
j
=
1
12
θ
j
≡
π
(
m
o
d
2
π
)
∑ 
j=1
12
​
 θ 
j
​
 ≡π(mod2π).

given that, and knowing the possible 
θ
j
θ 
j
​
  values, perhaps i can find the number of ways to choose the arguments such that their sum is 
π
π modulo 
2
π
2π.

this seems complicated. maybe there's a smarter way.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the exponents in terms of roots of unity or something similar.

wait, maybe if i consider the logarithm of the product, but that might not simplify things.

let me try to think about the multiplicative group structure.

each 
z
j
z 
j
​
  can be seen as an element of the multiplicative group of non-zero complex numbers, but that's too broad. maybe considering their arguments modulo 
2
π
2π.

alternatively, perhaps it's better to look at the exponents in terms of their angles in multiples of 
π
/
4
π/4, since all the arguments are multiples of 
π
/
4
π/4.

looking back, the arguments are:

- 
π
2
=
2
π
4
2
π
​
 = 
4
2π
​
 

- 
3
π
2
=
6
π
4
2
3π
​
 = 
4
6π
​
 

- 
π
4
=
1
π
4
4
π
​
 = 
4
1π
​
 

- 
3
π
4
=
3
π
4
4
3π
​
 = 
4
3π
​
 

- 
7
π
4
=
7
π
4
4
7π
​
 = 
4
7π
​
 

- 
5
π
4
=
5
π
4
4
5π
​
 = 
4
5π
​
 

so, all arguments are integer multiples of 
π
/
4
π/4, specifically 
0
,
π
/
4
,
π
/
2
,
3
π
/
4
,
π
,
5
π
/
4
,
3
π
/
2
,
7
π
/
4
0,π/4,π/2,3π/4,π,5π/4,3π/2,7π/4, but in our case, only specific ones are present.

given that, perhaps it's easier to work in terms of multiples of 
π
/
4
π/4, treating the arguments as integers modulo 8, since 
2
π
2π corresponds to 8 times 
π
/
4
π/4.

let’s define 
θ
j
θ 
j
​
  in units of 
π
/
4
π/4, so:

- 
π
2
=
2
2
π
​
 =2

- 
3
π
2
=
6
2
3π
​
 =6

- 
π
4
=
1
4
π
​
 =1

- 
3
π
4
=
3
4
3π
​
 =3

- 
7
π
4
=
7
4
7π
​
 =7

- 
5
π
4
=
5
4
5π
​
 =5

and we need the sum of these 
θ
j
θ 
j
​
  (in units of 
π
/
4
π/4) to be congruent to 
π
π, which is 4 units (since 
π
=
4
×
π
/
4
π=4×π/4), modulo 8.

so, we have:

∑
j
=
1
12
θ
j
≡
4
(
m
o
d
8
)
j=1
∑
12
​
 θ 
j
​
 ≡4(mod8)
now, i need to find the number of ways to choose 12 elements from 
v
v, with exactly 8 of them being either 2 or 6, and the remaining 4 being 1, 3, 5, or 7, such that the sum of their corresponding 
θ
j
θ 
j
​
  values is congruent to 4 modulo 8.

this seems more manageable.

first, let's find out how many choices there are in total for the 12 selections, given the constraints on magnitudes.

we have to choose 8 elements from the two with magnitude 
2
2
​
 , which are 2 and 6, and 4 elements from the four with magnitude 
1
2
2
1
​
 , which are 1, 3, 5, 7.

so, the total number of possible choices is:

total
=
2
8
×
4
4
total=2 
8
 ×4 
4
 
because for each of the 8 positions with magnitude 
2
2
​
 , there are 2 choices (2 or 6), and for each of the 4 positions with magnitude 
1
2
2
1
​
 , there are 4 choices (1, 3, 5, 7).

now, among these, we need to count how many have the sum of their 
θ
j
θ 
j
​
  congruent to 4 modulo 8.

this is essentially counting the number of sequences where 8 positions have either 2 or 6, and 4 positions have 1, 3, 5, or 7, and the total sum is 4 modulo 8.

this seems like a problem that can be approached using generating functions or perhaps combinatorial counting with modular arithmetic.

let me try to set up the generating function for the sum of the arguments.

each of the 8 positions with magnitude 
2
2
​
  contributes either 2 or 6, and each of the 4 positions with magnitude 
1
2
2
1
​
  contributes 1, 3, 5, or 7.

we need the sum of these contributions to be 4 modulo 8.

let’s denote the sum from the first group as 
s
1
s 
1
​
 , and from the second group as 
s
2
s 
2
​
 . we have:

s
1
+
s
2
≡
4
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
1
​
 +s 
2
​
 ≡4(mod8)
where 
s
1
s 
1
​
  is the sum of 8 terms, each being 2 or 6, and 
s
2
s 
2
​
  is the sum of 4 terms, each being 1, 3, 5, or 7.

first, let's find the possible values of 
s
1
s 
1
​
  modulo 8.

each term in 
s
1
s 
1
​
  is either 2 or 6, which are equivalent to 2 and 6 modulo 8.

so, for 8 such terms, the sum 
s
1
s 
1
​
  can range from 
8
×
2
=
16
8×2=16 to 
8
×
6
=
48
8×6=48, but we care about 
s
1
m
o
d
 
 
8
s 
1
​
 mod8.

note that 2 mod 8 is 2, and 6 mod 8 is 6.

the sum of eight terms, each being 2 or 6, can be expressed as:

s
1
=
2
a
+
6
(
8
−
a
)
=
2
a
+
48
−
6
a
=

−
4
a
s

​
 =2a+6(8−a)=2a+48−6a=48−4a
where 
a
a is the number of times 2 is chosen, and 
8
−
a
8−a is the number of times 6 is chosen, with 
0
≤
a
≤
8
0≤a≤8.

then, 
s

m
o
d
 
 
8
s

​
 mod8 is:

48
−
4
a
≡

≡
4
(

)
(
m

)
48−4a≡0−4a≡−4a≡4(−a)(mod8)
but since 
−
a
≡
8
−
a
(
m
o
d
8
)
−a≡8−a(mod8), we have:

s
1
≡

(
8

)
≡
32
−
4
a

s

​
 ≡4(8−a)≡32−4a≡0−4a≡−4a≡4(−a)(mod8)
this seems a bit convoluted. maybe there's a better way to find 
s
1
m
o
d
 
 
8
s 
1
​
 mod8.

alternatively, since each 2 contributes 2 and each 6 contributes 6, which is equivalent to -2 modulo 8, because 6 - 8 = -2.

so, each 6 can be seen as -2 modulo 8.

therefore, 
s
1
≡
2
a
−
2
(
8

a
)
=
2
a

)
s 
1
​
 ≡2a−2(8−a)=2a−16+2a=4a−16≡4a−0≡4a(mod8), since -16 ≡ 0 mod 8.

so, 
s
1
≡
4
a
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
1
​
 ≡4a(mod8), where 
a
a is the number of times 2 is chosen among the 8 selections.

now, for 
s
2
s 
2
​
 , which is the sum of 4 terms, each being 1, 3, 5, or 7 modulo 8.

each of these is odd, and they are all distinct modulo 8.

let’s consider the possible sums of four such numbers.

each term can be 1, 3, 5, or 7 mod 8.

let’s denote the four choices as 1, 3, 5, 7.

the sum of four such numbers can be from 4 (1+1+1+1) to 28 (7+7+7+7), but we care about the sum modulo 8.

first, note that 1 mod 8 is 1, 3 is 3, 5 is 5, and 7 is 7.

so, 
s
2
s 
2
​
  can be any integer between 4 and 28, but we need 
s
2
m
o
d
 
 
8
s 
2
​
 mod8.

let’s find all possible values of 
s
2
m
o
d
 
 
8
s 
2
​
 mod8.

each term is odd, and the sum of four odd numbers is even.

so, 
s
2
s 
2
​
  is even.

possible even residues modulo 8 are 0, 2, 4, 6.

so, 
s
2
s 
2
​
  can be 0, 2, 4, or 6 modulo 8.

now, recall that we need:

s
1
+
s
2
≡
4
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
1
​
 +s 
2
​
 ≡4(mod8)
given that 
s
1
≡
4
a
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
1
​
 ≡4a(mod8), and 
s
2
s 
2
​
  can be 0, 2, 4, or 6 modulo 8, we can set up the equation:

4
a
+
s
2
≡
4
(
m
o
d
8
)
4a+s 
2
​
 ≡4(mod8)
for each possible value of 
s
2
s 
2
​
 , we can solve for 
a
a.

let’s consider each case:

1. if 
s
2
≡
0
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡0(mod8):

4

⟹
  
4
(

⟹
  
a

⟹

)
4a≡4(mod8)⟹4(a−1)≡0(mod8)⟹a−1≡0(mod2)⟹a≡1(mod2)
so, 
a
a is odd: 1, 3, 5, 7.

2. if 
s
2
≡
2
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡2(mod8):

4
a
+
2
≡
4
(
m

d
8
)
  
⟹
  
4
a
≡
2
(
m
o
d
8
)
4a+2≡4(mod8)⟹4a≡2(mod8)
but 
4
a
4a is always a multiple of 4, and 2 is not a multiple of 4, so no solution here.

3. if 
s
2
≡
4
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡4(mod8):

4
a
+
4
≡
4
(
m
o
d
8
)
  
⟹
  
4
a
≡
0
(
m
o
d
8
)
  
⟹
  
a
≡
0
(
m
o
d
2
)
4a+4≡4(mod8)⟹4a≡0(mod8)⟹a≡0(mod2)
so, 
a
a is even: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.

4. if 
s
2
≡
6
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡6(mod8):

4
a

6
≡
4
(
m

)
  
⟹
  
4
a
≡
−
2
≡
6
(
m
o
d
8
)
4a+6≡4(mod8)⟹4a≡−2≡6(mod8)
again, 
4
a
4a is a multiple of 4, and 6 is not, so no solution here.

therefore, only when 
s
2
≡
0
s 
2
​
 ≡0 or 
4
(
m
o
d
8
)
4(mod8) do we have possible solutions, and in those cases:

- if 
s
2
≡
0
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡0(mod8), 
a
a is odd.

- if 
s
2
≡
4
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡4(mod8), 
a
a is even.

now, i need to find the number of ways to choose the 8 elements with magnitude 
2
2
​
  (choosing between 2 and 6), and the 4 elements with magnitude 
1
2
2
1
​
  (choosing between 1, 3, 5, 7), such that:

- if 
s
2
≡
0
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡0(mod8), then 
a
a is odd.

- if 
s
2
≡
4
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡4(mod8), then 
a
a is even.

this seems a bit involved. maybe i can think in terms of cases based on 
s
2
s 
2
​
 .

first, find the number of ways to choose the 4 elements for 
s
2
s 
2
​
  such that 
s
2
≡
0
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡0(mod8) or 
s
2
≡
4
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡4(mod8).

then, for each such case, count the number of ways to choose the 8 elements for 
s
1
s 
1
​
  with 
a
a odd or even accordingly.

alternatively, perhaps i can compute the total number of favorable outcomes and divide by the total number of possible choices to get the probability.

let’s try to compute the total number of favorable outcomes.

total choices: 
2
8
×
4
4
2 
8
 ×4 
4
 

favorable outcomes: those where 
s
1
+
s
2
≡
4
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
1
​
 +s 
2
​
 ≡4(mod8), with 
s
1
≡
4
a
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
1
​
 ≡4a(mod8) and 
s
2
s 
2
​
  as above.

let me consider the possible values of 
a
a and 
s
2
s 
2
​
  that satisfy 
4
a
+
s
2
≡
4
(
m
o
d
8
)
4a+s 
2
​
 ≡4(mod8).

from earlier, we have:

- if 
s
2
≡
0
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡0(mod8), then 
a
a is odd.

- if 
s
2
≡
4
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡4(mod8), then 
a
a is even.

let’s find the number of ways for each sub-case.

first, find the number of ways to choose the 4 elements for 
s
2
s 
2
​
  such that 
s
2
≡
0
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡0(mod8) or 
s
2
≡
4
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡4(mod8).

let’s consider the possible sums for 
s
2
s 
2
​
 , which is the sum of four elements chosen from {1,3,5,7} modulo 8.

this is equivalent to finding the number of 4-tuples from {1,3,5,7} whose sum is 0 or 4 modulo 8.

this seems like a problem that can be solved using generating functions.

the generating function for one element is 
x
1
+
x
3
+
x
5
+
x
7
x 
1
 +x 
3
 +x 
5
 +x 
7
 .

for four elements, it's 
(
x
+
x
3
+
x
5
+
x
7
)
4
(x+x 
3
 +x 
5
 +x 
7
 ) 
4
 .

we need the coefficients of 
x
0
x 
0
  and 
x
4
x 
4
  in this expansion, modulo 8.

but expanding this directly seems tedious. maybe there's a smarter way.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the possible sums modulo 8.

each element is odd, and their sum is even, as we saw earlier.

possible sums modulo 8: 0, 2, 4, 6.

i need sums that are 0 or 4.

let’s find the number of 4-tuples from {1,3,5,7} that sum to 0 or 4 modulo 8.

this is equivalent to finding the number of ways to choose four elements from these four options such that their sum is 0 or 4 modulo 8.

perhaps i can list all possible combinations.

but there are 
4
4
=
256
4 
4
 =256 possible 4-tuples, which is too many to list.

alternatively, maybe i can think in terms of the possible sums.

let me consider that each element is congruent to 1, 3, 5, or 7 modulo 8, which are equivalent to 1, 3, -3, and -1 modulo 8, respectively.

so, the possible contributions are 1, 3, -3, -1.

i need the sum of four such numbers to be 0 or 4 modulo 8.

let’s see what combinations can give these sums.

first, note that 4 modulo 8 is equivalent to -4 modulo 8.

so, the possible sums are 0 or 4 modulo 8.

let’s look at the possible sums:

- 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

- 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 6

- 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 7

- 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 = 10 ≡ 2

- 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 ≡ 0

- 1 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 10 ≡ 2

- 1 + 1 + 3 + 7 = 12 ≡ 4

- 1 + 1 + 5 + 5 = 12 ≡ 4

- 1 + 1 + 5 + 7 = 14 ≡ 6

- 1 + 1 + 7 + 7 = 16 ≡ 0

- 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 10 ≡ 2

- 1 + 3 + 3 + 5 = 12 ≡ 4

- 1 + 3 + 3 + 7 = 14 ≡ 6

- 1 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 14 ≡ 6

- 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 ≡ 0

- 1 + 3 + 7 + 7 = 18 ≡ 2

- 1 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 16 ≡ 0

- 1 + 5 + 5 + 7 = 18 ≡ 2

- 1 + 5 + 7 + 7 = 20 ≡ 4

- 1 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 22 ≡ 6

- 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 ≡ 4

- 3 + 3 + 3 + 5 = 14 ≡ 6

- 3 + 3 + 3 + 7 = 16 ≡ 0

- 3 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 16 ≡ 0

- 3 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 18 ≡ 2

- 3 + 3 + 7 + 7 = 20 ≡ 4

- 3 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 18 ≡ 2

- 3 + 5 + 5 + 7 = 20 ≡ 4

- 3 + 5 + 7 + 7 = 22 ≡ 6

- 3 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 24 ≡ 0

- 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20 ≡ 4

- 5 + 5 + 5 + 7 = 22 ≡ 6

- 5 + 5 + 7 + 7 = 24 ≡ 0

- 5 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 26 ≡ 2

- 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 28 ≡ 4

now, looking at these sums, the ones that are ≡ 0 or 4 mod 8 are:

- 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 ≡ 0

- 1 + 1 + 7 + 7 = 16 ≡ 0

- 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 ≡ 0

- 1 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 22 ≡ 6 (not)

- 3 + 3 + 3 + 7 = 16 ≡ 0

- 3 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 16 ≡ 0

- 3 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 24 ≡ 0

- 5 + 5 + 7 + 7 = 24 ≡ 0

- 5 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 26 ≡ 2 (not)

- 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 28 ≡ 4

similarly, for sums ≡ 4:

- 1 + 1 + 3 + 7 = 12 ≡ 4

- 1 + 1 + 5 + 5 = 12 ≡ 4

- 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 10 ≡ 2 (not)

- 1 + 3 + 3 + 5 = 12 ≡ 4

- 1 + 3 + 7 + 7 = 18 ≡ 2 (not)

- 1 + 5 + 7 + 7 = 20 ≡ 4

- 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 ≡ 4

- 3 + 3 + 7 + 7 = 20 ≡ 4

- 3 + 5 + 5 + 7 = 20 ≡ 4

- 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20 ≡ 4

so, counting these:

for 
s
2
≡
0
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡0(mod8):

- 1 + 1 + 3 + 3

- 1 + 1 + 7 + 7

- 1 + 3 + 5 + 7

- 3 + 3 + 3 + 7

- 3 + 3 + 5 + 5

- 3 + 7 + 7 + 7

- 5 + 5 + 7 + 7

wait, i think i missed some in the earlier list, but for the sake of time, let's assume there are, say, 10 combinations that give 
s
2
≡
0
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡0(mod8), and 10 that give 
s
2
≡
4
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡4(mod8). (this is just a placeholder; i need to find the exact number.)

actually, to be precise, let's count the exact number of 4-tuples that sum to 0 or 4 modulo 8.

from the list above, for 
s
2
≡
0
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡0(mod8), there are 7 combinations listed, but i suspect there are more considering all permutations.

wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the number of ways to get 
s
2
≡
0
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡0(mod8) or 
s
2
≡
4
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡4(mod8) is half of the total possibilities, since there are four possible residues (0,2,4,6), and assuming uniform distribution, each residue is equally likely.

but i need to verify if that's the case.

given that the choices are symmetric, and the sums are equally likely to be 0, 2, 4, or 6 modulo 8, then the number of ways to get 
s
2
≡
0
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡0(mod8) is 
4
4
4
=
4
3
=
64
4
4 
4
 
​
 =4 
3
 =64, and similarly for 
s
2
≡
4
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡4(mod8), also 64 ways.

so, total favorable for 
s
2
s 
2
​
  is 
64
+
64
=
128
64+64=128 ways.

wait, but 4^4 = 256, and there are four possible residues, so yes, each residue should have 64 ways, assuming uniform distribution.

therefore, the number of 4-tuples for 
s
2
≡
0
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡0(mod8) is 64, and for 
s
2
≡
4
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡4(mod8) is another 64, totaling 128 favorable.

now, for each of these cases:

- if 
s
2
≡
0
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡0(mod8), then 
a
a must be odd (1,3,5,7).

- if 
s
2
≡
4
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡4(mod8), then 
a
a must be even (0,2,4,6,8).

now, for the 8 choices where magnitude is 
2
2
​
 , with 2 or 6, and 
a
a is the number of times 2 is chosen.

the number of ways to choose 
a
a odd is 
∑
a
 odd
(
8
a
)
∑ 
a odd
​
 ( 
a
8
​
 ), and similarly for 
a
a even.

but wait, 
a
a is the number of times 2 is chosen, and each choice is between 2 and 6, which are both distinct in their contributions to 
s
1
s 
1
​
 .

actually, no, in terms of the sum modulo 8, as we've already considered, 
s
1
≡
4
a
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
1
​
 ≡4a(mod8), with 
a
a being the number of times 2 is chosen.

given that, the number of ways to have 
a
a odd is 
2
7
=
128
2 
7
 =128, because for 8 choices, the number of ways to choose an odd number of 2's is 
2
8
−
1
=
128
2 
8−1
 =128.

similarly, the number of ways to have 
a
a even is also 
128
128.

wait, more precisely, for a binary choice repeated 8 times, the number of ways to have an odd number of one choice is 
2
7
=
128
2 
7
 =128, and similarly for even.

so, for 
a
a odd: 128 ways.

for 
a
a even: 128 ways.

now, combining with the 
s
2
s 
2
​
  cases:

- when 
s
2
≡
0
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡0(mod8): 64 ways for 
s
2
s 
2
​
 , and 128 ways for 
a
a odd.

- when 
s
2
≡
4
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡4(mod8): 64 ways for 
s
2
s 
2
​
 , and 128 ways for 
a
a even.

therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is:

64
×
128
+
64
×
128
=
64
×
256
=
16384
64×128+64×128=64×256=16384
wait, that doesn't seem right. let me think again.

actually, for each of the 64 ways where 
s
2
≡
0
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡0(mod8), there are 128 ways for 
a
a odd.

similarly, for each of the 64 ways where 
s
2
≡
4
(
m
o
d
8
)
s 
2
​
 ≡4(mod8), there are 128 ways for 
a
a even.

so, total favorable outcomes:

64
×
128
+
64
×
128
=
64
×
256
=
16384
64×128+64×128=64×256=16384
now, the total number of possible choices is 
2
8
×
4
4
=
256
×
256
=
65536
2 
8
 ×4 
4
 =256×256=65536.

therefore, the probability is:

16384
65536
=
16384
÷
16384
65536
÷
16384
=
1
4
65536
16384
​
 = 
65536÷16384
16384÷16384
​
 = 
4
1
​
 
but wait, 16384 divided by 65536 is indeed 1/4.

however, the problem states that the probability can be expressed in the form 
a
p
b
p 
b
 
a
​
 , where 
p
p is prime, 
a
a is not divisible by 
p
p, and we need to find 
a
+
b
+
p
a+b+p.

here, 
1
4
=
1
2
2
4
1
​
 = 
2 
2
 
1
​
 , so 
a
=
1
a=1, 
p
=
2
p=2, and 
b
=
2
b=2.

therefore, 
a
+
b
+
p
=
1
+
2
+
2
=
5
a+b+p=1+2+2=5.

but i should double-check my calculations to make sure i didn't make a mistake.

first, total choices: 
2
8
×
4
4
=
256
×
256
=
65536
2 
8
 ×4 
4
 =256×256=65536.

favorable outcomes: 16384.

probability: 
16384
65536
=
1
4
65536
16384
​
 = 
4
1
​
 .

expressed as 
1
2
2
2 
2
 
1
​
 , so 
a
=
1
a=1, 
p
=
2
p=2, 
b
=
2
b=2, hence 
a
+
b
+
p
=
5
a+b+p=5.

i think that's correct.

**final answer**
