Reasoning: So i'm trying to solve this problem:

let 
f
(
x
)
=
x
3
+
x
+
1
f(x)=x 
3
 +x+1. suppose 
g
g is a cubic polynomial such that 
g
(
0
)
=
−
1
g(0)=−1, and the roots of 
g
g are the squares of the roots of 
f
f. find 
g
(
9
)
g(9).

okay, first things first, i need to understand what's being asked here. i have a cubic polynomial 
f
(
x
)
f(x), and there's another cubic polynomial 
g
(
x
)
g(x) whose roots are the squares of the roots of 
f
(
x
)
f(x). additionally, i know that 
g
(
0
)
=
−
1
g(0)=−1, and i need to find 
g
(
9
)
g(9).

let me denote the roots of 
f
(
x
)
f(x) as 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c. so, 
f
(
x
)
=
(
x
−
a
)
(
x
−
b
)
(
x
−
c
)
=
x
3
+
x
+
1
f(x)=(x−a)(x−b)(x−c)=x 
3
 +x+1. therefore, by vieta's formulas:

1. 
a
+
b
+
c
=
0
a+b+c=0 (since the coefficient of 
x
2
x 
2
  is 0)

2. 
a
b
+
b
c
+
c
a
=
1
ab+bc+ca=1

3. 
a
b
c
=
−
1
abc=−1

now, the roots of 
g
(
x
)
g(x) are 
a
2
a 
2
 , 
b
2
b 
2
 , and 
c
2
c 
2
 . so, 
g
(
x
)
=
(
x
−
a
2
)
(
x
−
b
2
)
(
x
−
c
2
)
g(x)=(x−a 
2
 )(x−b 
2
 )(x−c 
2
 ).

i need to find an expression for 
g
(
x
)
g(x), and then evaluate it at 
x
=
9
x=9, given that 
g
(
0
)
=
−
1
g(0)=−1.

first, i should find a relationship between the roots of 
g
(
x
)
g(x) and the coefficients of 
g
(
x
)
g(x). since 
g
(
x
)
g(x) is a cubic polynomial, it can be written as:

g
(
x
)
=
x
3
−
(
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
)
x
2
+
(
a
2
b
2
+
b
2
c
2
+
c
2
a
2
)
x
−
a
2
b
2
c
2
g(x)=x 
3
 −(a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 )x 
2
 +(a 
2
 b 
2
 +b 
2
 c 
2
 +c 
2
 a 
2
 )x−a 
2
 b 
2
 c 
2
 

so, i need to find expressions for 
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 , 
a
2
b
2
+
b
2
c
2
+
c
2
a
2
a 
2
 b 
2
 +b 
2
 c 
2
 +c 
2
 a 
2
 , and 
a
2
b
2
c
2
a 
2
 b 
2
 c 
2
  in terms of the coefficients of 
f
(
x
)
f(x).

first, let's find 
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 . i know that:

a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
=
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
2
−
2
(
a
b
+
b
c
+
c
a
)
a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 =(a+b+c) 
2
 −2(ab+bc+ca)

from vieta's formulas:

a
+
b
+
c
=
0
a+b+c=0, and 
a
b
+
b
c
+
c
a
=
1
ab+bc+ca=1

so,

a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
=
0
2
−
2
(
1
)
=
−
2
a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 =0 
2
 −2(1)=−2

next, 
a
2
b
2
+
b
2
c
2
+
c
2
a
2
a 
2
 b 
2
 +b 
2
 c 
2
 +c 
2
 a 
2
 . this can be written as 
(
a
b
+
b
c
+
c
a
)
2
−
2
a
b
c
(
a
+
b
+
c
)
(ab+bc+ca) 
2
 −2abc(a+b+c)

given that 
a
b
+
b
c
+
c
a
=
1
ab+bc+ca=1, 
a
b
c
=
−
1
abc=−1, and 
a
+
b
+
c
=
0
a+b+c=0, plugging in:

a
2
b
2
+
b
2
c
2
+
c
2
a
2
=
1
2
−
2
(
−
1
)
(
0
)
=
1
−
0
=
1
a 
2
 b 
2
 +b 
2
 c 
2
 +c 
2
 a 
2
 =1 
2
 −2(−1)(0)=1−0=1

finally, 
a
2
b
2
c
2
=
(
a
b
c
)
2
=
(
−
1
)
2
=
1
a 
2
 b 
2
 c 
2
 =(abc) 
2
 =(−1) 
2
 =1

so, now i can write 
g
(
x
)
g(x) as:

g
(
x
)
=
x
3
−
(
−
2
)
x
2
+
1
x
−
1
=
x
3
+
2
x
2
+
x
−
1
g(x)=x 
3
 −(−2)x 
2
 +1x−1=x 
3
 +2x 
2
 +x−1

wait a minute, but i was told that 
g
(
0
)
=
−
1
g(0)=−1. let's check what 
g
(
0
)
g(0) is with this expression.

g
(
0
)
=
0
+
0
+
0
−
1
=
−
1
g(0)=0+0+0−1=−1, which matches the given condition. great!

now, i need to find 
g
(
9
)
g(9).

so, plugging in 
x
=
9
x=9:

g
(
9
)
=
9
3
+
2
(
9
)
2
+
9
−
1
=
729
+
2
(
81
)
+
9
−
1
=
729
+
162
+
9
−
1
g(9)=9 
3
 +2(9) 
2
 +9−1=729+2(81)+9−1=729+162+9−1

let me calculate that:

729 + 162 = 891

891 + 9 = 900

900 - 1 = 899

so, 
g
(
9
)
=
899
g(9)=899

wait, but the problem says "find 
g
(
9
)
g(9)", and according to my calculation, it's 899. however, i feel like there might be a mistake somewhere because the problem seems a bit straightforward, and i might have missed something.

let me double-check my steps.

first, i found the sum of squares of roots: 
a
2
+
b
2
+
c
2
=
−
2
a 
2
 +b 
2
 +c 
2
 =−2, which seems correct.

then, 
a
2
b
2
+
b
2
c
2
+
c
2
a
2
=
1
a 
2
 b 
2
 +b 
2
 c 
2
 +c 
2
 a 
2
 =1, which also seems correct.

and 
a
2
b
2
c
2
=
1
a 
2
 b 
2
 c 
2
 =1, which is correct.

so, 
g
(
x
)
=
x
3
+
2
x
2
+
x
−
1
g(x)=x 
3
 +2x 
2
 +x−1, and 
g
(
0
)
=
−
1
g(0)=−1, which matches.

therefore, 
g
(
9
)
=
729
+
162
+
9
−
1
=
899
g(9)=729+162+9−1=899

but perhaps there's a different approach to verify this result.

alternatively, since 
g
(
x
)
g(x) has roots 
a
2
a 
2
 , 
b
2
b 
2
 , and 
c
2
c 
2
 , and 
f
(
x
)
=
x
3
+
x
+
1
f(x)=x 
3
 +x+1, maybe there's a relationship between 
g
(
x
)
g(x) and 
f
(
x
)
f(x) that i can exploit without finding the coefficients directly.

let me consider that.

if 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c are roots of 
f
(
x
)
=
0
f(x)=0, then 
a
3
+
a
+
1
=
0
a 
3
 +a+1=0, 
b
3
+
b
+
1
=
0
b 
3
 +b+1=0, and 
c
3
+
c
+
1
=
0
c 
3
 +c+1=0.

i need to find a relationship involving 
a
2
a 
2
 , 
b
2
b 
2
 , and 
c
2
c 
2
 .

maybe i can express 
a
3
a 
3
  in terms of 
a
a:

from 
a
3
+
a
+
1
=
0
a 
3
 +a+1=0, so 
a
3
=
−
a
−
1
a 
3
 =−a−1

similarly, 
b
3
=
−
b
−
1
b 
3
 =−b−1, and 
c
3
=
−
c
−
1
c 
3
 =−c−1

now, perhaps i can express higher powers of 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c in terms of lower powers.

wait, but i need to relate this to 
a
2
a 
2
 , 
b
2
b 
2
 , and 
c
2
c 
2
 .

let me think differently.

suppose 
y
=
x
2
y=x 
2
 , and since 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c are roots of 
f
(
x
)
f(x), then 
y
=
a
2
y=a 
2
 , 
y
=
b
2
y=b 
2
 , and 
y
=
c
2
y=c 
2
  are roots of 
g
(
y
)
g(y).

so, perhaps i can find an equation that relates 
y
y to 
x
x and then substitute 
x
x from 
f
(
x
)
=
0
f(x)=0.

alternatively, maybe i can find a polynomial equation that 
y
=
x
2
y=x 
2
  satisfies, given that 
x
x satisfies 
f
(
x
)
=
0
f(x)=0.

let me try that.

given 
f
(
x
)
=
x
3
+
x
+
1
=
0
f(x)=x 
3
 +x+1=0, and 
y
=
x
2
y=x 
2
 , i can try to eliminate 
x
x to find a relation purely in terms of 
y
y.

from 
y
=
x
2
y=x 
2
 , so 
x
=
y
x= 
y
​
  or 
x
=
−
y
x=− 
y
​
 , but that might not be helpful directly.

alternatively, since 
x
3
=
−
x
−
1
x 
3
 =−x−1, i can write higher powers of 
x
x in terms of lower powers.

let me see:

x
3
=
−
x
−
1
x 
3
 =−x−1

then, 
x
4
=
x
⋅
x
3
=
x
(
−
x
−
1
)
=
−
x
2
−
x
x 
4
 =x⋅x 
3
 =x(−x−1)=−x 
2
 −x

similarly, 
x
5
=
x
⋅
x
4
=
x
(
−
x
2
−
x
)
=
−
x
3
−
x
2
=
−
(
−
x
−
1
)
−
x
2
=
x
+
1
−
x
2
x 
5
 =x⋅x 
4
 =x(−x 
2
 −x)=−x 
3
 −x 
2
 =−(−x−1)−x 
2
 =x+1−x 
2
 

but i'm not sure if this is leading me anywhere.

maybe i can consider that since 
y
=
x
2
y=x 
2
 , then 
x
=
y
x= 
y
​
 , and substitute into 
f
(
x
)
=
0
f(x)=0:

(
y
)
3
+
y
+
1
=
0
( 
y
​
 ) 
3
 + 
y
​
 +1=0

which simplifies to:

y
3
/
2
+
y
1
/
2
+
1
=
0
y 
3/2
 +y 
1/2
 +1=0

this looks messy. maybe there's a better way.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the minimal polynomial of 
y
=
x
2
y=x 
2
 , given that 
x
x satisfies 
f
(
x
)
=
0
f(x)=0.

to find the minimal polynomial of 
y
y, i can express 
x
x in terms of 
y
y, and substitute into 
f
(
x
)
=
0
f(x)=0.

given 
y
=
x
2
y=x 
2
 , so 
x
=
y
x= 
y
​
 , but as before, this leads to fractional exponents, which are not ideal.

alternatively, maybe i can write 
x
3
=
−
x
−
1
x 
3
 =−x−1, and then express 
x
3
x 
3
  in terms of 
y
y:

since 
y
=
x
2
y=x 
2
 , then 
x
3
=
x
⋅
x
2
=
x
⋅
y
x 
3
 =x⋅x 
2
 =x⋅y, so 
x
⋅
y
=
−
x
−
1
x⋅y=−x−1

then, 
x
(
y
+
1
)
=
−
1
x(y+1)=−1, so 
x
=
−
1
y
+
1
x=− 
y+1
1
​
 

now, since 
y
=
x
2
y=x 
2
 , substitute 
x
x from above:

y
=
(
−
1
y
+
1
)
2
=
1
(
y
+
1
)
2
y=(− 
y+1
1
​
 ) 
2
 = 
(y+1) 
2
 
1
​
 

so, 
y
(
y
+
1
)
2
=
1
y(y+1) 
2
 =1

expanding this:

y
(
y
2
+
2
y
+
1
)
=
1
y(y 
2
 +2y+1)=1

y
3
+
2
y
2
+
y
−
1
=
0
y 
3
 +2y 
2
 +y−1=0

wait a minute, that's the same as the 
g
(
y
)
g(y) i found earlier: 
g
(
y
)
=
y
3
+
2
y
2
+
y
−
1
g(y)=y 
3
 +2y 
2
 +y−1

so, this confirms that 
g
(
y
)
=
y
3
+
2
y
2
+
y
−
1
g(y)=y 
3
 +2y 
2
 +y−1, which matches what i derived using vieta's formulas.

therefore, my earlier calculation of 
g
(
9
)
=
899
g(9)=899 should be correct.

but just to be thorough, let's see if there's another way to approach this problem, perhaps by using the fact that 
g
(
x
)
g(x) is related to 
f
(
x
)
f(x) through a transformation of variables.

alternatively, maybe i can consider that since 
g
(
x
)
g(x) has roots 
a
2
a 
2
 , 
b
2
b 
2
 , and 
c
2
c 
2
 , and 
f
(
x
)
f(x) has roots 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c, there might be a relationship between the coefficients of 
g
(
x
)
g(x) and 
f
(
x
)
f(x) that i can exploit without computing the sums of squares explicitly.

however, given that i've already confirmed my answer using two different methods—using vieta's formulas and by finding the minimal polynomial of 
y
=
x
2
y=x 
2
 —i'm confident that 
g
(
9
)
=
899
g(9)=899 is the correct answer.

so, the final answer is 
899
899
​
 .

**final answer**

899
899
