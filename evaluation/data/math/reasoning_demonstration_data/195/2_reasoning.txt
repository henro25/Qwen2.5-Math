Reasoning: Let's tackle this problem step by step. i've got the equation 
(
x
−
3
)
(
x
+
3
)
=
21
x
−
63
(x−3)(x+3)=21x−63, and i need to find the two distinct solutions, 
p
p and 
q
q, with 
p
>
q
p>q, and then determine 
p
−
q
p−q.

first off, i should probably simplify this equation to make it easier to solve. let's start by expanding the left side:

(
x
−
3
)
(
x
+
3
)
=
x
2
−
9
(x−3)(x+3)=x 
2
 −9
so now the equation looks like:

x
2
−
9
=
21
x
−
63
x 
2
 −9=21x−63
hmm, okay, now i need to get all terms on one side to set the equation to zero, which is the standard form for a quadratic equation. let's subtract 
21
x
21x and add 
63
63 to both sides:

x
2
−
21
x
−
9
+
63
=
0
x 
2
 −21x−9+63=0
simplifying that:

x
2
−
21
x
+
54
=
0
x 
2
 −21x+54=0
alright, now i have a quadratic equation in the form 
a
x
2
+
b
x
+
c
=
0
ax 
2
 +bx+c=0, where 
a
=
1
a=1, 
b
=
−
21
b=−21, and 
c
=
54
c=54.

to find the solutions to this quadratic equation, i can use the quadratic formula:

x
=
−
b
±
b
2
−
4
a
c
2
a
x= 
2a
−b± 
b 
2
 −4ac
​
 
​
 
plugging in the values:

x
=
−
(
−
21
)
±
(
−
21
)
2
−
4
(
1
)
(
54
)
2
(
1
)
=
21
±
441
−
216
2
=
21
±
225
2
x= 
2(1)
−(−21)± 
(−21) 
2
 −4(1)(54)
​
 
​
 = 
2
21± 
441−216
​
 
​
 = 
2
21± 
225
​
 
​
 
since 
225
=
15
225
​
 =15, this simplifies to:

x
=
21
±
15
2
x= 
2
21±15
​
 
so, the two solutions are:

p
=
21
+
15
2
=
36
2
=
18
p= 
2
21+15
​
 = 
2
36
​
 =18
q
=
21
−
15
2
=
6
2
=
3
q= 
2
21−15
​
 = 
2
6
​
 =3
now, since 
p
>
q
p>q, i need to find 
p
−
q
p−q:

p
−
q
=
18
−
3
=
15
p−q=18−3=15
wait a second, let's double-check to make sure i didn't make any mistakes. starting from the beginning:

1. expanded 
(
x
−
3
)
(
x
+
3
)
(x−3)(x+3) correctly to 
x
2
−
9
x 
2
 −9.

2. moved all terms to one side correctly to get 
x
2
−
21
x
+
54
=
0
x 
2
 −21x+54=0.

3. applied the quadratic formula correctly with 
a
=
1
a=1, 
b
=
−
21
b=−21, and 
c
=
54
c=54.

4. calculated the discriminant correctly: 
(
−
21
)
2
−
4
(
1
)
(
54
)
=
441
−
216
=
225
(−21) 
2
 −4(1)(54)=441−216=225, and 
225
=
15
225
​
 =15.

5. found 
p
=
18
p=18 and 
q
=
3
q=3 correctly.

6. calculated 
p
−
q
=
15
p−q=15 correctly.

everything seems to check out. i don't think i've missed anything here.

just to be thorough, let's plug these values back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it.

first, for 
x
=
18
x=18:

left side: 
(
18
−
3
)
(
18
+
3
)
=
15
×
21
=
315
(18−3)(18+3)=15×21=315

right side: 
21
(
18
)
−
63
=
378
−
63
=
315
21(18)−63=378−63=315

both sides equal 315, so 
x
=
18
x=18 is indeed a solution.

now, for 
x
=
3
x=3:

left side: 
(
3
−
3
)
(
3
+
3
)
=
0
×
6
=
0
(3−3)(3+3)=0×6=0

right side: 
21
(
3
)
−
63
=
63
−
63
=
0
21(3)−63=63−63=0

again, both sides equal 0, so 
x
=
3
x=3 is also a valid solution.

therefore, 
p
−
q
=
15
p−q=15 is the correct answer.

**final answer**

15
