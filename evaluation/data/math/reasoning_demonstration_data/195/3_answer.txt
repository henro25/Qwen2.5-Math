Answer: First, we start with the given equation:

\[
(x - 3)(x + 3) = 21x - 63
\]

expanding the left side, we get:

\[
x^2 - 9 = 21x - 63
\]

next, we move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:

\[
x^2 - 21x + 54 = 0
\]

this is a quadratic equation in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -21\), and \(c = 54\). we use the quadratic formula to find the solutions:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

plugging in the values:

\[
x = \frac{21 \pm \sqrt{441 - 216}}{2} = \frac{21 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{21 \pm 15}{2}
\]

this gives us the two solutions:

\[
p = \frac{21 + 15}{2} = 18
\]
\[
q = \frac{21 - 15}{2} = 3
\]

since \(p > q\), we find \(p - q\):

\[
p - q = 18 - 3 = 15
\]

thus, the value of \(p - q\) is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]
