Reasoning: So i have this problem here: i need to find the sum of the series 1 + 6 + 11 + 16 + 21 + 26 + ... + 91 + 96 + 101, and then find what that sum is congruent to modulo 15, meaning i need to find the remainder when that sum is divided by 15, and it has to be between 0 and 14 inclusive.

first, i should figure out what kind of series this is. it looks like an arithmetic series because each term increases by the same amount each time. let me check the differences between consecutive terms:

6 - 1 = 5

11 - 6 = 5

16 - 11 = 5

and so on... yeah, it's an arithmetic series with a common difference of 5.

in an arithmetic series, the nth term can be found using the formula:

a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d

where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the term number.

here, a_1 = 1, d = 5.

i need to find out how many terms are in this series. the last term given is 101.

so, 101 = 1 + (n - 1)*5

let's solve for n:

101 = 1 + 5(n - 1)

101 - 1 = 5(n - 1)

100 = 5(n - 1)

divide both sides by 5:

20 = n - 1

so, n = 21

there are 21 terms in this series.

now, to find the sum of an arithmetic series, the formula is:

s_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n)

where s_n is the sum of the first n terms.

plugging in the values:

s_21 = 21/2 * (1 + 101)

simplify inside the parentheses:

1 + 101 = 102

so, s_21 = 21/2 * 102

now, 21 divided by 2 is 10.5, but since we're dealing with integers, maybe there's a better way to compute this.

alternatively, 21 * 102 / 2 = 21 * 51 = ?

let's calculate 21 * 50 and 21 * 1:

21 * 50 = 1050

21 * 1 = 21

so, 1050 + 21 = 1071

therefore, the sum of the series is 1071.

now, i need to find 1071 modulo 15, which is the remainder when 1071 is divided by 15.

one way to find this is to divide 1071 by 15 and find the remainder.

alternatively, since 15 is 3 times 5, maybe i can use properties of modular arithmetic to simplify the calculation.

but perhaps the most straightforward way is to divide 1071 by 15.

let's do that.

first, find how many times 15 goes into 1071.

15 * 70 = 1050

1071 - 1050 = 21

now, 15 goes into 21 once with a remainder of 6.

because 15 * 1 = 15, and 21 - 15 = 6.

so, the remainder is 6.

therefore, 1071 ≡ 6 mod 15.

wait, but the problem is to confirm if this is correct.

alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to compute the sum modulo 15 without calculating the entire sum first.

maybe i can find each term modulo 15 and then sum those up, and then take that sum modulo 15.

let's try that.

first, find each term in the series modulo 15.

the series is: 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, ..., 101.

but since we're dealing with modulo 15, and the series has a common difference of 5, which is a factor of 15, maybe there's a pattern.

let's see:

1 mod 15 = 1

6 mod 15 = 6

11 mod 15 = 11

16 mod 15 = 1 (since 15*1=15, 16-15=1)

21 mod 15 = 6 (21-15=6)

26 mod 15 = 11 (26-15*1=11)

31 mod 15 = 1 (31-15*2=1)

36 mod 15 = 6 (36-15*2=6)

41 mod 15 = 11 (41-15*2=11)

46 mod 15 = 1 (46-15*3=1)

51 mod 15 = 6 (51-15*3=6)

56 mod 15 = 11 (56-15*3=11)

61 mod 15 = 1 (61-15*4=1)

66 mod 15 = 6 (66-15*4=6)

71 mod 15 = 11 (71-15*4=11)

76 mod 15 = 1 (76-15*5=1)

81 mod 15 = 6 (81-15*5=6)

86 mod 15 = 11 (86-15*5=11)

91 mod 15 = 1 (91-15*6=1)

96 mod 15 = 6 (96-15*6=6)

101 mod 15 = 11 (101-15*6=11)

so, the sequence of remainders is: 1, 6, 11, 1, 6, 11, 1, 6, 11, 1, 6, 11, 1, 6, 11, 1, 6, 11

wait, but earlier i thought there are 21 terms, but in this list, i have 19 terms.

wait, maybe i miscounted.

let me list them again:

1,6,11,16,21,26,31,36,41,46,51,56,61,66,71,76,81,86,91,96,101

yes, 21 terms.

their remainders modulo 15 are:

1,6,11,1,6,11,1,6,11,1,6,11,1,6,11,1,6,11,1,6,11

yes, 21 terms.

now, sum these up:

let's group them: there are 21 terms, each cycle of 1,6,11 repeats every 3 terms.

so, how many complete cycles of 1,6,11 are there in 21 terms?

21 divided by 3 is 7.

so, 7 cycles of (1 + 6 + 11)

each cycle sums to 1 + 6 + 11 = 18

then, total sum modulo 15 is 7 * 18 mod 15

first, compute 7 * 18 = 126

now, 126 mod 15.

15*8=120, 126-120=6

so, again, 6.

so, both methods give me 6.

therefore, the value of n is 6.

i think that's the answer.

**final answer**
