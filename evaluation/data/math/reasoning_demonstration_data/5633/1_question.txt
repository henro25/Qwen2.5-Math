Problem: In $\triangle{ABC}$ with $AB = 12$, $BC = 13$, and $AC = 15$, let $M$ be a point on $\overline{AC}$ such that the incircles of $\triangle{ABM}$ and $\triangle{BCM}$ have equal radii. Then $\frac{AM}{CM} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p + q$.
