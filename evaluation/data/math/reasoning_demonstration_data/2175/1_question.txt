Problem: The Happy Valley Kennel has 4 chickens, 2 dogs, and 5 cats.  (Some people in Happy Valley like to keep chickens as pets!)  In how many ways can the 11 animals be placed in a row of 11 cages, such that all of the animals of each type are in adjacent cages?  (Two animals of the same species are considered distinguishable.)
