Reasoning: So i have this problem about dominoes. a domino is a rectangular tile with two squares, each showing an integer from 0 to 9. each integer is paired with every integer exactly once to form a complete set. i need to find the probability that a randomly selected domino from this set is a "double," which means both squares have the same integer.

first, i need to understand how many dominoes are in a complete set. since each integer from 0 to 9 is paired with every integer exactly once, i need to figure out how many unique pairs there are.

wait, but dominoes are symmetrical, right? that is, a domino with 2 and 5 is the same as one with 5 and 2. so, i shouldn't count both as separate dominoes.

so, the total number of unique dominoes should be the number of unique pairs (a, b) where a and b are integers from 0 to 9, and a โค b to account for the symmetry.

this sounds like a combination problem. the number of ways to choose 2 different numbers from 0 to 9, where order doesn't matter, is "10 choose 2."

but wait, there are also doubles, like (0,0), (1,1), up to (9,9). so, in addition to the "10 choose 2" pairs, there are these 10 doubles.

so, total number of dominoes is "10 choose 2" plus 10.

let me calculate that.

"10 choose 2" is 10! / (2! * (10-2)!)) = (10*9)/2 = 45.

plus 10 doubles, so total dominoes = 45 + 10 = 55.

okay, so there are 55 dominoes in total.

now, i need to find the probability that a randomly selected domino is a double.

there are 10 doubles: (0,0), (1,1), ..., (9,9).

so, the probability is the number of doubles divided by the total number of dominoes, which is 10/55.

i can simplify that fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 5: 10 รท 5 = 2, and 55 รท 5 = 11.

so, the probability is 2/11.

wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

first, total number of unique dominoes: "10 choose 2" is 45, plus 10 doubles, equals 55. that seems correct.

number of doubles is 10, which is straightforward.

so, probability is indeed 10/55, which simplifies to 2/11.

yes, that seems right.

alternatively, i can think about it in terms of selecting two numbers where order doesn't matter and considering the doubles separately.

but i think my initial approach is sufficient.

therefore, the probability is 2/11.

**final answer**
