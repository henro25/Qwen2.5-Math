Problem: A domino is a rectangular tile composed of two squares. An integer is represented on both squares, and each integer 0-9 is paired with every integer 0-9 exactly once to form a complete set. A $\textit{double}$ is a domino that has the same integer on both of its squares. What is the probability that a domino randomly selected from a set will be a $\textit{double}$? Express your answer as a common fraction.
