Reasoning: So i need to find the base 2 representation of 84 in base 10. that means i need to convert the decimal number 84 into binary. okay, let's think about how to do that.

first, i know that binary is base 2, which means it only uses 0 and 1. each digit in a binary number represents a power of 2, starting from the rightmost digit, which is 
2
0
2 
0
 , then 
2
1
2 
1
 , 
2
2
2 
2
 , and so on.

one way to convert a decimal number to binary is to divide the number by 2 repeatedly and keep track of the remainders. the binary representation is the sequence of remainders read from bottom to top.

so, let's try that with 84.

first, divide 84 by 2:

84
÷
2
=
42
84÷2=42 with a remainder of 0.

now, take 42 and divide by 2:

42
÷
2
=
21
42÷2=21 with a remainder of 0.

next, divide 21 by 2:

21
÷
2
=
10
21÷2=10 with a remainder of 1.

then, divide 10 by 2:

10
÷
2
=
5
10÷2=5 with a remainder of 0.

next, divide 5 by 2:

5
÷
2
=
2
5÷2=2 with a remainder of 1.

then, divide 2 by 2:

2
÷
2
=
1
2÷2=1 with a remainder of 0.

finally, divide 1 by 2:

1
÷
2
=
0
1÷2=0 with a remainder of 1.

now, i have the remainders: 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1.

to get the binary number, i need to read these remainders from bottom to top. so, starting from the last remainder:

1 (from 1 ÷ 2)

0 (from 2 ÷ 2)

1 (from 5 ÷ 2)

0 (from 10 ÷ 2)

1 (from 21 ÷ 2)

0 (from 42 ÷ 2)

0 (from 84 ÷ 2)

so, putting them together: 1010100.

wait, let me check if that's correct. maybe i should verify by converting it back to decimal to see if it equals 84.

starting with the binary number 1010100:

the rightmost digit is 
2
0
2 
0
 , then 
2
1
2 
1
 , up to 
2
6
2 
6
  since there are 7 digits.

so, let's calculate:

1
×
2
6
=
1
×
64
=
64
1×2 
6
 =1×64=64

0

5

32
=

0×2 
5
 =0×32=0

16

1×2

 =1×16=16

0

8

0×2

1×2 
2
 =1×4=4

0

2

2

0×2 
1
 =0×2=0

0
×
2
0
=
0
×
1
=
0
0×2 
0
 =0×1=0

now, add them up: 64 + 0 + 16 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 84.

okay, that matches the original number, so 1010100 in binary is indeed 84 in decimal.

alternatively, i could have used the method of finding the highest power of 2 less than or equal to 84 and subtracting it, then repeating the process with the remainder.

let's try that approach to confirm.

the powers of 2 are: 2^0=1, 2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32, 2^6=64, 2^7=128.

since 2^7=128 is greater than 84, the highest power less than or equal to 84 is 2^6=64.

so, 84 - 64 = 20. that corresponds to a 1 in the 
2
6
2 
6
  place.

now, take 20 and find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to 20, which is 16 (
2
4
2 
4
 ).

20 - 16 = 4. that's a 1 in the 
2
4
2 
4
  place.

next, 4 is exactly 
2
2
2 
2
 , so 4 - 4 = 0. that's a 1 in the 
2
2
2 
2
  place.

now, the remaining positions are 0.

so, putting it all together:

2
6
2 
6
 : 1

2
5
2 
5
 : 0 (since we skipped 
2
5
2 
5
 =32, which is more than 20)

2
4
2 
4
 : 1

2
3
2 
3
 : 0 (since we skipped 
2
3
2 
3
 =8, which is more than 4)

2
2
2 
2
 : 1

2
1
2 
1
 : 0

2
0
2 
0
 : 0

so, again, 1010100.

seems consistent with the previous method.

i think that's correct.

**final answer**

1010100
