Reasoning: So i've got this problem here. kevin has an elm tree that's 11 and 2/3 feet tall, and an oak tree that's 17 and 5/6 feet tall. i need to figure out how much taller the oak tree is compared to the elm tree, and express the answer as a simplified mixed number.

alright, first things first, i need to subtract the height of the elm tree from the height of the oak tree. so, it's oak height minus elm height.

the oak tree is 17 and 5/6 feet tall, and the elm tree is 11 and 2/3 feet tall. so, i need to calculate:

17 5/6 - 11 2/3

hmm, dealing with mixed numbers can be a bit tricky. maybe i should convert them to improper fractions first to make the subtraction easier.

let's start with the oak tree's height: 17 5/6.

to convert a mixed number to an improper fraction, i multiply the whole number by the denominator, add the numerator, and keep the same denominator.

so, for 17 5/6:

17 * 6 = 102

102 + 5 = 107

so, 17 5/6 is the same as 107/6.

now, the elm tree is 11 2/3.

let's do the same for 11 2/3:

11 * 3 = 33

33 + 2 = 35

so, 11 2/3 is the same as 35/3.

now, i need to subtract 35/3 from 107/6.

but before i can subtract these fractions, they need to have the same denominator. the denominators here are 6 and 3.

i know that 6 is a multiple of 3, specifically 3 times 2 is 6. so, i can convert 35/3 to a fraction with a denominator of 6.

to do that, i multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2:

35/3 * 2/2 = 70/6

now both fractions have the same denominator:

107/6 - 70/6

since the denominators are the same, i can just subtract the numerators:

107 - 70 = 37

so, 107/6 - 70/6 = 37/6

now, 37/6 is an improper fraction, but the problem asks for the answer as a simplified mixed number.

to convert 37/6 back to a mixed number, i divide 37 by 6.

6 goes into 37 six times because 6*6=36, which is less than 37.

37 minus 36 is 1, so the remainder is 1.

therefore, 37/6 is the same as 6 and 1/6.

so, the oak tree is 6 and 1/6 feet taller than the elm tree.

wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

starting with the heights:

oak: 17 5/6 = 107/6

elm: 11 2/3 = 35/3 = 70/6

subtracting: 107/6 - 70/6 = 37/6

convert back to a mixed number: 37 divided by 6 is 6 with a remainder of 1, so 6 1/6.

that seems correct.

alternatively, i could have subtracted the whole numbers and the fractions separately.

so, 17 - 11 = 6

then, 5/6 - 2/3

but 2/3 is the same as 4/6, so 5/6 - 4/6 = 1/6

so, 6 + 1/6 = 6 1/6

same answer. good, that confirms it.

i think that's the correct answer.

**final answer**
