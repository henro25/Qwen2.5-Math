Answer: Kevin has an elm tree that is \(11 \frac{2}{3}\) feet tall and an oak tree that is \(17 \frac{5}{6}\) feet tall. to find out how much taller the oak tree is compared to the elm tree, we need to subtract the height of the elm tree from the height of the oak tree.

first, we convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions:

\[
17 \frac{5}{6} = \frac{17 \times 6 + 5}{6} = \frac{102 + 5}{6} = \frac{107}{6}
\]

\[
11 \frac{2}{3} = \frac{11 \times 3 + 2}{3} = \frac{33 + 2}{3} = \frac{35}{3}
\]

next, we convert \(\frac{35}{3}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 6:

\[
\frac{35}{3} = \frac{35 \times 2}{3 \times 2} = \frac{70}{6}
\]

now, we subtract the fractions:

\[
\frac{107}{6} - \frac{70}{6} = \frac{107 - 70}{6} = \frac{37}{6}
\]

finally, we convert \(\frac{37}{6}\) back to a mixed number:

\[
\frac{37}{6} = 6 \frac{1}{6}
\]

thus, the oak tree is \(\boxed{6 \frac{1}{6}}\) feet taller than the elm tree.
