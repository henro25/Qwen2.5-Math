Answer: To find \( x \) such that \(\log_x 81 = \log_2 16\), we start by evaluating \(\log_2 16\). since \( 2^4 = 16 \), we have:

\[
\log_2 16 = 4
\]

this simplifies the original equation to:

\[
\log_x 81 = 4
\]

this means that \( x^4 = 81 \). to solve for \( x \), we take the fourth root of both sides:

\[
x = \sqrt[4]{81}
\]

since \( 81 = 3^4 \), we have:

\[
\sqrt[4]{81} = 3
\]

thus, \( x = 3 \).

to verify, we check that \(\log_3 81 = 4\) and \(\log_2 16 = 4\), confirming that both sides are equal when \( x = 3 \).

therefore, the solution is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]
