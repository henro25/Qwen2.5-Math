Answer: To solve the equation \(\frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x + 4} = x + 5\) for \(x\), we start by eliminating the denominator by multiplying both sides by \(x + 4\), assuming \(x \neq -4\):

\[
x^2 + 2x + 3 = (x + 5)(x + 4)
\]

expanding the right side:

\[
(x + 5)(x + 4) = x^2 + 9x + 20
\]

this simplifies to:

\[
x^2 + 2x + 3 = x^2 + 9x + 20
\]

subtracting \(x^2\) from both sides:

\[
2x + 3 = 9x + 20
\]

subtracting \(2x\) from both sides:

\[
3 = 7x + 20
\]

subtracting 20 from both sides:

\[
-17 = 7x
\]

dividing both sides by 7:

\[
x = -\frac{17}{7}
\]

we verify that \(x = -\frac{17}{7}\) is not equal to \(-4\) and check the solution by substituting back into the original equation. both sides equal \(\frac{18}{7}\), confirming the solution is correct.

thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{-\frac{17}{7}}
\]
