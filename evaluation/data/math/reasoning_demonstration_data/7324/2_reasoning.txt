Reasoning: I've got this equation to solve: 
x
2
+
2
x
+
3
x
+
4
=
x
+
5
x+4
x 
2
 +2x+3
​	
 =x+5. alright, let's see how to approach this. first off, i need to solve for 
x
x, which means i need to find the value or values of 
x
x that make this equation true.

so, i have a rational expression on the left side, and a linear expression on the right. maybe i can start by getting rid of the denominator to simplify things. to do that, i can multiply both sides of the equation by 
x
+
4
x+4, assuming that 
x
+
4
x+4 is not zero. wait, but if 
x
+
4
=
0
x+4=0, that would make the denominator zero, which is undefined. so, i should remember that 
x
≠
−
4
x

=−4.

alright, multiplying both sides by 
x
+
4
x+4, i get:

x
2
+
2
x
+
3
=
(
x
+
5
)
(
x
+
4
)
x 
2
 +2x+3=(x+5)(x+4)
now, let's expand the right side:

(
x
+
5
)
(
x
+
4
)
=
x
⋅
x
+
x
⋅
4
+
5
⋅
x
+
5
⋅
4
=
x
2
+
4
x
+
5
x
+
20
=
x
2
+
9
x
+
20
(x+5)(x+4)=x⋅x+x⋅4+5⋅x+5⋅4=x 
2
 +4x+5x+20=x 
2
 +9x+20
so, the equation now is:

x
2
+
2
x
+
3
=
x
2
+
9
x
+
20
x 
2
 +2x+3=x 
2
 +9x+20
hmm, both sides have 
x
2
x 
2
 , so maybe i can subtract 
x
2
x 
2
  from both sides to simplify:

2
x
+
3
=
9
x
+
20
2x+3=9x+20
now, i can try to get all the 
x
x terms on one side and the constants on the other. let's subtract 
2
x
2x from both sides:

3
=
7
x
+
20
3=7x+20
then, subtract 20 from both sides:

3
−
20
=
7
x
  
⟹
  
−
17
=
7
x
3−20=7x⟹−17=7x
now, divide both sides by 7:

x
=
−
17
7
x=− 
7
17
​	
 
wait a minute, i should check if this solution is valid, considering that 
x
≠
−
4
x

=−4. since 
−
17
7
− 
7
17
​	
  is not equal to 
−
4
−4, it seems valid.

but just to be thorough, maybe i should plug this value back into the original equation to make sure it works.

let's compute the left side:

(
−
17
7
)
2
+
2
(
−
17
7
)
+
3
−
17
7
+
4
=
289
49
−
34
7
+
3
11
7
− 
7
17
​	
 +4
(− 
7
17
​	
 ) 
2
 +2(− 
7
17
​	
 )+3
​	
 = 
7
11
​	
 
49
289
​	
 − 
7
34
​	
 +3
​	
 
first, simplify the numerator:

289
49
−
34
7
+
3
=
289
49
−
238
49
+
147
49
=
289
−
238
+
147
49
=
198
49
49
289
​	
 − 
7
34
​	
 +3= 
49
289
​	
 − 
49
238
​	
 + 
49
147
​	
 = 
49
289−238+147
​	
 = 
49
198
​	
 
now, the denominator is 
11
7
7
11
​	
 , so the whole expression becomes:

198
49
11
7
=
198
49
×
7
11
=
198
×
7
49
×
11
=
1386
539
7
11
​	
 
49
198
​	
 
​	
 = 
49
198
​	
 × 
11
7
​	
 = 
49×11
198×7
​	
 = 
539
1386
​	
 
simplifying 
1386
539
539
1386
​	
 , let's see:

both numerator and denominator are divisible by 7:

1386
÷
7
=
198
,
539
÷
7
=
77
1386÷7=198,539÷7=77
so, 
198
77
77
198
​	
 . again, both divisible by 11:

198
÷
11
=
18
,
77
÷
11
=
7
198÷11=18,77÷11=7
thus, 
18
7
7
18
​	
 .

now, let's compute the right side of the original equation with 
x
=
−
17
7
x=− 
7
17
​	
 :

x
+
5
=
−
17
7
+
5
=
−
17
7
+
35
7
=
18
7
x+5=− 
7
17
​	
 +5=− 
7
17
​	
 + 
7
35
​	
 = 
7
18
​	
 
hey, both sides equal 
18
7
7
18
​	
 , so the solution checks out.

wait, but maybe there are more solutions. could there be another value of 
x
x that satisfies the equation?

let me think about the steps i took. i started by multiplying both sides by 
x
+
4
x+4, assuming 
x
≠
−
4
x

=−4, which is fine because 
x
=
−
4
x=−4 would make the denominator zero.

then, i simplified and ended up with 
x
=
−
17
7
x=− 
7
17
​	
 , and verified that it works.

is there a possibility of another solution?

well, in equations involving rational expressions, sometimes extraneous solutions can appear, but in this case, since i only found one solution and it checks out, i think that's the only one.

alternatively, maybe i could approach this differently, like using polynomial division or something.

let's try polynomial long division on the left side: dividing 
x
2
+
2
x
+
3
x 
2
 +2x+3 by 
x
+
4
x+4.

dividing 
x
2
x 
2
  by 
x
x gives 
x
x, then multiply 
x
+
4
x+4 by 
x
x to get 
x
2
+
4
x
x 
2
 +4x. subtract that from 
x
2
+
2
x
+
3
x 
2
 +2x+3:

(
x
2
+
2
x
+
3
)
−
(
x
2
+
4
x
)
=
−
2
x
+
3
(x 
2
 +2x+3)−(x 
2
 +4x)=−2x+3
now, divide 
−
2
x
−2x by 
x
x to get 
−
2
−2, multiply 
x
+
4
x+4 by 
−
2
−2 to get 
−
2
x
−
8
−2x−8, subtract that from 
−
2
x
+
3
−2x+3:

(
−
2
x
+
3
)
−
(
−
2
x
−
8
)
=
11
(−2x+3)−(−2x−8)=11
so, the division gives 
x
−
2
x−2 with a remainder of 11, meaning:

x
2
+
2
x
+
3
x
+
4
=
x
−
2
+
11
x
+
4
x+4
x 
2
 +2x+3
​	
 =x−2+ 
x+4
11
​	
 
set this equal to 
x
+
5
x+5:

x
−
2
+
11
x
+
4
=
x
+
5
x−2+ 
x+4
11
​	
 =x+5
subtract 
x
x from both sides:

−
2
+
11
x
+
4
=
5
−2+ 
x+4
11
​	
 =5
add 2 to both sides:

11
x
+
4
=
7
x+4
11
​	
 =7
now, solve for 
x
x:

11
=
7
(
x
+
4
)
  
⟹
  
11
=
7
x
+
28
  
⟹
  
11
−
28
=
7
x
  
⟹
  
−
17
=
7
x
  
⟹
  
x
=
−
17
7
11=7(x+4)⟹11=7x+28⟹11−28=7x⟹−17=7x⟹x=− 
7
17
​	
 
same solution as before. so, this reinforces that 
x
=
−
17
7
x=− 
7
17
​	
  is the only solution.

alternatively, maybe i can graph both sides and see where they intersect.

the left side is 
x
2
+
2
x
+
3
x
+
4
x+4
x 
2
 +2x+3
​	
 , which is a rational function with a vertical asymptote at 
x
=
−
4
x=−4, and the right side is a straight line 
y
=
x
+
5
y=x+5.

since i've already found one intersection point at 
x
=
−
17
7
x=− 
7
17
​	
 , and considering the behavior of the rational function, it's unlikely there are more intersection points.

let me confirm by analyzing the functions:

the rational function 
x
2
+
2
x
+
3
x
+
4
x+4
x 
2
 +2x+3
​	
  can be rewritten as 
x
−
2
+
11
x
+
4
x−2+ 
x+4
11
​	
 , as i did earlier.

the line is 
y
=
x
+
5
y=x+5.

setting them equal gives 
x
−
2
+
11
x
+
4
=
x
+
5
x−2+ 
x+4
11
​	
 =x+5, which simplifies to 
11
x
+
4
=
7
x+4
11
​	
 =7, leading to 
x
=
−
17
7
x=− 
7
17
​	
 , as before.

therefore, there's only one solution.

i think i'm confident with this answer.

**final answer**

−
17
7
