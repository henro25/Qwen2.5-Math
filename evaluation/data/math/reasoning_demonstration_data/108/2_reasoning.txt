Reasoning: So i've got this problem here. it says that if we write the consecutive integers from 50 down to 1 as one big string, like 5049484746..., what is the 67th digit in that sequence?

first, i need to understand what's being asked. we're concatenating numbers from 50 to 1, writing them one after another without any spaces or commas, and then we need to find out what the 67th digit in this long string is.

okay, so let's think about how many digits each number contributes to this big string. the numbers from 50 to 10 are two-digit numbers, and the numbers from 9 down to 1 are single-digit numbers.

so, from 50 to 10, that's 50, 49, 48, ..., 10. how many numbers is that? well, 50 minus 10 is 40, but since we're including both endpoints, it's 50 - 10 + 1 = 41 numbers. each of these is a two-digit number, so they contribute 41 * 2 = 82 digits in total.

wait a minute, but we're looking for the 67th digit, and 82 digits is more than 67, so maybe i don't need to go all the way to 1. but actually, the problem says to write all numbers from 50 to 1, so i need to consider the entire sequence.

however, since 82 digits from the two-digit numbers already exceed 67, perhaps i don't need to go into the single-digit numbers. but let me check.

from 50 to 10: 41 numbers, each with 2 digits, so 82 digits.

from 9 to 1: 9 numbers, each with 1 digit, so 9 digits.

total digits: 82 + 9 = 91 digits.

but since 82 is already more than 67, the 67th digit must be within the two-digit numbers, from 50 to 10.

wait, but 41 * 2 = 82, which is more than 67, so the 67th digit is somewhere in the sequence of two-digit numbers.

now, i need to find out which specific number and which digit of that number corresponds to the 67th position.

let me think about it step by step.

first, how many digits do the two-digit numbers contribute before reaching the 67th digit.

if i start counting from the beginning, the first two digits are from 50, the next two from 49, and so on.

so, for each number from 50 downward, i add 2 digits to the sequence.

i need to find out how many complete two-digit numbers fit into the first 67 digits.

let me calculate how many full two-digit numbers fit into 67 digits.

since each two-digit number contributes 2 digits, the number of full two-digit numbers before reaching 67 digits is 67 divided by 2.

67 divided by 2 is 33.5, but since we can't have half a number, we take the integer part, which is 33.

so, 33 full two-digit numbers contribute 33 * 2 = 66 digits.

that means the 66th digit is the last digit of the 33rd two-digit number.

then, the 67th digit would be the first digit of the next number, which is the 34th two-digit number.

wait, but i need to be careful here.

let me verify.

from 50 downward, the sequence of two-digit numbers is 50, 49, 48, ..., 10.

so, the first number is 50, contributing digits 5 and 0 (positions 1 and 2), then 49 contributes 4 and 9 (positions 3 and 4), and so on.

after 33 two-digit numbers, we've used 33 * 2 = 66 digits.

so, the 33rd two-digit number is 50 - 32 = 18? wait, let me check.

wait, no. if the first number is 50, then the nth number is 50 - (n-1).

so, the 1st number is 50, the 2nd is 49, the 3rd is 48, and so on.

therefore, the 33rd number is 50 - (33 - 1) = 50 - 32 = 18.

so, the 33rd two-digit number is 18, contributing digits 1 and 8, which are positions 65 and 66.

then, the next number is the 34th two-digit number, which is 17, contributing digits 1 and 7.

therefore, the 67th digit is the first digit of 17, which is 1.

wait, but according to this, the 67th digit should be 1.

but let me double-check.

total digits from 50 to 18: 33 numbers * 2 digits = 66 digits.

so, positions 1 to 66 are covered by numbers 50 to 18.

then, the next number is 17, contributing digits 1 (position 67) and 7 (position 68).

therefore, the 67th digit is 1.

but the problem is asking for the 67th digit, so according to this, it should be 1.

but i have a feeling that might not be correct, because maybe i miscalculated the number of digits.

let me try another approach.

let's list out how many digits are contributed by each group of numbers.

first, numbers from 50 to 10 are two-digit numbers.

number of two-digit numbers from 50 to 10: 50 - 10 + 1 = 41 numbers.

each contributes 2 digits, so total digits from two-digit numbers: 41 * 2 = 82 digits.

then, numbers from 9 to 1 are single-digit numbers.

there are 9 numbers, contributing 9 digits.

total digits: 82 + 9 = 91 digits.

now, since 82 digits are from two-digit numbers, and 91 total digits, but we need the 67th digit.

since 67 is less than 82, it's within the two-digit numbers.

now, to find which two-digit number corresponds to the 67th digit.

we can calculate how many full two-digit numbers fit into 67 digits.

each two-digit number contributes 2 digits, so 67 divided by 2 is 33.5.

so, 33 full two-digit numbers contribute 33 * 2 = 66 digits.

therefore, the 66th digit is the last digit of the 33rd two-digit number.

then, the 67th digit is the first digit of the 34th two-digit number.

now, what is the 34th two-digit number in the sequence from 50 to 10?

the sequence is decreasing: 50, 49, 48, ..., 10.

so, the first number is 50, second is 49, ..., 33rd number is 50 - (33 - 1) = 50 - 32 = 18.

then, the 34th number is 17.

so, the digits of 17 are 1 and 7.

therefore, the 67th digit is 1, and the 68th is 7.

so, according to this, the answer should be 1.

but wait, i feel like maybe there's a mistake here.

let me try to list out the positions to see.

start with 50: digits 5 (position 1), 0 (position 2).

49: 4 (3), 9 (4).

48: 4 (5), 8 (6).

...

continuing this way until we reach the 67th digit.

but that would take too long.

alternatively, perhaps i can calculate the position more accurately.

total digits from 50 to 18: 33 numbers * 2 digits = 66 digits.

therefore, position 66 is the last digit of 18, which is 8.

then, position 67 is the first digit of the next number, which is 17, so 1.

therefore, the answer is 1.

but wait, in my initial calculation, i thought maybe it was different, but after checking, it seems consistent.

alternatively, perhaps i should consider that the sequence is decreasing, so the numbers are 50, 49, 48, ..., 10, 9, ..., 1.

but since 67 is within the two-digit numbers, and the first 66 digits cover numbers 50 to 18, then the 67th digit is the first digit of 17, which is 1.

therefore, the answer should be 1.

but i'm a bit uncertain because maybe i miscounted the number of two-digit numbers.

let me double-check the number of two-digit numbers from 50 to 10.

from 50 to 10 inclusive: 50 - 10 = 40, plus 1 is 41 numbers.

each contributes 2 digits, so 41 * 2 = 82 digits.

yes, that's correct.

then, 67 is less than 82, so within two-digit numbers.

then, 67 divided by 2 is 33.5, meaning 33 full two-digit numbers contribute 66 digits.

therefore, the 34th two-digit number is the one contributing the 67th digit as its first digit.

the sequence is decreasing: 50, 49, ..., 18 (33rd), then 17 (34th).

therefore, the 67th digit is 1.

so, the answer should be 1.

but i'm still a bit unsure because maybe i'm missing something.

let me try a different approach.

let's find out how many digits are there before a certain point.

for example, how many digits are there up to a certain number.

we can create a running total.

start with 50: digits 1 and 2.

49: digits 3 and 4.

...

continuing until we reach the digit position 67.

but that's time-consuming.

alternatively, perhaps i can think in terms of the position within the two-digit numbers.

total two-digit numbers: 41, contributing 82 digits.

we need the 67th digit, which is the (67 - 0)th digit in this sequence.

each two-digit number contributes 2 digits.

so, the number of full two-digit numbers before the 67th digit is floor((67 - 1)/2) = floor(66/2) = 33.

therefore, the 33rd two-digit number contributes up to the 66th digit.

then, the 34th two-digit number contributes the 67th and 68th digits.

now, what is the 34th two-digit number in the sequence from 50 to 10?

the sequence is decreasing: 50, 49, 48, ..., 18 (33rd), 17 (34th).

therefore, the 34th two-digit number is 17.

so, the 67th digit is the first digit of 17, which is 1.

therefore, the answer is 1.

i think that's correct.
