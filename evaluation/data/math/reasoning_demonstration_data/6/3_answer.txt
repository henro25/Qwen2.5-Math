Answer: To evaluate \(\lfloor{\pi}\rfloor\), we need to determine the greatest integer that is less than or equal to \(\pi\). 

1. \(\pi\) is approximately 3.1415926535.
2. the floor function, \(\lfloor x \rfloor\), gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\).
3. for \(\pi \approx 3.1415926535\), the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\pi\) is 3.

thus, \(\lfloor{\pi}\rfloor = 3\).

\[
\boxed{3}
\]
