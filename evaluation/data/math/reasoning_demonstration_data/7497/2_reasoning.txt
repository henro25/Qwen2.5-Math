Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: "let 
f
(
x
)
f(x) be an odd function. is 
f
(
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
)
f(f(f(x))) even, odd, or neither?" and i need to enter "odd", "even", or "neither". alright, let's break this down.

first, i need to remember what it means for a function to be odd or even. from what i recall:

- an even function satisfies 
f
(
−
x
)
=
f
(
x
)
f(−x)=f(x) for all 
x
x in its domain.

- an odd function satisfies 
f
(
−
x
)
=
−
f
(
x
)
f(−x)=−f(x) for all 
x
x in its domain.

so, 
f
(
x
)
f(x) is given as an odd function, meaning 
f
(
−
x
)
=
−
f
(
x
)
f(−x)=−f(x).

now, the question is about 
f
(
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
)
f(f(f(x))). that's 
f
f composed with itself three times. let's denote this as 
f
3
(
x
)
=
f
(
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
)
f 
3
 (x)=f(f(f(x))). i need to determine whether 
f
3
(
x
)
f 
3
 (x) is even, odd, or neither.

to do this, i should probably look at 
f
3
(
−
x
)
f 
3
 (−x) and see how it relates to 
f
3
(
x
)
f 
3
 (x).

so, let's compute 
f
3
(
−
x
)
f 
3
 (−x):

f
3
(
−
x
)
=
f
(
f
(
f
(
−
x
)
)
)
f 
3
 (−x)=f(f(f(−x)))
but since 
f
(
x
)
f(x) is odd, 
f
(
−
x
)
=
−
f
(
x
)
f(−x)=−f(x). so, plugging that in:

f
3
(
−
x
)
=
f
(
f
(
−
f
(
x
)
)
)
=
f
(
−
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
)
f 
3
 (−x)=f(f(−f(x)))=f(−f(f(x)))
now, again, 
f
f is odd, so 
f
(
−
y
)
=
−
f
(
y
)
f(−y)=−f(y) for any 
y
y. here, 
y
=
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
y=f(f(x)), so:

f
(
−
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
)
=
−
f
(
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
)
=
−
f
3
(
x
)
f(−f(f(x)))=−f(f(f(x)))=−f 
3
 (x)
therefore, 
f
3
(
−
x
)
=
−
f
3
(
x
)
f 
3
 (−x)=−f 
3
 (x), which matches the definition of an odd function.

wait a second, that seems straightforward. is there a chance i missed something?

let me double-check. maybe i should consider the properties of composing odd functions multiple times.

let's consider 
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
f(f(x)) first. let's denote 
f
2
(
x
)
=
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
f 
2
 (x)=f(f(x)). what is the parity of 
f
2
(
x
)
f 
2
 (x)?

compute 
f
2
(
−
x
)
=
f
(
f
(
−
x
)
)
=
f
(
−
f
(
x
)
)
=
−
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
=
−
f
2
(
x
)
f 
2
 (−x)=f(f(−x))=f(−f(x))=−f(f(x))=−f 
2
 (x). so, 
f
2
(
−
x
)
=
−
f
2
(
x
)
f 
2
 (−x)=−f 
2
 (x), which means 
f
2
(
x
)
f 
2
 (x) is also odd.

wait, but if i compose two odd functions, i might have thought that composing two odds could give something else. maybe i should verify.

alternatively, perhaps composing two odd functions gives an even function? let me check that.

let’s consider a specific example to test this.

take 
f
(
x
)
=
x
f(x)=x, which is odd since 
f
(
−
x
)
=
−
x
=
−
f
(
x
)
f(−x)=−x=−f(x).

then 
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
=
f
(
x
)
=
x
f(f(x))=f(x)=x, which is still odd.

hmm, that doesn't help much.

let’s try another function, say 
f
(
x
)
=
x
3
f(x)=x 
3
 , which is odd because 
f
(
−
x
)
=
(
−
x
)
3
=
−
x
3
=
−
f
(
x
)
f(−x)=(−x) 
3
 =−x 
3
 =−f(x).

then 
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
=
f
(
x
3
)
=
(
x
3
)
3
=
x
9
f(f(x))=f(x 
3
 )=(x 
3
 ) 
3
 =x 
9
 , which is also odd, since 
f
(
f
(
−
x
)
)
=
(
−
x
)
9
=
−
x
9
=
−
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
f(f(−x))=(−x) 
9
 =−x 
9
 =−f(f(x)).

wait, so in this case, composing two odd functions gives another odd function.

but earlier, when i thought about composing two odd functions, i thought maybe it could be even. maybe i was mistaken.

let me think again. suppose 
f
f is odd, and 
g
g is odd. then 
(
g
∘
f
)
(
−
x
)
=
g
(
f
(
−
x
)
)
=
g
(
−
f
(
x
)
)
=
−
g
(
f
(
x
)
)
=
−
(
g
∘
f
)
(
x
)
(g∘f)(−x)=g(f(−x))=g(−f(x))=−g(f(x))=−(g∘f)(x), which means the composition of two odd functions is odd.

wait, so composing two odd functions gives an odd function, not even. maybe i confused something else.

okay, so going back to the original problem. since 
f
f is odd, 
f
2
(
x
)
=
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
f 
2
 (x)=f(f(x)) is odd, and then 
f
3
(
x
)
=
f
(
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
)
f 
3
 (x)=f(f(f(x))) is 
f
f of an odd function, which should again be odd.

but let's verify this again more carefully.

we have 
f
3
(
−
x
)
=
f
(
f
(
f
(
−
x
)
)
)
=
f
(
f
(
−
f
(
x
)
)
)
=
f
(
−
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
)
=
−
f
(
f
(
f
(
x
)
)
)
=
−
f
3
(
x
)
f 
3
 (−x)=f(f(f(−x)))=f(f(−f(x)))=f(−f(f(x)))=−f(f(f(x)))=−f 
3
 (x), as i initially found.

this satisfies the definition of an odd function, where 
f
(
−
x
)
=
−
f
(
x
)
f(−x)=−f(x).

therefore, 
f
3
(
x
)
f 
3
 (x) is odd.

is there any possibility that it could be even or neither? it doesn't seem so based on this reasoning.

just to be thorough, let's consider if 
f
3
(
x
)
f 
3
 (x) could ever be even.

for 
f
3
(
x
)
f 
3
 (x) to be even, we would need 
f
3
(
−
x
)
=
f
3
(
x
)
f 
3
 (−x)=f 
3
 (x).

but from above, 
f
3
(
−
x
)
=
−
f
3
(
x
)
f 
3
 (−x)=−f 
3
 (x), which implies 
−
f
3
(
x
)
=
f
3
(
x
)
−f 
3
 (x)=f 
3
 (x), which would mean 
f
3
(
x
)
=
0
f 
3
 (x)=0 for all 
x
x.

that's only possible if 
f
(
x
)
=
0
f(x)=0, which is the zero function, but that's a trivial case. generally, 
f
(
x
)
f(x) is not necessarily zero.

therefore, in general, 
f
3
(
x
)
f 
3
 (x) is odd.

so, the answer should be "odd".

**final answer**

odd
