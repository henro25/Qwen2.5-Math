Answer: Given that \( f(x) \) is an odd function, we need to determine whether \( f(f(f(x))) \) is even, odd, or neither.

first, recall the definitions:
- an even function satisfies \( f(-x) = f(x) \).
- an odd function satisfies \( f(-x) = -f(x) \).

since \( f(x) \) is odd, we have \( f(-x) = -f(x) \).

now, consider \( f(f(f(x))) \). let's denote this as \( f^3(x) = f(f(f(x))) \). we need to determine the parity of \( f^3(x) \).

compute \( f^3(-x) \):

\[
f^3(-x) = f(f(f(-x)))
\]

using the property of \( f \) being odd:

\[
f(-x) = -f(x)
\]

so,

\[
f^3(-x) = f(f(-f(x))) = f(-f(f(x)))
\]

again, using the property of \( f \) being odd:

\[
f(-y) = -f(y) \quad \text{for any } y
\]

here, \( y = f(f(x)) \), so:

\[
f(-f(f(x))) = -f(f(f(x))) = -f^3(x)
\]

thus,

\[
f^3(-x) = -f^3(x)
\]

this matches the definition of an odd function. therefore, \( f^3(x) \) is odd.

\[
\boxed{\text{odd}}
\]
