Reasoning: Let's dive into this problem. so, we have a sequence defined recursively, starting with x₁ = ∛3, and each subsequent term is the previous term raised to the power of ∛3. and we need to find the smallest n where x_n is an integer. sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

first, let's understand the sequence:

x₁ = ∛3

x₂ = (∛3)^{∛3}

x₃ = [ (∛3)^{∛3} ]^{∛3} = (∛3)^{ (∛3)(∛3) } = (∛3)^{ (∛3)^2 }

wait, that seems a bit messy. maybe there's a better way to represent this.

alternatively, perhaps we can express everything in terms of exponents with base 3. since ∛3 is 3^{1/3}, maybe that will simplify things.

so, let's try that:

x₁ = 3^{1/3}

x₂ = (3^{1/3})^{3^{1/3}} = 3^{ (1/3) * 3^{1/3} }

hmm, still complicated. maybe if we take the logarithm to simplify the exponents.

let's consider taking the natural logarithm of x_n:

ln(x_n) = ln( x_{n-1}^{∛3} ) = ∛3 * ln(x_{n-1})

so, ln(x_n) = ∛3 * ln(x_{n-1})

this looks like a recursive relation for the logarithms of the sequence terms.

maybe we can find a pattern or a closed-form expression for ln(x_n).

let's see:

ln(x₁) = ln(3^{1/3}) = (1/3) ln 3

ln(x₂) = ∛3 * ln(x₁) = ∛3 * (1/3) ln 3

ln(x₃) = ∛3 * ln(x₂) = ∛3 * [ ∛3 * (1/3) ln 3 ] = (∛3)^2 * (1/3) ln 3

continuing this pattern, it seems that:

ln(x_n) = (∛3)^{n-1} * (1/3) ln 3

wait, is that right? let's check for n=1,2,3:

for n=1: ln(x₁) = (1/3) ln 3, which matches.

for n=2: ln(x₂) = ∛3 * (1/3) ln 3, which matches.

for n=3: ln(x₃) = (∛3)^2 * (1/3) ln 3, which matches.

okay, so it seems the pattern holds.

now, we can write:

ln(x_n) = (∛3)^{n-1} * (1/3) ln 3

exponentiating both sides to solve for x_n:

x_n = exp( (∛3)^{n-1} * (1/3) ln 3 ) = 3^{ [ (∛3)^{n-1} / 3 ] }

hmm, maybe i can simplify (∛3)^{n-1}.

since ∛3 = 3^{1/3}, then (∛3)^{n-1} = 3^{(n-1)/3}

so, x_n = 3^{ [ 3^{(n-1)/3} / 3 ] } = 3^{ [ 3^{(n-1)/3 - 1} ] } = 3^{ 3^{(n-1)/3 - 1} }

wait, that seems a bit off. let's double-check the exponents.

starting again:

x_n = 3^{ [ (∛3)^{n-1} / 3 ] } = 3^{ [ 3^{(n-1)/3} / 3 ] } = 3^{ 3^{(n-1)/3} / 3 }

but 3^{a} / 3 = 3^{a - 1}, so:

x_n = 3^{ 3^{(n-1)/3 - 1} } = 3^{ 3^{(n-1)/3 - 3/3} } = 3^{ 3^{(n-4)/3} }

wait, that doesn't seem helpful. maybe i need to approach this differently.

alternatively, perhaps i can express everything in terms of exponents with base e, but that might not simplify things.

let me think about the properties of exponents and logarithms here.

we have x_n = (x_{n-1})^{∛3}, and x₁ = ∛3.

this seems like a power tower of ∛3's of height n.

in other words, x_n = ∛3 towered n times.

i recall that infinite power towers can converge to certain values, but here we have a finite tower, and we need it to be an integer.

wait, but n is finite, and we need x_n to be an integer.

perhaps i should compute the first few terms numerically to see if any of them are integers.

let's calculate x₁, x₂, x₃, etc.

x₁ = ∛3 ≈ 1.44225

x₂ = (1.44225)^{1.44225} ≈ 1.44225^{1.44225} ≈ 1.551...

x₃ = (1.551)^{1.44225} ≈ 1.778...

x₄ = (1.778)^{1.44225} ≈ 2.0...

wait, x₄ seems to be approximately 2.

is 2 an integer? yes, it is.

but is this exact? or is it just an approximation?

maybe i should check if x₄ is exactly 2.

let's try to see if x₄ = 2.

assume x₄ = 2.

then, x₄ = (x₃)^{∛3} = 2.

so, x₃ = 2^{1/∛3}.

but x₃ = (x₂)^{∛3}.

wait, this seems messy. maybe there's a better way to approach this.

alternatively, perhaps i can take logarithms in base 3.

let me define y_n = log_3(x_n).

then, since x_n = x_{n-1}^{∛3}, taking log base 3:

y_n = log_3( x_{n-1}^{∛3} ) = ∛3 * log_3(x_{n-1}) = ∛3 * y_{n-1}

so, y_n = ∛3 * y_{n-1}

this is a simple recursive relation.

given that y₁ = log_3(x₁) = log_3(∛3) = log_3(3^{1/3}) = 1/3.

therefore, y_n = (∛3)^{n-1} * y₁ = (∛3)^{n-1} * (1/3)

so, y_n = (∛3)^{n-1} / 3

but ∛3 = 3^{1/3}, so:

y_n = 3^{(n-1)/3} / 3 = 3^{(n-1)/3 - 1} = 3^{(n-4)/3}

therefore, x_n = 3^{ y_n } = 3^{ 3^{(n-4)/3} }

wait, that seems a bit circular. maybe i need to consider when x_n is an integer.

for x_n to be an integer, 3^{ y_n } must be an integer, which means that y_n must be such that 3^{ y_n } is an integer.

but 3^{ y_n } is an integer only if y_n is an integer exponent of 3, or if y_n is such that 3^{ y_n } is an integer.

this seems a bit vague. maybe i need to find when y_n is an integer.

wait, y_n = log_3(x_n), so if x_n is an integer power of 3, then y_n is an integer.

so, if x_n = 3^k for some integer k, then y_n = k, which is an integer.

therefore, if x_n is an integer, and specifically a power of 3, then y_n is an integer.

but is it possible for x_n to be an integer that's not a power of 3? well, 3 is prime, so any integer power of 3 is just 3^k, where k is an integer.

but in our sequence, x_n is built from exponents of ∛3, so it's unlikely to hit other integers, but let's see.

given that y_n = 3^{(n-4)/3}, as above, but that may not be accurate. let me re-examine.

earlier, i had:

y_n = (∛3)^{n-1} / 3 = 3^{(n-1)/3} / 3 = 3^{(n-1)/3 - 1} = 3^{(n-4)/3}

wait, but 3^{(n-4)/3} is the same as [3^{1/3}]^{n-4}, which is (∛3)^{n-4}

so, y_n = (∛3)^{n-4}

wait, that seems off. maybe i made a mistake in the exponents.

let me double-check:

y_n = (∛3)^{n-1} / 3 = 3^{(n-1)/3} / 3 = 3^{(n-1)/3 - 1} = 3^{(n-1)/3 - 3/3} = 3^{(n-4)/3}

yes, that's correct.

so, y_n = 3^{(n-4)/3}

then, x_n = 3^{ y_n } = 3^{ 3^{(n-4)/3} }

this seems complicated, but perhaps there's a better way to think about it.

alternatively, perhaps i can look for n such that x_n is an integer.

given that x_n = (x_{n-1})^{∛3}, and x₁ = ∛3.

we can write x_n as ∛3 towered n times.

i recall that for infinite power towers, there is a convergence, but here we have finite towers.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider taking logarithms multiple times.

but maybe that's not the best approach.

let me try to compute x₄ more carefully.

x₁ = ∛3 ≈ 1.44225

x₂ = (1.44225)^{1.44225} ≈ 1.551...

x₃ = (1.551)^{1.44225} ≈ 1.778...

x₄ = (1.778)^{1.44225} ≈ 2.0...

is this exact? probably not, but maybe it's approaching 2.

wait, perhaps at n=4, x₄ is exactly 2.

let's assume x₄ = 2 and see if it fits.

if x₄ = 2, then x₄ = (x₃)^{∛3} = 2

so, x₃ = 2^{1/∛3}

but x₃ = (x₂)^{∛3}

so, x₂ = [x₃]^{1/∛3} = [2^{1/∛3}]^{1/∛3} = 2^{1/(∛3)^2}

hmm, this seems too convoluted. maybe i should consider expressing everything in terms of exponents with base 3.

let me try that again.

we have y_n = log_3(x_n) = 3^{(n-4)/3}

so, x_n = 3^{ 3^{(n-4)/3} }

for x_n to be an integer, 3^{ 3^{(n-4)/3} } must be an integer.

but 3^{a} is an integer only if a is an integer exponent of log base 3 of some integer, which is not straightforward.

alternatively, perhaps i can set 3^{(n-4)/3} to be an integer.

let me suppose that 3^{(n-4)/3} is an integer.

let’s set k = 3^{(n-4)/3}, where k is an integer.

then, taking logarithms:

log_3(k) = (n-4)/3

so, n - 4 = 3 log_3(k)

therefore, n = 3 log_3(k) + 4

for n to be an integer, 3 log_3(k) must be an integer, which implies that log_3(k) is rational, specifically a multiple of 1/3.

but log_3(k) = m/3, where m is an integer.

therefore, k = 3^{m/3} = (∛3)^m

but k must be an integer, and ∛3 is irrational, so (∛3)^m is irrational for integer m unless m is a multiple of 3.

wait, if m is a multiple of 3, say m = 3p, then k = (∛3)^{3p} = 3^{p}

so, k = 3^p, where p is an integer.

then, log_3(k) = p

so, n = 3p + 4

now, substituting back, since k = 3^p, and k = 3^{(n-4)/3}, we have:

3^p = 3^{(n-4)/3}

therefore, p = (n-4)/3

but from n = 3p + 4, we have p = (n - 4)/3, which matches.

so, for x_n to be an integer, n must be of the form n = 3p + 4, where p is an integer.

but p must also be such that k = 3^p is an integer, which it always is for integer p.

however, p can be zero or positive integers.

let's try p = 0:

n = 3(0) + 4 = 4

so, n = 4

is x₄ an integer?

earlier approximation suggested x₄ ≈ 2, which is an integer.

let me check if x₄ = 2 exactly.

assume x₄ = 2

then, x₃ = 2^{1/∛3}

but x₃ = (x₂)^{∛3}

so, x₂ = [x₃]^{1/∛3} = [2^{1/∛3}]^{1/∛3} = 2^{1/(∛3)^2}

this seems too complicated to verify directly.

alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to confirm if x₄ is indeed 2.

let me consider taking logarithms again.

we have y₄ = log_3(x₄) = 3^{(4-4)/3} = 3^{0} = 1

therefore, x₄ = 3^{1} = 3

wait, that contradicts my earlier approximation of x₄ ≈ 2.

did i make a mistake here?

wait, according to the formula y_n = 3^{(n-4)/3}, for n=4, y₄ = 3^{0} = 1, so x₄ = 3^{1} = 3

but earlier, numerically, i got x₄ ≈ 2.

that doesn't match.

so, perhaps my formula for y_n is incorrect.

let me go back and check.

earlier, i had:

y_n = (∛3)^{n-1} / 3

but ∛3 = 3^{1/3}, so:

y_n = 3^{(n-1)/3} / 3 = 3^{(n-1)/3 - 1} = 3^{(n-4)/3}

so, y_n = 3^{(n-4)/3}

then, x_n = 3^{ y_n } = 3^{ 3^{(n-4)/3} }

but according to this, for n=4, y₄ = 3^{0} = 1, so x₄ = 3^1 = 3

but my numerical approximation suggested x₄ ≈ 2.

so, there must be an error in my approach.

alternatively, perhaps the recursive relation for y_n is not accurate.

let me re-examine the relation.

given that y_n = log_3(x_n), and x_n = x_{n-1}^{∛3}

then, y_n = log_3(x_{n-1}^{∛3}) = ∛3 * log_3(x_{n-1}) = ∛3 * y_{n-1}

so, y_n = ∛3 * y_{n-1}

this is a simple recursive relation.

given y₁ = log_3(x₁) = log_3(∛3) = 1/3

then, y₂ = ∛3 * y₁ = ∛3 * (1/3)

y₃ = ∛3 * y₂ = ∛3 * (∛3 * 1/3) = (∛3)^2 / 3

y₄ = ∛3 * y₃ = ∛3 * (∛3)^2 / 3 = (∛3)^3 / 3 = 3^{1} / 3 = 1

so, y₄ = 1

therefore, x₄ = 3^{y₄} = 3^1 = 3

but earlier, numerically, i thought x₄ was approximately 2.

perhaps my numerical approximation was off.

let me recalculate x₄ more accurately.

given x₁ = ∛3 ≈ 1.44225

x₂ = (1.44225)^{1.44225}

let me compute this more precisely.

first, ln(x₂) = 1.44225 * ln(1.44225) ≈ 1.44225 * 0.36464 ≈ 0.5258

so, x₂ ≈ e^{0.5258} ≈ 1.6935

then, x₃ = (1.6935)^{1.44225}

compute ln(x₃) = 1.44225 * ln(1.6935) ≈ 1.44225 * 0.5267 ≈ 0.7585

so, x₃ ≈ e^{0.7585} ≈ 2.134

then, x₄ = (2.134)^{1.44225}

ln(x₄) = 1.44225 * ln(2.134) ≈ 1.44225 * 0.7570 ≈ 1.0905

so, x₄ ≈ e^{1.0905} ≈ 2.978, which is approximately 3.

ah, so my earlier approximation was off. it seems x₄ ≈ 3, which matches the formula.

therefore, x₄ = 3, which is an integer.

so, n=4 is the smallest n where x_n is an integer.

but to be thorough, let's check n=3.

x₃ ≈ 2.134, which is not an integer.

n=2, x₂ ≈ 1.6935, not an integer.

n=1, x₁ ≈ 1.44225, not an integer.

so, indeed, n=4 is the smallest value where x_n is an integer.

**final answer**
