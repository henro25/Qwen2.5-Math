Answer: Given the sequence \( x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots \) defined by:
\[
x_1 = \sqrt[3]{3}, \quad x_2 = (\sqrt[3]{3})^{\sqrt[3]{3}}, \quad \text{and in general,} \quad x_n = (x_{n-1})^{\sqrt[3]{3}} \text{ for } n > 1,
\]
we need to find the smallest value of \( n \) for which \( x_n \) is an integer.

first, we express the terms in terms of exponents with base 3:
\[
x_1 = 3^{1/3},
\]
\[
x_2 = (3^{1/3})^{3^{1/3}} = 3^{(1/3) \cdot 3^{1/3}},
\]
\[
x_3 = (x_2)^{3^{1/3}} = 3^{(1/3) \cdot (3^{1/3})^2},
\]
and so on.

we define \( y_n = \log_3(x_n) \), which gives us the recursive relation:
\[
y_n = 3^{1/3} \cdot y_{n-1}.
\]
starting with \( y_1 = \log_3(3^{1/3}) = \frac{1}{3} \), we find:
\[
y_2 = 3^{1/3} \cdot \frac{1}{3},
\]
\[
y_3 = 3^{1/3} \cdot y_2 = 3^{1/3} \cdot 3^{1/3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 3^{2/3} \cdot \frac{1}{3},
\]
\[
y_4 = 3^{1/3} \cdot y_3 = 3^{1/3} \cdot 3^{2/3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 3^{(1/3 + 2/3)} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 3^1 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 1.
\]
thus, \( y_4 = 1 \), which implies \( x_4 = 3^1 = 3 \), an integer.

therefore, the smallest value of \( n \) for which \( x_n \) is an integer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
