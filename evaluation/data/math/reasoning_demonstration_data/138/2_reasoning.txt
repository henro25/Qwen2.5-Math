Reasoning: So i need to find out how many times the graphs of 
r
=
4
cos
⁡
θ
r=4cosθ and 
r
=
8
sin
⁡
θ
r=8sinθ intersect. i'm not super confident with polar coordinates, but i remember that 
r
r is the distance from the origin, and 
θ
θ is the angle from the positive x-axis.

first, i should probably sketch these two graphs to get a sense of where they might intersect.

the equation 
r
=
4
cos
⁡
θ
r=4cosθ is a standard polar equation for a circle. i think it's a circle that's shifted along the x-axis. let me recall: in polar coordinates, 
r
=
a
cos
⁡
θ
r=acosθ represents a circle with radius 
a
2
2
a
​
  centered at 
(
a
2
,
0
)
( 
2
a
​
 ,0) in cartesian coordinates. so, for 
r
=
4
cos
⁡
θ
r=4cosθ, the circle should have a radius of 2 and be centered at (2, 0).

similarly, 
r
=
8
sin
⁡
θ
r=8sinθ should be a circle with radius 4 centered at (0, 4), since 
r
=
a
sin
⁡
θ
r=asinθ represents a circle of radius 
a
2
2
a
​
  centered at 
(
0
,
a
2
)
(0, 
2
a
​
 ).

so, i have one circle centered at (2, 0) with radius 2, and another centered at (0, 4) with radius 4. to find their points of intersection, i can set the equations equal to each other and solve for 
θ
θ, but maybe it's easier to convert them to cartesian coordinates and solve the system of equations.

let's try that.

first, convert 
r
=
4
cos
⁡
θ
r=4cosθ to cartesian:

i know that 
r
=
x
2
+
y
2
r= 
x 
2
 +y 
2
 
​
 , 
x
=
r
cos
⁡
θ
x=rcosθ, and 
y
=
r
sin
⁡
θ
y=rsinθ. so, 
r
=
4
cos
⁡
θ
r=4cosθ becomes:

x
2
+
y
2
=
4
⋅
x
x
2
+
y
2
x 
2
 +y 
2
 
​
 =4⋅ 
x 
2
 +y 
2
 
​
 
x
​
 

multiply both sides by 
x
2
+
y
2
x 
2
 +y 
2
 
​
 :

x
2
+
y
2
=
4
x
x 
2
 +y 
2
 =4x

that's the equation of a circle: 
x
2
+
y
2
−
4
x
=
0
x 
2
 +y 
2
 −4x=0, or 
(
x
−
2
)
2
+
y
2
=
4
(x−2) 
2
 +y 
2
 =4, confirming what i thought earlier.

now, 
r
=
8
sin
⁡
θ
r=8sinθ:

similarly, 
x
2
+
y
2
=
8
⋅
y
x
2
+
y
2
x 
2
 +y 
2
 
​
 =8⋅ 
x 
2
 +y 
2
 
​
 
y
​
 

multiply both sides by 
x
2
+
y
2
x 
2
 +y 
2
 
​
 :

x
2
+
y
2
=
8
y
x 
2
 +y 
2
 =8y

so, 
x
2
+
y
2
−
8
y
=
0
x 
2
 +y 
2
 −8y=0, or 
x
2
+
(
y
−
4
)
2
=
16
x 
2
 +(y−4) 
2
 =16, again confirming the center and radius.

now, to find the points of intersection, i need to solve the system:

(
x
−
2
)
2
+
y
2
=
4
(x−2) 
2
 +y 
2
 =4

and

x
2
+
(
y
−
4
)
2
=
16
x 
2
 +(y−4) 
2
 =16

let me expand both equations:

first equation:

x
2
−
4
x
+
4
+
y
2
=
4
x 
2
 −4x+4+y 
2
 =4

simplify:

x
2
−
4
x
+
y
2
=
0
x 
2
 −4x+y 
2
 =0 ... (1)

second equation:

x
2
+
y
2
−
8
y
+
16
=
16
x 
2
 +y 
2
 −8y+16=16

simplify:

x
2
+
y
2
−
8
y
=
0
x 
2
 +y 
2
 −8y=0 ... (2)

now, subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

(
x
2
+
y
2
−
8
y
)
−
(
x
2
−
4
x
+
y
2
)
=
0
−
0
(x 
2
 +y 
2
 −8y)−(x 
2
 −4x+y 
2
 )=0−0

this simplifies to:

−
8
y
+
4
x
=
0
−8y+4x=0

so, 
4
x
−
8
y
=
0
4x−8y=0, or 
x
=
2
y
x=2y

now, substitute 
x
=
2
y
x=2y back into equation (1):

(
2
y
)
2
−
4
(
2
y
)
+
y
2
=
0
(2y) 
2
 −4(2y)+y 
2
 =0

4
y
2
−
8
y
+
y
2
=
0
4y 
2
 −8y+y 
2
 =0

5
y
2
−
8
y
=
0
5y 
2
 −8y=0

factor:

y
(
5
y
−
8
)
=
0
y(5y−8)=0

so, 
y
=
0
y=0 or 
y
=
8
5
y= 
5
8
​
 

now, find corresponding 
x
x values:

if 
y
=
0
y=0, then 
x
=
2
(
0
)
=
0
x=2(0)=0. so, one point is (0, 0).

if 
y
=
8
5
y= 
5
8
​
 , then 
x
=
2
⋅
8
5
=
16
5
x=2⋅ 
5
8
​
 = 
5
16
​
 . so, the other point is 
(
16
5
,
8
5
)
( 
5
16
​
 , 
5
8
​
 ).

therefore, the two circles intersect at (0, 0) and 
(
16
5
,
8
5
)
( 
5
16
​
 , 
5
8
​
 ), meaning they intersect twice.

but wait, in polar coordinates, the origin can have multiple representations. for example, 
r
=
0
r=0 for any 
θ
θ. so, does (0, 0) count as one point of intersection or multiple?

looking back at the original equations:

for 
r
=
4
cos
⁡
θ
r=4cosθ, when 
θ
=
π
2
θ= 
2
π
​
 , 
r
=
0
r=0.

for 
r
=
8
sin
⁡
θ
r=8sinθ, when 
θ
=
0
θ=0, 
r
=
0
r=0.

so, (0, 0) appears for different 
θ
θ values in each equation. does that mean it's the same point?

yes, because in cartesian coordinates, (0, 0) is just one point. so, even though it corresponds to different 
θ
θ in each equation, it's still the same point.

therefore, the graphs intersect at two distinct points: (0, 0) and 
(
16
5
,
8
5
)
( 
5
16
​
 , 
5
8
​
 ).

alternatively, i could solve this directly in polar coordinates without converting to cartesian.

set 
4
cos
⁡
θ
=
8
sin
⁡
θ
4cosθ=8sinθ

so, 
4
cos
⁡
θ
=
8
sin
⁡
θ
4cosθ=8sinθ

divide both sides by 4:

cos
⁡
θ
=
2
sin
⁡
θ
cosθ=2sinθ

divide both sides by 
cos
⁡
θ
cosθ (assuming 
cos
⁡
θ
≠
0
cosθ

=0):

1
=
2
tan
⁡
θ
1=2tanθ

so, 
tan
⁡
θ
=
1
2
tanθ= 
2
1
​
 

this gives 
θ
=
arctan
⁡
(
1
2
)
θ=arctan( 
2
1
​
 ), which has solutions in the first and third quadrants.

but i need to consider the range of 
θ
θ. typically, 
θ
θ is considered from 0 to 
2
π
2π.

so, two solutions for 
θ
θ in 
[
0
,
2
π
)
[0,2π):

θ
=
arctan
⁡
(
1
2
)
θ=arctan( 
2
1
​
 ) and 
θ
=
arctan
⁡
(
1
2
)
+
π
θ=arctan( 
2
1
​
 )+π

additionally, i should check if 
r
=
0
r=0 is a solution for both equations, which would correspond to the origin.

for 
r
=
4
cos
⁡
θ
r=4cosθ, 
r
=
0
r=0 when 
cos
⁡
θ
=
0
cosθ=0, i.e., 
θ
=
π
2
θ= 
2
π
​
  or 
θ
=
3
π
2
θ= 
2
3π
​
 .

for 
r
=
8
sin
⁡
θ
r=8sinθ, 
r
=
0
r=0 when 
sin
⁡
θ
=
0
sinθ=0, i.e., 
θ
=
0
θ=0, 
π
π, or 
2
π
2π.

so, the only point where both 
r
=
0
r=0 is at the origin, as discussed earlier.

therefore, there are two distinct points of intersection.

wait a minute, but when solving 
4
cos
⁡
θ
=
8
sin
⁡
θ
4cosθ=8sinθ, i got two solutions for 
θ
θ, plus the origin. does that mean three points of intersection?

let me check.

the two solutions from 
tan
⁡
θ
=
1
2
tanθ= 
2
1
​
  correspond to two distinct points because adding 
π
π to 
θ
θ changes the sign of both 
sin
⁡
θ
sinθ and 
cos
⁡
θ
cosθ, but since 
r
r is positive, the points are distinct.

additionally, the origin is another point of intersection.

but in cartesian coordinates, we found only two distinct points: (0,0) and 
(
16
5
,
8
5
)
( 
5
16
​
 , 
5
8
​
 ).

wait, maybe i'm confusing something.

let me think again.

in polar coordinates, the point 
(
r
,
θ
)
(r,θ) and 
(
r
,
θ
+
2
π
)
(r,θ+2π) represent the same point.

moreover, 
(
0
,
θ
)
(0,θ) is always the origin, regardless of 
θ
θ.

so, when solving 
4
cos
⁡
θ
=
8
sin
⁡
θ
4cosθ=8sinθ, i got 
tan
⁡
θ
=
1
2
tanθ= 
2
1
​
 , which has two solutions in 
[
0
,
2
π
)
[0,2π): one in the first quadrant and one in the third quadrant.

each of these corresponds to a distinct point unless they coincide.

in this case, they don't coincide, so that's two points.

additionally, both curves pass through the origin, but that's one point.

however, in cartesian coordinates, we only have two distinct points of intersection: the origin and 
(
16
5
,
8
5
)
( 
5
16
​
 , 
5
8
​
 ).

but according to the polar equations, there are two solutions from 
tan
⁡
θ
=
1
2
tanθ= 
2
1
​
 , and the origin.

this seems inconsistent.

wait, maybe i made a mistake in the cartesian conversion.

let me double-check.

we had:

(
x
−
2
)
2
+
y
2
=
4
(x−2) 
2
 +y 
2
 =4

and

x
2
+
(
y
−
4
)
2
=
16
x 
2
 +(y−4) 
2
 =16

expanding:

x
2
−
4
x
+
4
+
y
2
=
4
x 
2
 −4x+4+y 
2
 =4 → 
x
2
−
4
x
+
y
2
=
0
x 
2
 −4x+y 
2
 =0 ... (1)

x
2
+
y
2
−
8
y
+
16
=
16
x 
2
 +y 
2
 −8y+16=16 → 
x
2
+
y
2
−
8
y
=
0
x 
2
 +y 
2
 −8y=0 ... (2)

subtracting (1) from (2):

−
8
y
+
4
x
=
0
−8y+4x=0 → 
x
=
2
y
x=2y

substitute into (1):

(
2
y
)
2
−
4
(
2
y
)
+
y
2
=
0
(2y) 
2
 −4(2y)+y 
2
 =0 → 
4
y
2
−
8
y
+
y
2
=
0
4y 
2
 −8y+y 
2
 =0 → 
5
y
2
−
8
y
=
0
5y 
2
 −8y=0 → 
y
(
5
y
−
8
)
=
0
y(5y−8)=0

so, 
y
=
0
y=0 or 
y
=
8
5
y= 
5
8
​
 

then, 
x
=
0
x=0 or 
x
=
16
5
x= 
5
16
​
 , giving points (0,0) and 
(
16
5
,
8
5
)
( 
5
16
​
 , 
5
8
​
 )

so, two points of intersection.

but in polar coordinates, solving 
4
cos
⁡
θ
=
8
sin
⁡
θ
4cosθ=8sinθ, i get two values of 
θ
θ, plus the origin.

how does this reconcile?

well, the two solutions from 
tan
⁡
θ
=
1
2
tanθ= 
2
1
​
  correspond to the point 
(
16
5
,
8
5
)
( 
5
16
​
 , 
5
8
​
 ) because plugging 
θ
=
arctan
⁡
(
1
2
)
θ=arctan( 
2
1
​
 ) into either equation should give the same 
r
r.

wait, no.

let me calculate 
r
r for 
θ
=
arctan
⁡
(
1
2
)
θ=arctan( 
2
1
​
 ):

let 
θ
=
α
θ=α, where 
tan
⁡
α
=
1
2
tanα= 
2
1
​
 

then, 
cos
⁡
α
=
2
5
cosα= 
5
​
 
2
​
 , 
sin
⁡
α
=
1
5
sinα= 
5
​
 
1
​
 

so, 
r
=
4
cos
⁡
α
=
4
⋅
2
5
=
8
5
r=4cosα=4⋅ 
5
​
 
2
​
 = 
5
​
 
8
​
 

and 
r
=
8
sin
⁡
α
=
8
⋅
1
5
=
8
5
r=8sinα=8⋅ 
5
​
 
1
​
 = 
5
​
 
8
​
 

so, both give the same 
r
r, which corresponds to the point 
(
16
5
,
8
5
)
( 
5
16
​
 , 
5
8
​
 )

similarly, for 
θ
=
α
+
π
θ=α+π, 
cos
⁡
(
α
+
π
)
=
−
cos
⁡
α
=
−
2
5
cos(α+π)=−cosα=− 
5
​
 
2
​
 , 
sin
⁡
(
α
+
π
)
=
−
sin
⁡
α
=
−
1
5
sin(α+π)=−sinα=− 
5
​
 
1
​
 

then, 
r
=
4
cos
⁡
(
α
+
π
)
=
4
⋅
(
−
2
5
)
=
−
8
5
r=4cos(α+π)=4⋅(− 
5
​
 
2
​
 )=− 
5
​
 
8
​
 

but in polar coordinates, 
r
r is typically taken as positive, so 
r
=
8
5
r= 
5
​
 
8
​
  with 
θ
=
α
+
π
θ=α+π would be the same as 
r
=
8
5
r= 
5
​
 
8
​
  with 
θ
=
α
+
π
+
π
=
α
θ=α+π+π=α, which seems confusing.

alternatively, 
r
=
−
8
5
r=− 
5
​
 
8
​
  with 
θ
=
α
+
π
θ=α+π points in the same direction as 
r
=
8
5
r= 
5
​
 
8
​
  with 
θ
=
α
θ=α.

therefore, both solutions for 
θ
θ correspond to the same point 
(
16
5
,
8
5
)
( 
5
16
​
 , 
5
8
​
 ), and the origin is another distinct point.

therefore, total two distinct points of intersection.

wait, but that would mean that the two different 
θ
θ values in polar coordinates correspond to the same point in cartesian coordinates.

so, even though there are two solutions for 
θ
θ, they both correspond to the same point in the plane, plus the origin.

therefore, only two distinct points of intersection: the origin and 
(
16
5
,
8
5
)
( 
5
16
​
 , 
5
8
​
 ).

but i'm still a bit confused because in polar coordinates, two different 
θ
θ values can represent the same point if 
r
r is adjusted accordingly.

maybe to be thorough, i should plot these equations or think about their graphs more carefully.

alternatively, consider the general approach to find intersection points in polar coordinates.

set 
r
1
=
r
2
r 
1
​
 =r 
2
​
  and 
θ
1
=
θ
2
+
2
π
k
θ 
1
​
 =θ 
2
​
 +2πk, but in this case, since both equations are expressed in terms of 
θ
θ, it's simpler to set 
4
cos
⁡
θ
=
8
sin
⁡
θ
4cosθ=8sinθ, which led to 
tan
⁡
θ
=
1
2
tanθ= 
2
1
​
 , giving two solutions in 
[
0
,
2
π
)
[0,2π).

however, as established earlier, these two solutions correspond to the same point in cartesian coordinates.

therefore, there are two distinct points of intersection.

alternatively, perhaps there is a better way to confirm this.

let me consider the graphs again.

the circle 
r
=
4
cos
⁡
θ
r=4cosθ is centered at (2,0) with radius 2.

the circle 
r
=
8
sin
⁡
θ
r=8sinθ is centered at (0,4) with radius 4.

the distance between centers is 
(
2
)
2
+
(
4
)
2
=
4
+
16
=
20
=
2
5
≈
4.472
(2) 
2
 +(4) 
2
 
​
 = 
4+16
​
 = 
20
​
 =2 
5
​
 ≈4.472

the sum of the radii is 
2
+
4
=
6
2+4=6, and the difference is 
4
−
2
=
2
4−2=2.

since 
2

 <6, the circles intersect at two distinct points.

therefore, the answer should be two points of intersection.

wait, but earlier i thought there were only two points: the origin and 
(
16
5
,
8
5
)
( 
5
16
​
 , 
5
8
​
 ), but actually, in the cartesian solution, we have two points, and in polar, solving gives two 
θ
θ values corresponding to the same point plus the origin, which is another point. so, total two points.

but according to the geometric interpretation, there should be two points of intersection.

alternatively, maybe i miscalculated the cartesian solution.

let me check again.

we have:

(
x
−
2
)
2
+
y
2
=
4
(x−2) 
2
 +y 
2
 =4

x
2
+
(
y
−
4
)
2
=
16
x 
2
 +(y−4) 
2
 =16

expanding:

x
2
−
4
x
+
4
+
y
2
=
4
x 
2
 −4x+4+y 
2
 =4 → 
x
2
−
4
x
+
y
2
=
0
x 
2
 −4x+y 
2
 =0 ... (1)

x
2
+
y
2
−
8
y
+
16
=
16
x 
2
 +y 
2
 −8y+16=16 → 
x
2
+
y
2
−
8
y
=
0
x 
2
 +y 
2
 −8y=0 ... (2)

subtract (1) from (2):

−
8
y
+
4
x
=
0
−8y+4x=0 → 
x
=
2
y
x=2y

substitute into (1):

(
2
y
)
2
−
4
(
2
y
)
+
y
2
=
0
(2y) 
2
 −4(2y)+y 
2
 =0 → 
4
y
2
−
8
y
+
y
2
=
0
4y 
2
 −8y+y 
2
 =0 → 
5
y
2
−
8
y
=
0
5y 
2
 −8y=0 → 
y
(
5
y
−
8
)
=
0
y(5y−8)=0

so, 
y
=
0
y=0 or 
y
=
8
5
y= 
5
8
​
 

then, 
x
=
0
x=0 or 
x
=
16
5
x= 
5
16
​
 

thus, points are (0,0) and 
(
16
5
,
8
5
)
( 
5
16
​
 , 
5
8
​
 )

now, to confirm, plug these back into both original equations.

first, (0,0):

r
=
4
cos
⁡
θ
r=4cosθ: at (0,0), 
r
=
0
r=0, which occurs when 
cos
⁡
θ
=
0
cosθ=0, i.e., 
θ
=
π
2
θ= 
2
π
​
  or 
θ
=
3
π
2
θ= 
2
3π
​
 

r
=
8
sin
⁡
θ
r=8sinθ: at (0,0), 
r
=
0
r=0, which occurs when 
sin
⁡
θ
=
0
sinθ=0, i.e., 
θ
=
0
,
π
,
2
π
θ=0,π,2π

so, the origin is indeed on both curves.

second, 
(
16
5
,
8
5
)
( 
5
16
​
 , 
5
8
​
 ):

compute 
r
=
(
16
5
)
2
+
(
8
5
)
2
=
256
25
+
64
25
=
320
25
=
12.8
=
8
5
r= 
( 
5
16
​
 ) 
2
 +( 
5
8
​
 ) 
2
 
​
 = 
25
256
​
 + 
25
64
​
 
​
 = 
25
320
​
 
​
 = 
12.8
​
 = 
5
​
 
8
​
 

compute 
θ
=
arctan
⁡
(
8
/
5
16
/
5
)
=
arctan
⁡
(
1
2
)
θ=arctan( 
16/5
8/5
​
 )=arctan( 
2
1
​
 )

now, check 
r
=
4
cos
⁡
θ
r=4cosθ:

4
cos
⁡
(
arctan
⁡
(
1
2
)
)
=
4
⋅
2
5
=
8
5
4cos(arctan( 
2
1
​
 ))=4⋅ 
5
​
 
2
​
 = 
5
​
 
8
​
 

and 
r
=
8
sin
⁡
θ
r=8sinθ:

8
sin
⁡
(
arctan
⁡
(
1
2
)
)
=
8
⋅
1
5
=
8
5
8sin(arctan( 
2
1
​
 ))=8⋅ 
5
​
 
1
​
 = 
5
​
 
8
​
 

so, both equations give the same 
r
r for this 
θ
θ, confirming the point lies on both curves.

therefore, there are two distinct points of intersection.

alternatively, perhaps i should consider that in polar coordinates, the origin is a single point, and the other intersection corresponds to one unique point, so total two points.

yes, that seems consistent.

therefore, the graphs intersect twice.
