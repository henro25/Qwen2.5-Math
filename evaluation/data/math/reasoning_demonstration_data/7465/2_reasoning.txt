Reasoning: Okay, so I have this problem here about force and wrenches. It says that the force needed to loosen a bolt varies inversely with the length of the handle of the wrench used. Hmm, I think that means that as the handle gets longer, the force needed decreases, and vice versa. So, like, if I have a longer wrench, I don't need to push as hard to get the bolt loose.

Alright, they gave me a wrench with a handle length of 9 inches that requires 375 pounds of force. And I need to find out how much force is needed if the wrench handle is 15 inches long. So, the force varies inversely with the length, which I believe means that force times length is a constant. So, F times L equals some constant k.

Let me write that down: F * L = k.

So, for the first wrench, F1 * L1 = k, which is 375 pounds times 9 inches. Let me calculate that: 375 * 9 = 3375. So, k is 3375.

Now, for the second wrench with a handle length of 15 inches, I need to find the force F2 such that F2 * 15 = 3375.

So, F2 = 3375 / 15.

Let me do that division: 3375 divided by 15. Well, 15 times 200 is 3000, and 15 times 25 is 375, so 200 plus 25 is 225. So, F2 should be 225 pounds.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If I have a longer handle, the force should be less, and indeed, 225 is less than 375, so that seems right.

Maybe I can think of it another way. The lengths are 9 inches and 15 inches. The ratio of lengths is 15/9, which simplifies to 5/3. Since force varies inversely with length, the force should be inversely proportional to that ratio. So, F2 = F1 * (L1 / L2) = 375 * (9/15) = 375 * (3/5) = 225 pounds. Yeah, that matches what I got before.

I think that's the answer. 225 pounds of force are needed for the 15-inch wrench.
