Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: the sum of two numbers is 19 and their difference is 5. i need to find their product. okay, let's see how to approach this.

first, i know that if i have two numbers, let's call them x and y, and i know their sum and difference, i can set up a system of equations. so, the sum is 19, which means:

x + y = 19

and the difference is 5, which means:

x - y = 5

now, i need to solve for x and y. there are a few ways to solve a system of equations, like substitution or elimination. i think elimination might be simpler here because the equations are already set up nicely.

if i add the two equations together:

(x + y) + (x - y) = 19 + 5

that simplifies to:

2x = 24

so, x = 12

now that i have x, i can plug it back into one of the original equations to find y. let's use the sum equation:

12 + y = 19

subtract 12 from both sides:

y = 19 - 12

y = 7

okay, so the two numbers are 12 and 7. now, the problem is asking for their product, so i need to multiply them:

12 * 7 = 84

wait a minute, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. 10*7 is 70, and 2*7 is 14, so 70 + 14 is indeed 84.

alternatively, just to confirm, i can use the difference of squares formula. i know that:

(x + y)(x - y) = x² - y²

but i'm not sure if that helps me here since i need x times y, not x² minus y².

actually, maybe i can use another approach to verify my answer. i know that if i have two numbers, their sum and product are related to the roots of a quadratic equation. specifically, if x and y are roots of the equation:

t² - (x + y)t + xy = 0

given that x + y = 19 and x - y = 5, i already have x and y, but just to explore, let's see.

from x + y = 19 and x - y = 5, i can solve for x and y as i did before, but since i already have x = 12 and y = 7, their product should be 84, as calculated.

another way could be to express y in terms of x from one equation and substitute into the other. let's try that.

from x + y = 19, i can express y as:

y = 19 - x

now, plug this into the difference equation:

x - (19 - x) = 5

simplify:

x - 19 + x = 5

2x - 19 = 5

2x = 24

x = 12

then y = 19 - 12 = 7

again, the product is 12 * 7 = 84

it seems consistent. maybe i can use algebraic identities to find the product without finding x and y individually.

i recall that:

(x + y)² = x² + 2xy + y²

and

(x - y)² = x² - 2xy + y²

if i subtract the second equation from the first:

(x + y)² - (x - y)² = 4xy

so,

19² - 5² = 4xy

calculate:

361 - 25 = 4xy

336 = 4xy

then, xy = 336 / 4 = 84

okay, that's another confirmation that the product is 84.

just to be thorough, maybe i can graph these equations and see where they intersect.

the first equation is x + y = 19, which is a straight line with a slope of -1 and y-intercept at 19.

the second equation is x - y = 5, which is a straight line with a slope of 1 and y-intercept at 5.

the point where they intersect should be the solution (12,7), which matches what i found earlier.

alternatively, if i consider the system:

x + y = 19

x - y = 5

i can solve for x by adding the two equations, as i did before, and then find y.

it seems no matter which method i use, i end up with the same answer. that gives me confidence that the product is indeed 84.

i don't think there's any other approach that would yield a different result, unless i made a mistake in my calculations. but i've checked it multiple ways, and everything points to 84.

so, the product of the two numbers is 84.

**final answer**

84
