Answer: Given the sum and difference of two numbers, we can set up the following system of equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
x + y = 19 \\
x - y = 5
\end{cases}
\]

adding these two equations:

\[
(x + y) + (x - y) = 19 + 5 \implies 2x = 24 \implies x = 12
\]

substituting \( x = 12 \) back into the sum equation:

\[
12 + y = 19 \implies y = 19 - 12 \implies y = 7
\]

the product of the two numbers is:

\[
12 \times 7 = 84
\]

to verify, we can use the identity for the product of the roots of a quadratic equation:

\[
(x + y)(x - y) = x^2 - y^2
\]

given \( x + y = 19 \) and \( x - y = 5 \):

\[
19^2 - 5^2 = 361 - 25 = 336 \implies 4xy = 336 \implies xy = \frac{336}{4} = 84
\]

thus, the product of the two numbers is:

\[
\boxed{84}
\]
