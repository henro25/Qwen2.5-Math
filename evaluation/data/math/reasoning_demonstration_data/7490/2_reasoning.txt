Reasoning: So i've got this problem here. it says:

find 
h
(
x
)
h(x), with terms in order of decreasing degree, if

9
x
3
−
3
x
+
1
+
h
(
x
)
=
3
x
2
−
5
x
+
3.
9x 
3
 −3x+1+h(x)=3x 
2
 −5x+3.
okay, so i need to find this function 
h
(
x
)
h(x). let's see, it's being added to 
9
x
3
−
3
x
+
1
9x 
3
 −3x+1 to give 
3
x
2
−
5
x
+
3
3x 
2
 −5x+3. so, to find 
h
(
x
)
h(x), i can think of it as subtracting 
9
x
3
−
3
x
+
1
9x 
3
 −3x+1 from both sides of the equation.

so, starting with the equation:

9
x
3
−
3
x
+
1
+
h
(
x
)
=
3
x
2
−
5
x
+
3.
9x 
3
 −3x+1+h(x)=3x 
2
 −5x+3.
if i subtract 
9
x
3
−
3
x
+
1
9x 
3
 −3x+1 from both sides, i should get 
h
(
x
)
h(x) by itself on the left side. let's write that down:

h
(
x
)
=
3
x
2
−
5
x
+
3
−
(
9
x
3
−
3
x
+
1
)
.
h(x)=3x 
2
 −5x+3−(9x 
3
 −3x+1).
now, i need to distribute the negative sign through the parentheses:

h
(
x
)
=
3
x
2
−
5
x
+
3
−
9
x
3
+
3
x
−
1.
h(x)=3x 
2
 −5x+3−9x 
3
 +3x−1.
wait, is that right? let me double-check the distribution. the negative sign should apply to each term inside the parentheses:

−
(
9
x
3
)
=
−
9
x
3
,
−(9x 
3
 )=−9x 
3
 ,
−
(
−
3
x
)
=
+
3
x
,
−(−3x)=+3x,
−
(
1
)
=
−
1.
−(1)=−1.
yes, that looks correct. now, let's combine like terms. i have:

−
9
x
3
+
3
x
2
+
(
−
5
x
+
3
x
)
+
(
3
−
1
)
.
−9x 
3
 +3x 
2
 +(−5x+3x)+(3−1).
simplifying each group:

−
9
x
3
+
3
x
2
−
2
x
+
2.
−9x 
3
 +3x 
2
 −2x+2.
so, 
h
(
x
)
=
−
9
x
3
+
3
x
2
−
2
x
+
2
h(x)=−9x 
3
 +3x 
2
 −2x+2.

but the problem says to write the terms in order of decreasing degree. let's see, degrees are based on the exponent of 
x
x. so, the degrees here are:

- 
−
9
x
3
−9x 
3
 : degree 3

- 
3
x
2
3x 
2
 : degree 2

- 
−
2
x
−2x: degree 1

- 
2
2: degree 0

they are already in decreasing order: 3, 2, 1, 0. so, that should be fine.

wait a second, but sometimes people prefer not to have a negative leading coefficient. is that necessary? the problem doesn't specify that, so i think it's okay.

let me just check my work again to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

starting with:

9
x
3
−
3
x
+
1
+
h
(
x
)
=
3
x
2
−
5
x
+
3.
9x 
3
 −3x+1+h(x)=3x 
2
 −5x+3.
subtract 
9
x
3
−
3
x
+
1
9x 
3
 −3x+1 from both sides:

h
(
x
)
=
3
x
2
−
5
x
+
3
−
9
x
3
+
3
x
−
1.
h(x)=3x 
2
 −5x+3−9x 
3
 +3x−1.
combine like terms:

−
9
x
3
+
3
x
2
−
2
x
+
2.
−9x 
3
 +3x 
2
 −2x+2.
seems correct.

alternatively, i could plug 
h
(
x
)
h(x) back into the original equation to verify.

so, plugging 
h
(
x
)
=
−
9
x
3
+
3
x
2
−
2
x
+
2
h(x)=−9x 
3
 +3x 
2
 −2x+2 into the left side:

9
x
3
−
3
x
+
1
+
(
−
9
x
3
+
3
x
2
−
2
x
+
2
)
=
9
x
3
−
9
x
3
+
3
x
2
−
3
x
−
2
x
+
1
+
2
=
3
x
2
−
5
x
+
3.
9x 
3
 −3x+1+(−9x 
3
 +3x 
2
 −2x+2)=9x 
3
 −9x 
3
 +3x 
2
 −3x−2x+1+2=3x 
2
 −5x+3.
yes, that matches the right side of the equation. so, my answer is correct.

i think that's all there is to it. the answer is 
h
(
x
)
=
−
9
x
3
+
3
x
2
−
2
x
+
2
h(x)=−9x 
3
 +3x 
2
 −2x+2, and it's already in decreasing order of degree.

**final answer**

−9x 
3
 +3x 
2
 −2x+2
