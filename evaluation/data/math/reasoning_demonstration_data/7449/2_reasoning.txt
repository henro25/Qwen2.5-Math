Reasoning: So i have this probability problem here. it says that 8 coins are flipped simultaneously, and i need to find the probability that at most 2 of them show heads. hmm, okay, let's break this down.

first, i need to understand what "at most 2" means. that should include the scenarios where there are 0 heads, 1 head, or 2 heads showing up. so, i need to calculate the probability for each of these cases and then add them up.

since the coins are flipped simultaneously, i assume each flip is independent, and each has an equal probability of landing heads or tails. typically, for a fair coin, the probability of heads (h) is 0.5, and the probability of tails (t) is also 0.5.

this sounds like a binomial probability problem because i'm dealing with a fixed number of independent trials (8 flips), each with two possible outcomes (heads or tails), and the probability of success (getting heads) is constant.

the formula for binomial probability is:

p
(
k
)
=
c
(
n
,
k
)
×
p
k
×
(
1
−
p
)
n
−
k
p(k)=c(n,k)×p 
k
 ×(1−p) 
n−k
 
where:

- 
n
n is the number of trials (8 in this case),

- 
k
k is the number of successes (0, 1, or 2 heads),

- 
p
p is the probability of success on a single trial (0.5 for heads),

- 
c
(
n
,
k
)
c(n,k) is the combination of 
n
n items taken 
k
k at a time.

so, i need to calculate 
p
(
0
)
+
p
(
1
)
+
p
(
2
)
p(0)+p(1)+p(2).

let me compute each one separately.

first, 
p
(
0
)
p(0):

 =1×1×(0.5) 
8
 =1×1× 
256

​	
 = 
256
1
​	
 
next, 
p
(
1
)
p(1):

p
(
1
)
=
c
(
8
,

)
×

p(1)=c(8,1)×(0.5)

 ×(0.5)

 =8×0.5×(0.5)

 =8×0.5× 
128
1
​	
 =8× 
256

​	
 = 
256

​	
 
wait, let me check that calculation again. 
(
0.5
)
7
(0.5) 
7
  is indeed 
1
128
128
1
​	
 , and multiplying by 0.5 gives 
1
256
256
1
​	
 . then, multiplying by 8 gives 
8
256
256
8
​	
 . that seems correct.

now, 
p
(
2
)
p(2):

p
(
2
)
=
c
(
8
,
2
)
×
(

64
p(2)=c(8,2)×(0.5) 
2
 ×(0.5) 
8−2
 =28×0.25×(0.5) 
6
 =28×0.25×

​	
 
let me compute that step by step. 
0.25

​	
 = 
256
1
​	
 , and then multiplying by 28 gives 
28
256
256
28
​	
 .

so, now i have:

p
(
0
)
=
1
256
p(0)= 
256
1
​	
 
p
(
1
)
=
8
256
p(1)= 
256
8
​	
 
p
(
2
)
=
28
256
p(2)= 
256
28
​	
 
adding them up:

p
(
0
)
+
p
(
1
)
+
p
(
2
)
=
1
+
8
+
28
256
=
37
256
p(0)+p(1)+p(2)= 
256
1+8+28
​	
 = 
256
37
​	
 
wait a minute, but i think i might have made a mistake here. let me double-check the combination values.

for 
c
(
8
,
0
)
c(8,0), that's 1, which is correct.

for 
c
(
8
,
1
)
c(8,1), that's 8, which is correct.

for 
c
(
8
,
2
)
c(8,2), i believe it's 28, but let me confirm:

c
(
8
,
2
)
=
8
!
2
!
(
8
−
2
)
!
=
8
×
7
2
×
1
=
28
c(8,2)= 
2!(8−2)!
8!
​	
 = 
2×1
8×7
​	
 =28
yes, that's correct.

so, the probabilities are:

p
(
0
)
=
1
256
p(0)= 
256
1
​	
 
p
(
1
)
=
8
256
p(1)= 
256
8
​	
 
p
(
2
)
=
28
256
p(2)= 
256
28
​	
 
adding them up:

1
+
8
+
28
256
=
37
256
256
1+8+28
​	
 = 
256
37
​	
 
but wait, i feel like this might not be the right approach. maybe i should consider that the total number of possible outcomes is 
2
8
=
256
2 
8
 =256, which matches the denominator i have. so, that seems consistent.

alternatively, i could think of it in terms of combinations: the number of ways to get 0 heads is 1, to get 1 head is 8, and to get 2 heads is 28, as i calculated. so, the total favorable outcomes are 
1
+
8
+
28
=
37
1+8+28=37, and the total possible outcomes are 256.

therefore, the probability is 
37
256
256
37
​	
 .

but, i recall that sometimes it's easier to use the cumulative distribution function for binomial probabilities, or perhaps use a calculator or table, but since this is a small number, doing it manually seems feasible.

wait, but i have a nagging feeling that 37 might not be correct. let me recheck the addition: 1 + 8 is 9, plus 28 is 37. that seems right.

alternatively, maybe there's a formula for the sum of binomial probabilities up to a certain k.

i know that the sum from k=0 to k=2 of 
c
(
8
,
k
)
×
(
0.5
)
8
c(8,k)×(0.5) 
8
  should give the desired probability.

alternatively, i could think about using the complement: the probability of getting more than 2 heads, which is 1 minus the probability of getting at most 2 heads. but that might not help directly here.

wait, maybe i can verify my answer by calculating the probability of getting exactly 3 heads and see if adding up to 2 makes sense.

p
(
3
)
=
c
(
8
,
3
)
×
(
0.5
)
3
×
(
0.5
)
5
=
56
×
0.125
×
0.03125
=
56
×
0.00390625
=
0.21875
p(3)=c(8,3)×(0.5) 
3
 ×(0.5) 
5
 =56×0.125×0.03125=56×0.00390625=0.21875
but i'm not sure if that helps me verify the previous calculation.

alternatively, maybe i can use the fact that the sum of all probabilities from k=0 to k=8 should be 1, which is 
∑
k
=
0
8
c
(
8
,
k
)
×
(
0.5
)
8
=
1
∑ 
k=0
8
​	
 c(8,k)×(0.5) 
8
 =1.

so, if i calculate 
37
256
256
37
​	
  for k=0,1,2, then the remaining probability for k=3 to 8 should be 
1
−
37
256
=
219
256
1− 
256
37
​	
 = 
256
219
​	
 . does that make sense?

well, 37 is less than half of 256, which is 128, so 
37
256
256
37
​	
  is approximately 0.1445, or 14.45%. that seems reasonable for the probability of getting at most 2 heads out of 8 flips.

alternatively, i can think about the symmetry of the binomial distribution when p=0.5. the distribution is symmetric around k=4, so the probability of getting less than or equal to 2 heads should be the same as getting greater than or equal to 6 heads.

but, since i'm asked for at most 2, i'll stick with my initial calculation.

therefore, i conclude that the probability is 
37
256
256
37
​	
 .

**final answer**

37
