Answer: To solve the equation

\[
\frac{r^2 - 5r + 4}{r^2 - 8r + 7} = \frac{r^2 - 2r - 15}{r^2 - r - 20},
\]

we start by factoring the quadratics in the numerators and denominators.

for the left side:
\[
r^2 - 5r + 4 = (r - 4)(r - 1),
\]
\[
r^2 - 8r + 7 = (r - 7)(r - 1).
\]

thus, the left side simplifies to:
\[
\frac{(r - 4)(r - 1)}{(r - 7)(r - 1)} = \frac{r - 4}{r - 7} \quad \text{(for } r \neq 1\text{)}.
\]

for the right side:
\[
r^2 - 2r - 15 = (r - 5)(r + 3),
\]
\[
r^2 - r - 20 = (r - 5)(r + 4).
\]

thus, the right side simplifies to:
\[
\frac{(r - 5)(r + 3)}{(r - 5)(r + 4)} = \frac{r + 3}{r + 4} \quad \text{(for } r \neq 5\text{)}.
\]

now, the equation is:
\[
\frac{r - 4}{r - 7} = \frac{r + 3}{r + 4}.
\]

cross-multiplying to eliminate the fractions, we get:
\[
(r - 4)(r + 4) = (r + 3)(r - 7).
\]

expanding both sides:
\[
r^2 - 16 = r^2 - 4r - 21.
\]

subtracting \( r^2 \) from both sides:
\[
-16 = -4r - 21.
\]

solving for \( r \):
\[
-16 + 21 = -4r,
\]
\[
5 = -4r,
\]
\[
r = -\frac{5}{4}.
\]

finally, we check that \( r = -\frac{5}{4} \) does not make any denominator zero in the original equation. it does not, so the solution is valid.

\[
\boxed{-\frac{5}{4}}
\]
