Reasoning: I've got this equation to solve:

r
2
−
5
r
+
4
r
2
−
8
r
+
7
=
r
2
−
2
r
−
15
r
2
−
r
−
20
r 
2
 −8r+7
r 
2
 −5r+4
​
 = 
r 
2
 −r−20
r 
2
 −2r−15
​
 
okay, so first things first, i need to solve for r. it's a rational equation, meaning fractions are involved. the best way to tackle this is to cross-multiply to eliminate the denominators, but i have to be careful about the values of r that would make any denominator zero because those would be restrictions on r.

so, let's factor each of the quadratics to see if anything cancels out or simplifies.

starting with the numerator on the left: 
r
2
−
5
r
+
4
r 
2
 −5r+4. i can factor this as (r - 4)(r - 1), because 4 times 1 is 4 and -4 -1 is -5.

next, the denominator on the left: 
r
2
−
8
r
+
7
r 
2
 −8r+7. factoring this, i look for two numbers that multiply to 7 and add to -8. that would be (r - 7)(r - 1).

so, the left side becomes:

(
r
−
4
)
(
r
−
1
)
(
r
−
7
)
(
r
−
1
)
(r−7)(r−1)
(r−4)(r−1)
​
 
i notice that (r - 1) appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so as long as r is not 1 (because that would make the denominator zero), i can cancel those terms out. so, the left side simplifies to:

r
−
4
r
−
7
r−7
r−4
​
 
now, let's do the same for the right side.

the numerator on the right is 
r
2
−
2
r
−
15
r 
2
 −2r−15. factoring this, i look for two numbers that multiply to -15 and add to -2. that would be (r - 5)(r + 3).

the denominator on the right is 
r
2
−
r
−
20
r 
2
 −r−20. factoring this, i look for two numbers that multiply to -20 and add to -1. that would be (r - 5)(r + 4).

so, the right side becomes:

(
r
−
5
)
(
r
+
3
)
(
r
−
5
)
(
r
+
4
)
(r−5)(r+4)
(r−5)(r+3)
​
 
again, (r - 5) appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so as long as r is not 5, i can cancel those terms out. so, the right side simplifies to:

r
+
3
r
+
4
r+4
r+3
​
 
now, the equation is simplified to:

r
−
4
r
−
7
=
r
+
3
r
+
4
r−7
r−4
​
 = 
r+4
r+3
​
 
alright, now i can cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:

(
r
−
4
)
(
r
+
4
)
=
(
r
+
3
)
(
r
−
7
)
(r−4)(r+4)=(r+3)(r−7)
let's expand both sides.

left side: 
(
r
−
4
)
(
r
+
4
)
=
r
2
+
4
r
−
4
r
−
16
=
r
2
−
16
(r−4)(r+4)=r 
2
 +4r−4r−16=r 
2
 −16

right side: 
(
r
+
3
)
(
r
−
7
)
=
r
2
−
7
r
+
3
r
−
21
=
r
2
−
4
r
−
21
(r+3)(r−7)=r 
2
 −7r+3r−21=r 
2
 −4r−21

so, the equation is now:

r
2
−
16
=
r
2
−
4
r
−
21
r 
2
 −16=r 
2
 −4r−21
hmm, i can subtract 
r
2
r 
2
  from both sides to simplify:

−
16
=
−
4
r
−
21
−16=−4r−21
now, let's solve for r. first, add 21 to both sides:

−
16
+
21
=
−
4
r
−16+21=−4r
5
=
−
4
r
5=−4r
now, divide both sides by -4:

r
=
−
5
4
r=− 
4
5
​
 
wait a minute, i should check if this value of r makes any denominator zero in the original equation. let's plug r = -5/4 into each denominator:

first denominator: 
r
2
−
8
r
+
7
r 
2
 −8r+7

plugging in r = -5/4:

(
−
5
4
)
2
−
8
(
−
5
4
)
+
7
=
25
16
+
10
+
7
=
25
16
+
17
=

(−

​
 )

 −8(− 
4
5
​
 )+7= 
16
25
​
 +10+7= 
16
25
​
 +17=not zero
second denominator: 
r
2
−
r
−
20
r 
2
 −r−20

plugging in r = -5/4:

(
−
5
4
)
2
−
(
−
5
4
)
−
20
=
25
16
+
5
4
−
20
=
25
16
+
20
16
−
320
16
=
45
−
320
16
=
−
275
16

0
(−

​
 ) 
2
 −(−

​
 )−20=

​
 −20=

​

​
 − 
16
320
​
 = 
16
45−320
​
 = 
16
−275
​
 

=0
so, r = -5/4 is a valid solution.

i think that's it. to recap:

1. factored and simplified both sides of the equation.

2. cross-multiplied to eliminate denominators.

3. solved the resulting linear equation.

4. checked that the solution doesn't make any denominator zero.

everything seems to check out.

**final answer**
