Problem: A circle with center $O$ has radius $8$ units and circle $P$ has radius $2$ units.  The circles are externally tangent to each other at point $Q$.  Segment $TS$ is the common external tangent to circle $O$ and circle $P$ at points $T$ and $S$, respectively.  What is the length of segment $OS$?  Express your answer in simplest radical form.
