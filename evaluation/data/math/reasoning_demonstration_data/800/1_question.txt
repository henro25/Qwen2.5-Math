Problem: Rationalize the denominator of $\displaystyle \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{7}}$, and write your answer in the form \[
\frac{A\sqrt{2} + B\sqrt{3} + C\sqrt{7} + D\sqrt{E}}{F},
\]where everything is in simplest radical form and the fraction is in lowest terms, and $F$ is positive. What is $A + B + C + D + E + F$?
