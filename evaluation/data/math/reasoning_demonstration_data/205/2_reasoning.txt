Reasoning: So i have this problem here. it says that there are three positive numbers x, y, and z that satisfy three equations:

1. 
x
y
z
=
1
xyz=1

2. 
x
+
1
z
=
5
x+ 
z
1
​
 =5

3. 
y
+
1
x
=
29
y+ 
x
1
​
 =29

and i need to find 
z
+
1
y
z+ 
y
1
​
 .

alright, let's see. first, since all variables are positive, i don't have to worry about negative values or anything like that.

the first equation is 
x
y
z
=
1
xyz=1. maybe i can express one variable in terms of the others using this equation.

let's try to solve for z from the first equation:

z
=
1
x
y
z= 
xy
1
​
 

okay, now i can substitute this expression for z into the second equation.

the second equation is 
x
+
1
z
=
5
x+ 
z
1
​
 =5.

substituting z:

x
+
1
1
x
y
=
5
x+ 
xy
1
​
 
1
​
 =5

simplify the fraction:

x
+
x
y
=
5
x+xy=5

hmm, that's interesting. so, 
x
(
1
+
y
)
=
5
x(1+y)=5

wait, i can write that as 
x
(
1
+
y
)
=
5
x(1+y)=5. maybe i can solve for x in terms of y.

x
=
5
1
+
y
x= 
1+y
5
​
 

alright, now i have x in terms of y.

now, look at the third equation: 
y
+
1
x
=
29
y+ 
x
1
​
 =29

i can substitute x from above into this equation.

first, find 
1
x
x
1
​
 :

1
x
=
1
+
y
5
x
1
​
 = 
5
1+y
​
 

so, the third equation becomes:

y
+
1
+
y
5
=
29
y+ 
5
1+y
​
 =29

let's solve for y.

multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the denominator:

5
y
+
1
+
y
=
145
5y+1+y=145

combine like terms:

6
y
+
1
=
145
6y+1=145

subtract 1 from both sides:

6
y
=
144
6y=144

divide by 6:

y
=
24
y=24

okay, so y is 24.

now, plug y back into the expression for x:

x
=
5
1
+
24
=
5
25
=
1
5
x= 
1+24
5
​
 = 
25
5
​
 = 
5
1
​
 

so, x is 
1
5
5
1
​
 .

now, recall that 
z
=
1
x
y
z= 
xy
1
​
 . plug in x and y:

z
=
1
(
1
5
)
×
24
=
1
24
5
=
5
24
z= 
( 
5
1
​
 )×24
1
​
 = 
5
24
​
 
1
​
 = 
24
5
​
 

so, z is 
5
24
24
5
​
 .

now, i need to find 
z
+
1
y
z+ 
y
1
​
 .

first, find 
1
y
y
1
​
 :

1
y
=
1
24
y
1
​
 = 
24
1
​
 

so, 
z
+
1
y
=
5
24
+
1
24
=
6
24
=
1
4
z+ 
y
1
​
 = 
24
5
​
 + 
24
1
​
 = 
24
6
​
 = 
4
1
​
 

wait a minute, that seems straightforward. did i miss something?

let me double-check the calculations.

starting from 
x
+
1
z
=
5
x+ 
z
1
​
 =5, with 
z
=
1
x
y
z= 
xy
1
​
 , i substituted and got 
x
+
x
y
=
5
x+xy=5, which led to 
x
(
1
+
y
)
=
5
x(1+y)=5, and hence 
x
=
5
1
+
y
x= 
1+y
5
​
 .

then, in the third equation 
y
+
1
x
=
29
y+ 
x
1
​
 =29, substituting 
x
=
5
1
+
y
x= 
1+y
5
​
 , i found 
1
x
=
1
+
y
5
x
1
​
 = 
5
1+y
​
 , and so 
y
+
1
+
y
5
=
29
y+ 
5
1+y
​
 =29, leading to 
6
y
+
1
=
145
6y+1=145, hence 
y
=
24
y=24.

then, 
x
=
5
25
=
1
5
x= 
25
5
​
 = 
5
1
​
 , and 
z
=
1
x
y
=
1
1
5
×
24
=
5
24
z= 
xy
1
​
 = 
5
1
​
 ×24
1
​
 = 
24
5
​
 .

finally, 
z
+
1
y
=
5
24
+
1
24
=
6
24
=
1
4
z+ 
y
1
​
 = 
24
5
​
 + 
24
1
​
 = 
24
6
​
 = 
4
1
​
 .

everything seems to check out.

i think that's the answer.

**final answer**

1
4
