Problem: Laura is training for a triathlon, but she doesn't feel like swimming. She bikes $20$ miles at $2x+1$ miles per hour, spends five minutes parking her bike, changing to her running shoes, and catching a drink of water, and then runs $5$ miles at $x$ miles per hour. Her total workout lasts $110$ minutes. How fast did Laura run, to the nearest hundredth of a mile per hour?  (You may use a calculator on this problem.)
