Problem: A $100$-gon $P_1$ is drawn in the Cartesian plane.  The sum of the $x$-coordinates of the $100$ vertices equals 2009.  The midpoints of the sides of $P_1$ form a second $100$-gon, $P_2$.  Finally, the midpoints of the sides of $P_2$ form a third $100$-gon, $P_3$.  Find the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_3$.
