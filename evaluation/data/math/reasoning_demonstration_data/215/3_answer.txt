Answer: Given triangle \(abc\) with \(ab = 1\), \(ac = 2\), and the median from \(a\) to \(bc\) equal in length to \(bc\), we need to find the length of \(bc\).

first, we use apollonius's theorem, which states:
\[
ab^2 + ac^2 = 2ad^2 + 2(bd^2)
\]
where \(d\) is the midpoint of \(bc\), and \(ad = bc = x\), \(bd = \frac{x}{2}\).

plugging in the given values:
\[
1^2 + 2^2 = 2x^2 + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2
\]
\[
1 + 4 = 2x^2 + 2\left(\frac{x^2}{4}\right)
\]
\[
5 = 2x^2 + \frac{x^2}{2}
\]
combining like terms:
\[
5 = \frac{4x^2}{2} + \frac{x^2}{2} = \frac{5x^2}{2}
\]
solving for \(x^2\):
\[
5 = \frac{5x^2}{2} \implies 10 = 5x^2 \implies x^2 = 2 \implies x = \sqrt{2}
\]

thus, the length of \(bc\) is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{2}}
\]
