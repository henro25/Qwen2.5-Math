Reasoning: Let's see. i have this equation to solve: 
1
+
2
+
x
=
1
+
x
3
1+ 
2+ 
x
​	
 
​	
 
​	
 = 
3
  
1+ 
x
​	
 
​	
 . hmm, that looks pretty complicated with all those nested radicals and different roots. i need to find the value of 
x
x that satisfies this equation.

first, i should probably try to simplify this equation somehow. maybe i can start by letting 
y
=
x
y= 
x
​	
 , which would make the equation a bit easier to handle. so, if 
y
=
x
y= 
x
​	
 , then 
x
=
y
2
x=y 
2
 . substituting that in, the equation becomes:

1
+
2
+
y
=
1
+
y
3
1+ 
2+y
​	
 
​	
 = 
3
  
1+y
​	
 
okay, that's a bit simpler. now, i have an equation with 
y
y, and i need to solve for 
y
y, and then i can find 
x
x by squaring 
y
y.

next, i should consider getting rid of the radicals. since there's a square root on the left and a cube root on the right, it might be tricky. maybe i can square both sides to eliminate the square root on the left. let's try that:

(
1
+
2
+
y
)
2
=
(
1
+
y
3
)
2
( 
1+ 
2+y
​	
 
​	
 ) 
2
 =( 
3
  
1+y
​	
 ) 
2
 
which simplifies to:

1
+
2
+
y
=
(
1
+
y
3
)
2
1+ 
2+y
​	
 =( 
3
  
1+y
​	
 ) 
2
 
hmm, that still leaves me with a square root and a cube root in the equation. maybe i can isolate the square root term first. let's subtract 1 from both sides:

2
+
y
=
(
1
+
y
3
)
2
−
1
2+y
​	
 =( 
3
  
1+y
​	
 ) 
2
 −1
now, to eliminate the square root on the left, i can square both sides again:

(
2
+
y
)
2
=
(
(
1
+
y
3
)
2
−
1
)
2
( 
2+y
​	
 ) 
2
 =(( 
3
  
1+y
​	
 ) 
2
 −1) 
2
 
which simplifies to:

2
+
y
=
(
(
1
+
y
3
)
2
−
1
)
2
2+y=(( 
3
  
1+y
​	
 ) 
2
 −1) 
2
 
this still looks pretty messy. maybe i should consider a different approach. perhaps i can let 
z
=
1
+
y
3
z= 
3
  
1+y
​	
 , which would make 
z
3
=
1
+
y
z 
3
 =1+y, or 
y
=
z
3
−
1
y=z 
3
 −1. let's try substituting that in.

first, express 
y
y in terms of 
z
z:

y
=
z
3
−
1
y=z 
3
 −1
now, substitute back into the equation 
2
+
y
=
(
z
2
−
1
)
2
2+y=(z 
2
 −1) 
2
 :

2
+
(
z
3
−
1
)
=
(
z
2
−
1
)
2
2+(z 
3
 −1)=(z 
2
 −1) 
2
 
simplify the left side:

z
3
+
1
=
(
z
2
−
1
)
2
z 
3
 +1=(z 
2
 −1) 
2
 
now, expand the right side:

z
3
+
1
=
z
4
−
2
z
2
+
1
z 
3
 +1=z 
4
 −2z 
2
 +1
let's bring all terms to one side:

z
4
−
2
z
2
+
1
−
z
3
−
1
=
0
z 
4
 −2z 
2
 +1−z 
3
 −1=0
simplify:

z
4
−
z
3
−
2
z
2
=
0
z 
4
 −z 
3
 −2z 
2
 =0
factor out a 
z
2
z 
2
 :

z
2
(
z
2
−
z
−
2
)
=
0
z 
2
 (z 
2
 −z−2)=0
so, either 
z
2
=
0
z 
2
 =0 or 
z
2
−
z
−
2
=
0
z 
2
 −z−2=0.

if 
z
2
=
0
z 
2
 =0, then 
z
=
0
z=0. but if 
z
=
0
z=0, then 
y
=
z
3
−
1
=
−
1
y=z 
3
 −1=−1, which would make 
2
+
y
=
2
−
1
=
1
=
1
2+y
​	
 = 
2−1
​	
 = 
1
​	
 =1, and 
1
+
y
3
=
0
3
3
  
1+y
​	
 = 
3
  
0
​	
 , which is 0. plugging back into the original equation:

1
+
1
=
0
3
  
⟹
  
2
=
0
1+1
​	
 = 
3
  
0
​	
 ⟹ 
2
​	
 =0
that's not true, so 
z
=
0
z=0 is not a valid solution.

now, solve 
z
2
−
z
−
2
=
0
z 
2
 −z−2=0. using the quadratic formula:

z
=
1
±
1
+
8
2
=
1
±
3
2
z= 
2
1± 
1+8
​	
 
​	
 = 
2
1±3
​	
 
so, 
z
=
2
z=2 or 
z
=
−
1
z=−1.

first, 
z
=
2
z=2:

then, 
y
=
z
3
−
1
=
8
−
1
=
7
y=z 
3
 −1=8−1=7.

now, check if this satisfies the original equation:

1
+
2
+
x
=
1
+
x
3
1+ 
2+ 
x
​	
 
​	
 
​	
 = 
3
  
1+ 
x
​	
 
​	
 
but since 
y
=
x
=
7
y= 
x
​	
 =7, then 
x
=
49
x=49.

let's plug 
x
=
49
x=49 back into the original equation:

left side:

1
+
2
+
49
=
1
+
2
+
7
=
1
+
9
=
1
+
3
=
4
=
2
1+ 
2+ 
49
​	
 
​	
 
​	
 = 
1+ 
2+7
​	
 
​	
 = 
1+ 
9
​	
 
​	
 = 
1+3
​	
 = 
4
​	
 =2
right side:

1
+
49
3
=
1
+
7
3
=
8
3
=
2
3
  
1+ 
49
​	
 
​	
 = 
3
  
1+7
​	
 = 
3
  
8
​	
 =2
both sides are equal, so 
x
=
49
x=49 is a valid solution.

now, check 
z
=
−
1
z=−1:

then, 
y
=
z
3
−
1
=
−
1
−
1
=
−
2
y=z 
3
 −1=−1−1=−2.

but 
y
=
x
y= 
x
​	
 , and square roots are non-negative, so 
y
=
−
2
y=−2 is not possible. therefore, 
z
=
−
1
z=−1 is not a valid solution.

so, the only valid solution is 
x
=
49
x=49.

let me see if there are any other possible solutions i might have missed. maybe i should consider if there are other ways to approach this problem, like raising both sides to a higher power from the beginning.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider substituting 
u
=
x
u= 
x
​	
 , similar to what i did earlier, but let's try that again for thoroughness.

let 
u
=
x
u= 
x
​	
 , so 
x
=
u
2
x=u 
2
 .

then, the original equation becomes:

1
+
2
+
u
=
1
+
u
3
1+ 
2+u
​	
 
​	
 = 
3
  
1+u
​	
 
this is similar to what i had before. maybe i can raise both sides to the 6th power to eliminate both the square root and the cube root, since 6 is the least common multiple of 2 and 3.

so, raise both sides to the 6th power:

(
1
+
2
+
u
)
6
=
(
1
+
u
3
)
6
( 
1+ 
2+u
​	
 
​	
 ) 
6
 =( 
3
  
1+u
​	
 ) 
6
 
simplify:

(
1
+
2
+
u
)
3
=
(
1
+
u
)
2
(1+ 
2+u
​	
 ) 
3
 =(1+u) 
2
 
now, expand the left side:

(
1
+
2
+
u
)
3
=
1
+
3
2
+
u
+
3
(
2
+
u
)
+
(
2
+
u
)
3
(1+ 
2+u
​	
 ) 
3
 =1+3 
2+u
​	
 +3(2+u)+( 
2+u
​	
 ) 
3
 
wait, that seems complicated. maybe there's a better way to expand it. let's recall the binomial expansion for 
(
a
+
b
)
3
=
a
3
+
3
a
2
b
+
3
a
b
2
+
b
3
(a+b) 
3
 =a 
3
 +3a 
2
 b+3ab 
2
 +b 
3
 .

so, applying that:

(
1
+
2
+
u
)
3
=
1
3
+
3
(
1
)
2
2
+
u
+
3
(
1
)
(
2
+
u
)
2
+
(
2
+
u
)
3
(1+ 
2+u
​	
 ) 
3
 =1 
3
 +3(1) 
2
  
2+u
​	
 +3(1)( 
2+u
​	
 ) 
2
 +( 
2+u
​	
 ) 
3
 
simplify each term:

=
1
+
3
2
+
u
+
3
(
2
+
u
)
+
(
2
+
u
)
3
/
2
=1+3 
2+u
​	
 +3(2+u)+(2+u) 
3/2
 
this still looks messy. maybe expanding isn't the best approach here.

perhaps instead of raising both sides to the 6th power immediately, i should consider isolating one of the radicals first.

let me try another approach: let’s assume that both sides are equal, and perhaps there is a simple value for 
u
u that satisfies the equation.

we already found that 
u
=
7
u=7 works, as 
x
=
49
x=49. are there any other integer values of 
u
u that could work?

let’s try

we already know that 
u
=
7
u=7 works, as 
x
=
49
x=49.

maybe there are non-integer solutions as well. to check, perhaps i should graph both sides of the equation and see where they intersect.

alternatively, i can consider the behavior of both sides as functions of 
u
u.

let’s define:

f
(
u
)
=
1
+
2
+
u
f(u)= 
1+ 
2+u
​	
 
​	
 
g
(
u
)
=
1
+
u
3
g(u)= 
3
  
1+u
​	
 
i can analyze the behavior of these functions to see if there are multiple points of intersection.

first, for 
u
≥
0
u≥0, since 
u
=
x
u= 
x
​	
 , and 
x
≥
0
x≥0.

compute the derivatives to see how they behave.

compute 
f

(
u
)
f

 (u):

f
(

)
=

u
=
(

(
2

)
1
/

)
1
/

f(u)= 
1+ 
2+u
​	
 
​	
 =(1+(2+u) 
1/2
 ) 
1/2
 
first derivative:

f
′
(
u
)
=
1
2
(
1
+
(

+
u
)

/

 (2+u) 
−1/2
 
this is always positive for 
u
≥
−
2
u≥−2, so 
f
(
u
)
f(u) is increasing.

similarly, 
g
(
u
)
=
(
1
+
u
)
1
/
3
g(u)=(1+u) 
1/3
 , whose derivative is:

g

(

(

−

g

 (u)=

1
​	
 (1+u) 
−2/3
 
also positive for 
u
≥
−
1
u≥−1, so 
g
(
u
)
g(u) is also increasing.

since both functions are increasing, and we have found one intersection point at 
u
=
7
u=7, it's likely that this is the only solution.

to confirm, let's check the behavior as 
u
u approaches infinity.

as 
u
→
∞
u→∞:

f
(
u
)
=
1
+
2
+
u
≈
u
=

f(u)=

g
(

=

)
1
/

≈
u
1
/
3
g(u)=(1+u) 
1/3
 ≈u 
1/3
 
since 
1
/
4
<
1
/
3
1/4<1/3, 
f
(
u
)
f(u) grows slower than 
g
(
u
)
g(u) as 
u
u increases. therefore, after 
u
=
7
u=7, 
g
(
u
)
g(u) will eventually surpass 
f
(
u
)
f(u), but since both are increasing, and 
f
(
u
)
f(u) was less than 
g
(
u
)
g(u) at 
u
=
7
u=7, but equal at 
u
=
7
u=7, it suggests that 
u
=
7
u=7 is the only point where they intersect.

alternatively, consider the difference 
f
(
u
)
−
g
(
u
)
f(u)−g(u). since both are increasing, and they cross at 
u
=
7
u=7, with 
f
(
u
)
f(u) increasing slower than 
g
(
u
)
g(u), 
f
(
u
)
−
g
(
u
)
f(u)−g(u) will be positive before 
u
=
7
u=7 and negative after 
u
=
7
u=7, implying only one solution at 
u
=
7
u=7.

therefore, the only solution is 
x
=
49
x=49.

just to be thorough, let's check if there could be any solutions for 
u
<
0
u<0, even though 
u
=
x
u= 
x
​	
  should be non-negative. however, mathematically, if 
u
u were negative, we'd have to consider the definition of the square root and cube root functions.

let’s try 
u
=
−
0.5
u=−0.5:

therefore, no solutions for

u<0.

hence, the only solution is 
x

x=49.

**final answer**
