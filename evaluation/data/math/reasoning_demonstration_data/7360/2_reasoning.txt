Reasoning: So i have this problem: i need to find the value of 
a
3
+
b
3
a 
3
 +b 
3
  given that 
a
+
b
=
10
a+b=10 and 
a
b
=
17
ab=17. hmm, i remember there are some formulas that relate sums and products of variables to their powers. let me try to recall them.

first, i know that 
(
a
+
b
)
3
=
a
3
+
b
3
+
3
a
b
(
a
+
b
)
(a+b) 
3
 =a 
3
 +b 
3
 +3ab(a+b). maybe i can use this to find 
a
3
+
b
3
a 
3
 +b 
3
 . let's see:

given 
a
+
b
=
10
a+b=10 and 
a
b
=
17
ab=17, plugging into the formula:

(
10
)
3
=
a
3
+
b
3
+
3
×
17
×
10
(10) 
3
 =a 
3
 +b 
3
 +3×17×10

so, 
1000
=
a
3
+
b
3
+
510
1000=a 
3
 +b 
3
 +510

now, to solve for 
a
3
+
b
3
a 
3
 +b 
3
 , i can subtract 510 from both sides:

a
3
+
b
3
=
1000
−
510
=
490
a 
3
 +b 
3
 =1000−510=490

wait, is that it? it seems straightforward. but let me double-check if there's another way to approach this, just to be sure.

another way i remember is using the formula for the sum of cubes: 
a
3
+
b
3
=
(
a
+
b
)
(
a
2
−
a
b
+
b
2
)
a 
3
 +b 
3
 =(a+b)(a 
2
 −ab+b 
2
 ). do i know 
a
2
+
b
2
a 
2
 +b 
2
 ?

i can find 
a
2
+
b
2
a 
2
 +b 
2
  using the identity 
(
a
+
b
)
2
=
a
2
+
2
a
b
+
b
2
(a+b) 
2
 =a 
2
 +2ab+b 
2
 .

given 
a
+
b
=
10
a+b=10 and 
a
b
=
17
ab=17, then:

(
10
)
2
=
a
2
+
2
×
17
+
b
2
(10) 
2
 =a 
2
 +2×17+b 
2
 

100
=
a
2
+
34
+
b
2
100=a 
2
 +34+b 
2
 

so, 
a
2
+
b
2
=
100
−
34
=
66
a 
2
 +b 
2
 =100−34=66

now, plugging back into the sum of cubes formula:

a
3
+
b
3
=
(
10
)
(
66
−
17
)
=
10
×
49
=
490
a 
3
 +b 
3
 =(10)(66−17)=10×49=490

okay, i get the same answer using a different method. that makes me more confident that 490 is the correct answer.

is there anything else i should consider? maybe check if there are specific values of a and b that satisfy 
a
+
b
=
10
a+b=10 and 
a
b
=
17
ab=17, and then compute 
a
3
+
b
3
a 
3
 +b 
3
  directly to verify.

let's solve for a and b. we have a quadratic equation: 
x
2
−
(
a
+
b
)
x
+
a
b
=
0
x 
2
 −(a+b)x+ab=0, which is 
x
2
−
10
x
+
17
=
0
x 
2
 −10x+17=0.

using the quadratic formula:

x
=
10
±
100
−
68
2
=
10
±
32
2
=
10
±
4
2
2
=
5
±
2
2
x= 
2
10± 
100−68
​	
 
​	
 = 
2
10± 
32
​	
 
​	
 = 
2
10±4 
2
​	
 
​	
 =5±2 
2
​	
 

so, 
a
=
5
+
2
2
a=5+2 
2
​	
  and 
b
=
5
−
2
2
b=5−2 
2
​	
 

now, let's compute 
a
3
+
b
3
a 
3
 +b 
3
 :

first, find 
a
3
a

 :

​	
 

=
125
+
150
2
+
120
+
16
2
=125+150 
2
​	
 +120+16 
2
​	
 

=
245
+
166
2
=245+166 
2
​	
 

similarly, 
b
3
=
(
5
−
2
2
)
3
=
125
−
150
2
+
120
−
16
2
=
245
−
166
2
b 
3
 =(5−2 
2
​	
 ) 
3
 =125−150 
2
​	
 +120−16 
2
​	
 =245−166 
2
​	
 

now, 
a
3
+
b
3
=
(
245
+
166
2
)
+
(
245
−
166
2
)
=
490
a 
3
 +b 
3
 =(245+166 
2
​	
 )+(245−166 
2
​	
 )=490

again, i get 490. this triple-checking is reassuring.

alternatively, i could consider using the fact that for polynomials, if a and b are roots of 
x
2
−
10
x
+
17
=
0
x 
2
 −10x+17=0, then newton's identities relate the sums of powers of roots to the coefficients of the polynomial.

the first newton's identity: 
p
1
=
a
+
b
=
10
p 
1
​	
 =a+b=10

second: 
p
2
=
a
2
+
b
2
=
(
a
+
b
)
2
−
2
a
b
=
100
−
34
=
66
p 
2
​	
 =a 
2
 +b 
2
 =(a+b) 
2
 −2ab=100−34=66

third: 
p
3
=
a
3
+
b
3
=
(
a
+
b
)
p
2
−
a
b
p
1
=
10
×
66
−
17
×
10
=
660
−
170
=
490
p 
3
​	
 =a 
3
 +b 
3
 =(a+b)p 
2
​	
 −abp 
1
​	
 =10×66−17×10=660−170=490

once again, i arrive at 490.

i think i've verified this in multiple ways now: using the expansion of 
(
a
+
b
)
3
(a+b) 
3
 , directly applying the sum of cubes formula after finding 
a
2
+
b
2
a 
2
 +b 
2
 , solving for a and b explicitly and computing 
a
3
+
b
3
a 
3
 +b 
3
 , and using newton's identities.

therefore, i'm confident that the value of 
a
3
+
b
3
a 
3
 +b 
3
  is 490.

**final answer**

490
