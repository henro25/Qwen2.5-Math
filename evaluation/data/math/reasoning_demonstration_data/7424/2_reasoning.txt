Reasoning: I've got this equation to solve: the fifth root of (x times the square root of x cubed) equals 3. so, in symbols, that's √[5]{x√(x³)} = 3. hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but i think i can break it down step by step.

first, i need to understand what the fifth root means. the fifth root of a number is a value that, when raised to the power of 5, gives the original number. so, if √[5]{a} = b, then b^5 = a. applying that here, if √[5]{x√(x³)} = 3, then 3^5 should equal x√(x³).

let me write that down: 3^5 = x√(x³).

now, 3^5 is 243, because 3 times 3 is 9, times 3 is 27, times 3 is 81, times 3 is 243. so, 243 = x√(x³).

next, i need to simplify the right side of the equation: x times the square root of x cubed. the square root of x cubed is the same as x^(3/2), because square root is the same as raising to the 1/2 power. so, √(x³) = x^(3/2).

therefore, the equation becomes: 243 = x * x^(3/2).

now, when you multiply variables with exponents, you add the exponents if the base is the same. so, x * x^(3/2) is x^(1 + 3/2), which is x^(5/2).

so, now i have 243 = x^(5/2).

to solve for x, i need to get rid of the exponent 5/2. to do that, i can raise both sides of the equation to the reciprocal of 5/2, which is 2/5. that way, (x^(5/2))^(2/5) = x^( (5/2)*(2/5) ) = x^1 = x.

so, raising both sides to the 2/5 power: (243)^(2/5) = x.

now, i need to compute 243 raised to the 2/5 power. to simplify this, i can first find the fifth root of 243 and then square it.

the fifth root of 243 is the number that, when raised to the fifth power, equals 243. since 3^5 is 243, the fifth root of 243 is 3.

so, (243)^(1/5) = 3.

then, (243)^(2/5) = [ (243)^(1/5) ]^2 = 3^2 = 9.

therefore, x = 9.

let me check if this makes sense by plugging it back into the original equation.

first, find x√(x³) when x = 9.

x³ = 9^3 = 729.

then, √(x³) = √729 = 27.

so, x√(x³) = 9 * 27 = 243.

now, the fifth root of 243 is 3, which matches the original equation.

therefore, x = 9 is the correct solution.

wait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? maybe by expressing everything with exponents from the start.

let's try that.

we have √[5]{x√(x³)} = 3.

expressing the fifth root as an exponent: [x * (x³)^(1/2)]^(1/5) = 3.

simplify the exponent inside: (x³)^(1/2) = x^(3/2).

so, [x * x^(3/2)]^(1/5) = 3.

combine the exponents: x^(1 + 3/2) = x^(5/2).

so, [x^(5/2)]^(1/5) = x^( (5/2)*(1/5) ) = x^(1/2).

wait, that doesn't seem right. let me check that again.

actually, [x^(5/2)]^(1/5) = x^( (5/2)*(1/5) ) = x^(1/2), which is the square root of x.

but according to the original equation, this should equal 3.

so, √x = 3.

then, to solve for x, i square both sides: (√x)^2 = 3^2 ⇒ x = 9.

that's the same answer i got earlier. good, it confirms that x = 9 is correct.

i think i've got it now. the solution is x = 9.

**final answer**

9
