Answer: To determine the value of \( x \) that satisfies \(\sqrt[5]{x\sqrt{x^3}} = 3\), we start by expressing the equation in terms of exponents:

\[
\sqrt[5]{x \sqrt{x^3}} = 3
\]

this can be rewritten as:

\[
(x \cdot (x^3)^{1/2})^{1/5} = 3
\]

simplifying inside the root:

\[
(x \cdot x^{3/2})^{1/5} = 3
\]

combining the exponents:

\[
(x^{1 + 3/2})^{1/5} = 3 \implies (x^{5/2})^{1/5} = 3
\]

this simplifies to:

\[
x^{1/2} = 3
\]

to solve for \( x \), we square both sides:

\[
(x^{1/2})^2 = 3^2 \implies x = 9
\]

thus, the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation is:

\[
\boxed{9}
\]
