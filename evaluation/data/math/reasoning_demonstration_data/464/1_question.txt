Problem: Suppose the function $f(x)$ is defined on the domain $\{x_1,x_2,x_3\}$, so that the graph of $y=f(x)$ consists of just three points. Suppose those three points form a triangle of area $32$.

The graph of $y = 2f(2x)$ also consists of just three points. What is the area of the triangle formed by those three points?
