Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: a star b is defined as the square root of (a + b) divided by the square root of (a - b), and it's given that x star 24 equals 7. i need to find x. alright, let's break this down step by step.

first, i need to understand what this star operation means. it says a star b is equal to sqrt(a + b) over sqrt(a - b). so, for x star 24, that would be sqrt(x + 24) divided by sqrt(x - 24), and that equals 7.

so, the equation is:

x
+
24
x
−
24
=
7
x−24
​	
 
x+24
​	
 
​	
 =7
i need to solve for x. hmm, to get rid of the square roots in the denominator, maybe i can square both sides of the equation. that should simplify things.

squaring both sides:

(
x
+
24
x
−
24
)
2
=
7
2
( 
x−24
​	
 
x+24
​	
 
​	
 ) 
2
 =7 
2
 
which simplifies to:

x
+
24
x
−
24
=
49
x−24
x+24
​	
 =49
alright, now i have a rational equation. to solve for x, i can cross-multiply.

so,

x
+
24
=
49
(
x
−
24
)
x+24=49(x−24)
let's distribute the 49 on the right side:

x
+
24
=
49
x
−
1176
x+24=49x−1176
now, i want to get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other. let's subtract x from both sides:

24
=
48
x
−
1176
24=48x−1176
then, add 1176 to both sides:

24
+
1176
=
48
x
24+1176=48x
1200
=
48
x
1200=48x
now, divide both sides by 48 to solve for x:

x
=
1200
48
x= 
48
1200
​	
 
let me simplify that. 1200 divided by 48 is equal to 25.

wait a minute, 48 times 25 is 1200, so that checks out.

but, i should verify if this solution is valid in the original equation, because sometimes when you square both sides of an equation, you can introduce extraneous solutions.

so, let's plug x = 25 back into the original star operation.

first, calculate x + 24:

25 + 24 = 49

then, x - 24:

25 - 24 = 1

now, sqrt(49) is 7, and sqrt(1) is 1.

so, the expression becomes:

7 / 1 = 7

which matches the given equation x star 24 = 7. so, x = 25 is indeed the correct solution.

wait, but i feel like i should check if there are any restrictions on the values of a and b in the star operation. specifically, the denominators and the expressions inside the square roots must be valid.

first, the denominator sqrt(x - 24) must not be zero, so x - 24 cannot be zero, meaning x cannot be 24.

also, the expressions inside the square roots must be non-negative because you can't take the square root of a negative number in real numbers.

so, x + 24 >= 0 and x - 24 >= 0

which implies x >= -24 and x >= 24

since x >= 24 is the stricter condition, x must be greater than or equal to 24.

in our solution, x = 25, which is greater than 24, so that's fine.

is there any other possible solution? let's think about it.

when i squared both sides of the equation, i might have introduced an extraneous solution, but in this case, it seems like x = 25 is the only valid solution.

just to be thorough, let's consider if there could be another value of x that satisfies the original equation.

suppose there's another x that makes sqrt(x + 24)/sqrt(x - 24) = 7.

but from the steps above, after squaring, we only get x = 25 as a solution, and it checks out in the original equation.

therefore, x = 25 is the only solution.

so, the final answer is x = 25.

**final answer**

25
