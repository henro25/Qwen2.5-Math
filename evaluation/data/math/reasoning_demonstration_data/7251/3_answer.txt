Answer: Given the operation \( a \star b = \frac{\sqrt{a+b}}{\sqrt{a-b}} \), we need to find \( x \) such that \( x \star 24 = 7 \).

starting with the equation:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{x + 24}}{\sqrt{x - 24}} = 7
\]

we square both sides to eliminate the square roots:

\[
\left( \frac{\sqrt{x + 24}}{\sqrt{x - 24}} \right)^2 = 7^2
\]

this simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x + 24}{x - 24} = 49
\]

next, we solve the rational equation by cross-multiplying:

\[
x + 24 = 49(x - 24)
\]

distributing the 49 on the right side:

\[
x + 24 = 49x - 1176
\]

we then isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( x \) from both sides:

\[
24 = 48x - 1176
\]

adding 1176 to both sides:

\[
1200 = 48x
\]

finally, dividing both sides by 48:

\[
x = \frac{1200}{48} = 25
\]

we verify that \( x = 25 \) satisfies the original equation:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{25 + 24}}{\sqrt{25 - 24}} = \frac{\sqrt{49}}{\sqrt{1}} = \frac{7}{1} = 7
\]

thus, the solution is valid, and the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]
