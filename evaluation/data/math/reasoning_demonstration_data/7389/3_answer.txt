Answer: Given the five statements involving real numbers \(a\) and \(b\):

1. \(\frac{1}{a} < \frac{1}{b}\)
2. \(a^2 > b^2\)
3. \(a < b\)
4. \(a < 0\)
5. \(b < 0\)

we need to determine the maximum number of these statements that can be true simultaneously.

### case analysis

**case 1: both \(a\) and \(b\) are negative**

- if \(a < b < 0\), then:
  - \(a^2 > b^2\) (true)
  - \(a < b\) (true)
  - \(a < 0\) (true)
  - \(b < 0\) (true)
  - \(\frac{1}{a} < \frac{1}{b}\) (false, since \(\frac{1}{a}\) is closer to zero than \(\frac{1}{b}\))

thus, statements 2, 3, 4, and 5 are true, but statement 1 is false.

**case 2: \(a\) is negative, \(b\) is positive**

- if \(a < 0\) and \(b > 0\), then:
  - \(\frac{1}{a} < \frac{1}{b}\) (true, since \(\frac{1}{a}\) is negative and \(\frac{1}{b}\) is positive)
  - \(a^2 > b^2\) (true if \(|a| > |b|\))
  - \(a < b\) (true)
  - \(a < 0\) (true)
  - \(b < 0\) (false)

thus, statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are true, but statement 5 is false.

**case 3: \(a\) is positive, \(b\) is negative**

- if \(a > 0\) and \(b < 0\), then:
  - \(\frac{1}{a} < \frac{1}{b}\) (false, since \(\frac{1}{a}\) is positive and \(\frac{1}{b}\) is negative)
  - \(a^2 > b^2\) (true if \(|a| > |b|\))
  - \(a < b\) (false)
  - \(a < 0\) (false)
  - \(b < 0\) (true)

thus, only statements 2 and 5 can be true.

**case 4: both \(a\) and \(b\) are positive**

- if \(a > 0\) and \(b > 0\), then:
  - \(\frac{1}{a} < \frac{1}{b}\) (true if \(a > b\))
  - \(a^2 > b^2\) (true if \(a > b\))
  - \(a < b\) (false if \(a > b\))
  - \(a < 0\) (false)
  - \(b < 0\) (false)

thus, at most statements 1 and 2 can be true.

### conclusion

the maximum number of statements that can be true simultaneously is four, which occurs in both case 1 and case 2.

\[
\boxed{4}
\]
