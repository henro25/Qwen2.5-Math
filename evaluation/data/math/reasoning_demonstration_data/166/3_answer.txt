Answer: To find the common rational root \( k \) of the equations

\[ 75x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + 12 = 0 \]
and
\[ 12x^5 + d x^4 + e x^3 + f x^2 + g x + 75 = 0, \]

we use the rational root theorem. for the first equation, the possible rational roots are of the form \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \( p \) divides 12 and \( q \) divides 75. for the second equation, the possible rational roots are of the form \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \( p \) divides 75 and \( q \) divides 12.

given that \( k \) is a negative rational number and not an integer, we list the possible negative rational roots for both equations and find their intersection.

for the first equation, the possible negative rational roots are:
\[ -\frac{1}{3}, -\frac{2}{3}, -\frac{4}{3}, -\frac{1}{5}, -\frac{2}{5}, -\frac{3}{5}, -\frac{4}{5}, -\frac{6}{5}, -\frac{12}{5}, -\frac{1}{15}, -\frac{2}{15}, -\frac{4}{15}, -\frac{1}{25}, -\frac{2}{25}, -\frac{3}{25}, -\frac{4}{25}, -\frac{6}{25}, -\frac{12}{25}, -\frac{1}{75}, -\frac{2}{75}, -\frac{4}{75}. \]

for the second equation, the possible negative rational roots are:
\[ -\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{3}{2}, -\frac{5}{2}, -\frac{15}{2}, -\frac{25}{2}, -\frac{75}{2}, -\frac{1}{3}, -\frac{5}{3}, -\frac{25}{3}, -\frac{1}{4}, -\frac{3}{4}, -\frac{5}{4}, -\frac{15}{4}, -\frac{25}{4}, -\frac{75}{4}, -\frac{1}{6}, -\frac{5}{6}, -\frac{25}{6}, -\frac{1}{12}, -\frac{5}{12}, -\frac{25}{12}. \]

the only common root in both lists is \( -\frac{1}{3} \).

therefore, the common rational root \( k \) is:
\[
\boxed{-\frac{1}{3}}
\]
