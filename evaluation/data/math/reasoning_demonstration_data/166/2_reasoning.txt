Reasoning: So i've got this problem here. there are two equations:

first, 
75
x
4
+
a
x
3
+
b
x
2
+
c
x
+
12
=
0
75x 
4
 +ax 
3
 +bx 
2
 +cx+12=0

and second, 
12
x
5
+
d
x
4
+
e
x
3
+
f
x
2
+
g
x
+
75
=
0
12x 
5
 +dx 
4
 +ex 
3
 +fx 
2
 +gx+75=0

they have a common rational root 
k
k that's not an integer and is negative. i need to find 
k
k.

hmm, since 
k
k is a common rational root of both equations, and it's not an integer and negative, i should probably start by recalling the rational root theorem.

the rational root theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as 
p
q
q
p
​
 , has 
p
p as a factor of the constant term and 
q
q as a factor of the leading coefficient.

so, for the first equation, 
75
x
4
+
a
x
3
+
b
x
2
+
c
x
+
12
=
0
75x 
4
 +ax 
3
 +bx 
2
 +cx+12=0, the constant term is 12 and the leading coefficient is 75.

therefore, possible values for 
p
p (the numerator) are the factors of 12: 
±
1
,
±
2
,
±
3
,
±
4
,
±
6
,
±
12
±1,±2,±3,±4,±6,±12

and possible values for 
q
q (the denominator) are the factors of 75: 
±
1
,
±
3
,
±
5
,
±
15
,
±
25
,
±
75
±1,±3,±5,±15,±25,±75

so, the possible rational roots for the first equation are all combinations of 
p
/
q
p/q where 
p
p divides 12 and 
q
q divides 75. but since 
k
k is not an integer, that means 
q
q can't be 1. also, 
k
k is negative, so we can focus on the negative fractions.

similarly, for the second equation, 
12
x
5
+
d
x
4
+
e
x
3
+
f
x
2
+
g
x
+
75
=
0
12x 
5
 +dx 
4
 +ex 
3
 +fx 
2
 +gx+75=0, the constant term is 75 and the leading coefficient is 12.

so, possible 
p
p values are factors of 75: 
±
1
,
±
3
,
±
5
,
±
15
,
±
25
,
±
75
±1,±3,±5,±15,±25,±75

and possible 
q
q values are factors of 12: 
±
1
,
±
2
,
±
3
,
±
4
,
±
6
,
±
12
±1,±2,±3,±4,±6,±12

again, 
k
k is not an integer, so 
q
q can't be 1, and it's negative.

now, since 
k
k is a common root of both equations, it must satisfy both sets of possible roots. so, i need to find a negative rational number that is in both lists of possible roots.

let me list out the possible negative rational roots for both equations.

for the first equation:

possible

so, after removing duplicates and integers, possible

now, to find a common

the only common fraction is

​
 .

wait, is that the only one?

looking again, 
−
1

− 
3

​
  appears in both lists.

are there any others?

looking back, 
−
1
3
− 
3
1
​
  is the only one that appears in both lists.

so, 
k
=
−
1
3
k=− 
3
1
​
 .

but i should verify if this is indeed a root of both equations.

given that the coefficients 
a
,
b
,
c
,
d
,
e
,
f
,
g
a,b,c,d,e,f,g are not specified, but the fact that 
k
k is a root of both equations regardless of these coefficients seems a bit tricky.

wait a minute, maybe there's another way to approach this without listing all possible roots.

since 
k
k is a root of both polynomials, then it must satisfy both equations simultaneously.

so, plugging 
k
k into both equations should give zero.

but without knowing 
a
,
b
,
c
,
d
,
e
,
f
,
g
a,b,c,d,e,f,g, it's hard to proceed directly.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the fact that 
k
k is a root of both, and set up a relationship between the two equations.

let me think differently.

suppose 
k
k is a root of the first equation:

75
k
4
+
a
k
3
+
b
k
2
+
c
k
+
12
=
0
75k 
4
 +ak 
3
 +bk 
2
 +ck+12=0

and of the second equation:

12
k
5
+
d
k
4
+
e
k
3
+
f
k
2
+
g
k
+
75
=
0
12k 
5
 +dk 
4
 +ek 
3
 +fk 
2
 +gk+75=0

since 
k
k is rational and not an integer, and negative, and common to both equations, perhaps i can express one equation in terms of the other.

alternatively, maybe i can use the fact that 
k
k is a root to relate the coefficients.

but this seems complicated.

going back to the rational root theorem seems more straightforward.

given that, and seeing that 
−
1
3
− 
3
1
​
  is the only common possible root in both lists, i'm inclined to think that's the answer.

but to be thorough, maybe i should check if 
−
1
3
− 
3
1
​
  satisfies both equations.

however, without knowing the coefficients 
a
,
b
,
c
,
d
,
e
,
f
,
g
a,b,c,d,e,f,g, i can't directly substitute and verify.

maybe there's another property i can use.

wait, perhaps i can consider that since 
k
k is a root of both polynomials, the polynomials share a common factor of 
(
x
−
k
)
(x−k).

but again, without knowing the coefficients, it's hard to proceed.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the reciprocal of 
k
k, given that the constant terms are 12 and 75, and the leading coefficients are 75 and 12, which are multiples of each other.

wait, 75 and 12 have a relationship: 75 is 12 multiplied by 6.25, but that's not an integer multiple.

wait, 75 divided by 12 is 6.25, which isn't helpful.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that 
k
k is a root of both, so the two polynomials are multiples of each other at 
x
=
k
x=k, but i'm not sure.

this seems too vague.

alternatively, maybe i can consider the degrees of the polynomials.

the first is degree 4, the second is degree 5.

if they share a common root, then perhaps their greatest common divisor (gcd) is at least degree 1.

but without knowing the coefficients, it's hard to find the gcd.

hmm.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider specific values.

wait, perhaps i can consider the product of the polynomials or something like that.

this seems too convoluted.

alternatively, perhaps i can think about the possible denominators and numerators.

given that 
k
=
−
1
3
k=− 
3
1
​
  is a candidate, and it's the only common possible root in both lists, i'm going to go with that.

therefore, the answer is 
−
1
3
− 
3
