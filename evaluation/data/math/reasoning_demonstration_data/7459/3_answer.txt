Answer: To solve for \( y \) in the equation \( 3y + 7y = 282 - 8(y - 3) \), follow these steps:

1. **Simplify both sides:**
   - Left side: \( 3y + 7y = 10y \)
   - Right side: Use the distributive property:
     \[
     282 - 8(y - 3) = 282 - 8y + 24 = 306 - 8y
     \]
   
2. **Set the simplified equation:**
   \[
   10y = 306 - 8y
   \]

3. **Add \( 8y \) to both sides:**
   \[
   10y + 8y = 306 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 18y = 306
   \]

4. **Solve for \( y \) by dividing both sides by 18:**
   \[
   y = \frac{306}{18} = 17
   \]

Thus, the solution is \( y = 17 \).
