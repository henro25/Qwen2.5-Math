Problem: A prism is constructed so that its vertical edges are parallel to the $z$-axis.  Its cross-section is a square of side length 10.

import three;

size(180);
currentprojection = perspective(6,3,2);

triple A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H;

A = (1,1,0);
B = (1,-1,0);
C = (-1,-1,0);
D = (-1,1,0);
E = A + (0,0,1);
F = B + (0,0,3);
G = C + (0,0,4);
H = D + (0,0,2);

draw(surface(E--F--G--H--cycle),gray(0.7),nolight);
draw(E--F--G--H--cycle);
draw(A--E);
draw(B--F);
draw(C--G,dashed);
draw(D--H);
draw(B--A--D);
draw(B--C--D,dashed);

The prism is then cut by the plane $4x - 7y + 4z = 25.$  Find the maximal area of the cross-section.
