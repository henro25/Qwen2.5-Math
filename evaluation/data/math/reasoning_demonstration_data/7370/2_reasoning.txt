Reasoning: Okay, so I've got this problem here: y equals 1 over (3x plus 1), and I need to find the value of x when y is 1. Alright, let's see. So, y is given as 1 divided by (3x + 1). And I need to find x when y is 1. So, I guess I should plug in y equals 1 into the equation and solve for x.

So, starting with y = 1/(3x + 1), and y is 1, so 1 = 1/(3x + 1). Hmm, that looks a bit tricky. So, I have 1 equals 1 over something, which means that something must be 1, right? Because 1 divided by 1 is 1. So, if 1 equals 1 over (3x + 1), then 3x + 1 must be 1. Wait, does that make sense?

Let me check. If I have 1 = 1/(3x + 1), then to get rid of the fraction, I can multiply both sides by (3x + 1). So, 1 times (3x + 1) equals 1. That simplifies to 3x + 1 = 1. Yeah, that seems right.

Now, I need to solve for x. So, I have 3x + 1 = 1. I can subtract 1 from both sides to get 3x = 0. Then, divide both sides by 3, and I get x = 0. So, is x equal to zero? That seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

If x is 0, then plugging back into the original equation: y = 1/(3*0 + 1) = 1/(0 + 1) = 1/1 = 1. Yeah, that works. So, x equals zero is the correct answer.

But wait, is there any other possible solution? Could there be another value of x that makes y equal to 1? Let's think about it. If I set y = 1, and solve for x, I only get x = 0. There's no other solution because it's a linear equation in x.

Just to make sure, maybe I can graph the function y = 1/(3x + 1) and see where it intersects y = 1. So, if I graph y = 1/(3x + 1), it's a hyperbola, and y = 1 is a horizontal line. They should intersect at x = 0, which matches what I found earlier.

Also, considering the domain of the function, 3x + 1 cannot be zero, because that would make the denominator zero, and the function undefined. So, 3x + 1 = 0 when x = -1/3. But in this case, x = 0 is fine because it doesn't make the denominator zero.

I think I've covered all the bases here. So, the value of x when y = 1 is zero.
