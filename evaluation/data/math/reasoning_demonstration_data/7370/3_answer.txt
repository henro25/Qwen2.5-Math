Answer: To find the value of \( x \) when \( y = 1 \) in the equation \( y = \frac{1}{3x + 1} \), follow these steps:

1. **Substitute \( y = 1 \) into the equation:**
   \[
   1 = \frac{1}{3x + 1}
   \]

2. **Multiply both sides by \( 3x + 1 \) to eliminate the denominator:**
   \[
   1 \cdot (3x + 1) = 1
   \]
   \[
   3x + 1 = 1
   \]

3. **Subtract 1 from both sides:**
   \[
   3x = 0
   \]

4. **Divide both sides by 3:**
   \[
   x = 0
   \]

Thus, the value of \( x \) when \( y = 1 \) is **0**.
