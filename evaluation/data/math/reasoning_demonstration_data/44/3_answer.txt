Answer: Given the equation \( ab^2 = \log_{10} b \) where \( a \) is a nonzero integer and \( b \) is a positive number, we need to find the median of the set \(\{0, 1, a, b, \frac{1}{b}\}\).

first, we explored different values for \( a \) and \( b \) to satisfy the equation. we found that for \( a = -100 \) and \( b = 0.1 \), the equation holds true:
\[
ab^2 = (-100)(0.1)^2 = -1 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_{10} b = \log_{10} 0.1 = -1
\]
similarly, for \( a = -20000 \) and \( b = 0.01 \), the equation also holds:
\[
ab^2 = (-20000)(0.01)^2 = -2 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_{10} b = \log_{10} 0.01 = -2
\]

we observed that for \( b = 10^{-k} \) where \( k \) is a positive integer, \( a = -k \cdot 10^{2k} \). the set \(\{0, 1, a, b, \frac{1}{b}\}\) becomes:
\[
\{0, 1, -k \cdot 10^{2k}, 10^{-k}, 10^k\}
\]
arranging this set in order:
\[
-k \cdot 10^{2k}, 0, 10^{-k}, 1, 10^k
\]
the median is \( 10^{-k} \), which is \( b \).

thus, the median of the set \(\{0, 1, a, b, \frac{1}{b}\}\) is always \( b \).

\[
\boxed{b}
\]
