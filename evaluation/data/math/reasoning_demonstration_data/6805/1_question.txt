Problem: To transmit a positive integer less than 1000, the Networked Number Node offers two options.

Option 1. Pay $\$$d to send each digit d. Therefore, 987 would cost $\$$9 + $\$$8 + $\$$7 = $\$$24 to transmit.

Option 2. Encode integer into binary (base 2) first, and then pay $\$$d to send each digit d. Therefore, 987 becomes 1111011011 and would cost $\$$1 + $\$$1 + $\$$1 + $\$$1 + $\$$0 + $\$$1 + $\$$1 + $\$$0 + $\$$1 + $\$$1 = $\$$8.

What is the largest integer less than 1000 that costs the same whether using Option 1 or Option 2?
