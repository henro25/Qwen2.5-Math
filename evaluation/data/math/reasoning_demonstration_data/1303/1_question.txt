Problem: Let $\mathbf{m},$ $\mathbf{n},$ and $\mathbf{p}$ be unit vectors such that the angle between $\mathbf{m}$ and $\mathbf{n}$ is $\alpha,$ and the angle between $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{m} \times \mathbf{n}$ is also $\alpha.$  If $\mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{m}) = \frac{1}{4},$ find the smallest possible value of $\alpha,$ in degrees.
