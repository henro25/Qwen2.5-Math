Answer: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that all four math majors sit in consecutive seats around a round table with nine people.

### Step 1: Total Number of Arrangements
Since it's a circular table, the total number of distinct seating arrangements for nine people is \((9-1)! = 8! = 40320\).

### Step 2: Favorable Arrangements (Math Majors Together)
We treat the four math majors as a single "block." This reduces the problem to arranging six entities (the math block and the other five individuals) around the table, which can be done in \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\) ways. Within the block, the four math majors can be arranged in \(4! = 24\) ways.

Thus, the total number of favorable arrangements is:
\[
5! \times 4! = 120 \times 24 = 2880
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Probability
The probability is the ratio of favorable arrangements to total arrangements:
\[
\frac{2880}{40320} = \frac{1}{14}
\]

### Conclusion
The probability that all four math majors sit in consecutive seats is \(\frac{1}{14}\).
