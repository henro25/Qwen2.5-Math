Answer: To find the area of the circular base of the fountain, we start by noting that the repair crew places a 16-foot plank from \( a \) to \( b \) and a 10-foot plank from \( d \) to \( c \), where \( d \) is the midpoint of \( \overline{ab} \). this forms a right-angled triangle \( \triangle cda \) with \( cd = 10 \) feet, \( ad = 8 \) feet, and \( ca = r \) (the radius of the circle).

using the pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle cda \):

\[
r^2 = cd^2 + ad^2
\]

substituting the given values:

\[
r^2 = 10^2 + 8^2 = 100 + 64 = 164
\]

thus, the area of the circular base is:

\[
\pi r^2 = \pi \times 164 = 164\pi
\]

therefore, the area of the circular base of the fountain is:

\[
\boxed{164\pi}
\]
