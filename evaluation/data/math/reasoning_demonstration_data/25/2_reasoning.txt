Reasoning: Let's dive into this problem. so, we have a circular fountain, and the repair crew wants to walk to the center c of this fountain. they've placed a 16-foot plank from point a to point b, and then a 10-foot plank from point d to c, where d is the midpoint of the segment ab. we need to find the area of the circular base of the fountain in terms of π.

first, i need to visualize this setup. there's a circle, and points a and b are on the circumference connected by a 16-foot plank, which i assume is a straight line. d is the midpoint of ab, so ad equals db, each being 8 feet. then, from d, there's a 10-foot plank going to the center c of the circle.

so, in the top view, we have a circle with center c. points a and b are on the circumference, and ab is a chord of the circle with length 16 feet. d is the midpoint of ab, so ad = db = 8 feet. then, dc is a line from d to c, which is 10 feet long.

i need to find the area of the circle, which is πr², where r is the radius of the circle.

to find r, i need to relate it to the given lengths: ab = 16 feet, dc = 10 feet.

let me try to find some relationships here. since d is the midpoint of ab, and c is the center, dc might be related to the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord ab.

wait, in circle geometry, the perpendicular distance from the center to a chord can be found using the formula:

d = √(r² - (c/2)²)

where d is the distance from the center to the chord, c is the length of the chord.

in this case, ab is the chord, so c = 16 feet, and the distance from c to ab would be d.

but in our problem, dc is not necessarily perpendicular to ab. wait, but since d is the midpoint of ab, and c is the center, the line from c to d should be perpendicular to ab, because in a circle, the line from the center to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord.

yes, that makes sense. so, cd is perpendicular to ab, and cd is 10 feet.

therefore, using the formula:

d = √(r² - (c/2)²)

here, d is the distance from the center to the chord, which is cd = 10 feet.

c is the length of the chord ab = 16 feet.

so, plugging in the values:

10 = √(r² - (16/2)²)

10 = √(r² - 8²)

10 = √(r² - 64)

now, let's square both sides to eliminate the square root:

10² = r² - 64

100 = r² - 64

now, solve for r²:

r² = 100 + 64

r² = 164

therefore, the area of the circle is πr² = π * 164 = 164π.

wait, but let me double-check that. is cd really equal to d in the formula?

let me recall the formula for the distance from the center to a chord:

d = √(r² - (c/2)²)

here, d is the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord, and c is the length of the chord.

in this problem, cd is given as 10 feet, and it should be the perpendicular distance from c to ab, since d is the midpoint.

yes, that seems correct.

alternatively, i can think of triangle cda.

let me consider triangle cda.

point a is on the circumference, so ca is the radius, which is r.

ad is half of ab, which is 8 feet.

cd is 10 feet.

so, in triangle cda, we have sides of lengths:

ca = r

ad = 8 feet

cd = 10 feet

and angle at d is a right angle, because cd is perpendicular to ab.

therefore, triangle cda is a right-angled triangle with legs cd = 10 and ad = 8, and hypotenuse ca = r.

so, by pythagoras' theorem:

ca² = cd² + ad²

r² = 10² + 8²

r² = 100 + 64

r² = 164

so, area is πr² = 164π.

wait, but i need to make sure that angle at d is indeed 90 degrees.

in a circle, the line from the center perpendicular to a chord bisects the chord, and conversely, the line from the center to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord.

since d is the midpoint of ab, and c is the center, then cd is perpendicular to ab.

therefore, triangle cda is right-angled at d.

yes, that confirms the earlier calculation.

alternatively, i could use the intersecting chords theorem or other circle properties, but in this case, the right-angled triangle approach seems straightforward and gives a clear path to the solution.

so, the area of the circular base is 164π square feet.
