Answer: We start with an equilateral triangle with sides of length 2 units. each subsequent triangle has sides that are 150% of the previous one. we need to find the percent increase in the perimeter from the first to the fourth triangle.

first, we calculate the side lengths of the triangles:
- first triangle: side length = 2 units
- second triangle: side length = \(1.5 \times 2 = 3\) units
- third triangle: side length = \(1.5 \times 3 = 4.5\) units
- fourth triangle: side length = \(1.5 \times 4.5 = 6.75\) units

next, we calculate the perimeters of the triangles:
- first triangle: perimeter = \(3 \times 2 = 6\) units
- second triangle: perimeter = \(3 \times 3 = 9\) units
- third triangle: perimeter = \(3 \times 4.5 = 13.5\) units
- fourth triangle: perimeter = \(3 \times 6.75 = 20.25\) units

the percent increase in the perimeter from the first to the fourth triangle is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{percent increase} = \left( \frac{20.25 - 6}{6} \right) \times 100\%
\]
\[
\text{percent increase} = \left( \frac{14.25}{6} \right) \times 100\% = 2.375 \times 100\% = 237.5\%
\]

thus, the percent increase in the perimeter from the first to the fourth triangle is \(\boxed{237.5\%}\).
