Answer: To solve the problem, we need to ensure that no triangle with positive area can be formed with side lengths \(1, a, b\) or \(\frac{1}{b}, \frac{1}{a}, 1\) for \(1 < a < b\). we use the triangle inequality conditions for both sets of side lengths.

for the sides \(1, a, b\):
1. \(1 + a \leq b\)

for the sides \(\frac{1}{b}, \frac{1}{a}, 1\):
1. \(\frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{a} \leq 1\)

we need to find the smallest possible value of \(b\) given these conditions.

first, we solve the inequality \(\frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{a} \leq 1\) by expressing \(b\) in terms of \(a\):
\[ b \geq 1 + a \]

substituting \(b = 1 + a\) into the inequality:
\[ \frac{1}{1+a} + \frac{1}{a} \leq 1 \]

combining the fractions:
\[ \frac{a + (1 + a)}{a(1 + a)} \leq 1 \]
\[ \frac{2a + 1}{a(a + 1)} \leq 1 \]

subtracting 1 from both sides:
\[ \frac{2a + 1 - a(a + 1)}{a(a + 1)} \leq 0 \]
\[ \frac{2a + 1 - a^2 - a}{a(a + 1)} \leq 0 \]
\[ \frac{-a^2 + a + 1}{a(a + 1)} \leq 0 \]

rewriting:
\[ \frac{a^2 - a - 1}{a(a + 1)} \geq 0 \]

solving \(a^2 - a - 1 = 0\) using the quadratic formula:
\[ a = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \]

since \(a > 1\), we take:
\[ a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \]

then:
\[ b = 1 + a = 1 + \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \]

thus, the smallest possible value of \(b\) is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}
\]
