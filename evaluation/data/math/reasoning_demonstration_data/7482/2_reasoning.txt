Reasoning: So i need to simplify the complex fraction 
3
+
4
i
1
+
2
i
1+2i
3+4i
​	
  and express it in the form 
a
+
b
i
a+bi, where 
a
a and 
b
b are real numbers, possibly as improper fractions. hmm, i remember that to simplify a fraction with complex numbers, i should multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. the conjugate of a complex number 
a
+
b
i
a+bi is 
a
−
b
i
a−bi. so, for the denominator 
1
+
2
i
1+2i, the conjugate would be 
1
−
2
i
1−2i.

let me write that down:

3
+
4
i
1
+
2
i
×
1
−
2
i
1
−
2
i
1+2i
3+4i
​	
 × 
1−2i
1−2i
​	
 
this should eliminate the imaginary part in the denominator because 
(
1
+
2
i
)
(
1
−
2
i
)
(1+2i)(1−2i) is a difference of squares:

(
1
)
2
−
(
2
i
)
2
=
1
−
4
i
2
(1) 
2
 −(2i) 
2
 =1−4i 
2
 
and since 
i
2
=
−
1
i 
2
 =−1, this becomes:

1
−
4
(
−
1
)
=
1
+
4
=
5
1−4(−1)=1+4=5
okay, so the denominator simplifies to 5. now, let's work on the numerator:

(
3
+
4
i
)
(
1
−
2
i
)
(3+4i)(1−2i)
i need to multiply these two complex numbers. i'll use the distributive property (foil):

3
×
1
=
3
3×1=3
3
×
(
−
2
i
)
=
−
6
i
3×(−2i)=−6i
4
i
×
1
=
4
i
4i×1=4i
4
i
×
(
−
2
i
)
=
−
8
i
2
4i×(−2i)=−8i 
2
 
now, combine these terms:

3
−
6
i
+
4
i
−
8
i
2
3−6i+4i−8i 
2
 
combine like terms:

3
+
(
−
6
i
+
4
i
)
−
8
i
2
=
3
−
2
i
−
8
i
2
3+(−6i+4i)−8i 
2
 =3−2i−8i 
2
 
again, since 
i
2
=
−
1
i 
2
 =−1, this becomes:

3
−
2
i
−
8
(
−
1
)
=
3
−
2
i
+
8
=
11
−
2
i
3−2i−8(−1)=3−2i+8=11−2i
so, the numerator simplifies to 
11
−
2
i
11−2i, and the denominator is 5. therefore, the fraction simplifies to:

11
−
2
i
5
=
11
5
−
2
i
5
5
11−2i
​	
 = 
5
11
​	
 − 
5
2i
​	
 
so, in the form 
a
+
b
i
a+bi, 
a
=
11
5
a= 
5
11
​	
  and 
b
=
−
2
5
b=− 
5
2
​	
 .

wait, but the problem says to write 
a
a and 
b
b as improper fractions if necessary. in this case, 
11
5
5
11
​	
  is already an improper fraction, and 
−
2
5
− 
5
2
​	
  is fine as is.

just to double-check, i'll verify my steps.

first, i multiplied numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is correct. then, i expanded the numerator correctly using foil. combined like terms and substituted 
i
2
=
−
1
i 
2
 =−1, which seems right.

the denominator simplifies to 5, and the numerator to 
11
−
2
i
11−2i, so dividing both parts by 5 gives 
11
5
−
2
5
i
5
11
​	
 − 
5
2
​	
 i, which matches what i have.

i think that's it. i don't see any mistakes in my calculations.

**final answer**
