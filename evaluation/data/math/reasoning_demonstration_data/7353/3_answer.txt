Answer: To find the ratio of the side length of an equilateral triangle to the side length of a square, given that both have perimeters of 48 inches, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the side length of the triangle:**
   - An equilateral triangle has 3 equal sides.
   - Let the side length be \( t \).
   - The perimeter is \( 3t = 48 \).
   - Solving for \( t \): 
     \[
     t = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \text{ inches}.
     \]

2. **Determine the side length of the square:**
   - A square has 4 equal sides.
   - Let the side length be \( s \).
   - The perimeter is \( 4s = 48 \).
   - Solving for \( s \):
     \[
     s = \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ inches}.
     \]

3. **Find the ratio of the side of the triangle to the side of the square:**
   - The ratio is \( \frac{t}{s} = \frac{16}{12} \).
   - Simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:
     \[
     \frac{16 \div 4}{12 \div 4} = \frac{4}{3}.
     \]

**Answer:** The ratio of the side length of the triangle to the side length of the square is \(\boxed{\dfrac{4}{3}}\).
