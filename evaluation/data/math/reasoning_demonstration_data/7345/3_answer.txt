Answer: To find the area of the region enclosed by the graph of the equation \( x^2 - 14x + 3y + 70 = 21 + 11y - y^2 \) that lies below the line \( y = x - 3 \), we start by simplifying the given equation:

\[
x^2 - 14x + 3y + 70 = 21 + 11y - y^2
\]

rearranging terms:

\[
x^2 - 14x + y^2 - 8y + 49 = 0
\]

completing the square for both \( x \) and \( y \):

\[
(x - 7)^2 - 49 + (y - 4)^2 - 16 + 49 = 0
\]

simplifying:

\[
(x - 7)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 16
\]

this represents a circle with center \((7, 4)\) and radius 4.

next, we find the intersection points of the line \( y = x - 3 \) with the circle:

\[
(x - 7)^2 + ((x - 3) - 4)^2 = 16
\]

simplifying:

\[
(x - 7)^2 + (x - 7)^2 = 16
\]

\[
2(x - 7)^2 = 16
\]

\[
(x - 7)^2 = 8
\]

\[
x = 7 \pm 2\sqrt{2}
\]

corresponding \( y \) values:

\[
y = (7 + 2\sqrt{2}) - 3 = 4 + 2\sqrt{2}
\]
\[
y = (7 - 2\sqrt{2}) - 3 = 4 - 2\sqrt{2}
\]

the points of intersection are \((7 + 2\sqrt{2}, 4 + 2\sqrt{2})\) and \((7 - 2\sqrt{2}, 4 - 2\sqrt{2})\).

since the line \( y = x - 3 \) passes through the center of the circle, it divides the circle into two equal halves. therefore, the area below the line is half the area of the circle.

the area of the circle is:

\[
\pi r^2 = \pi \times 4^2 = 16\pi
\]

thus, the area below the line is:

\[
\frac{16\pi}{2} = 8\pi
\]

the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{8\pi}
\]
