Reasoning: So i need to find the area of the region enclosed by the graph of the equation 
x
2
−
14
x
+
3
y
+
70
=
21
+
11
y
−
y
2
x 
2
 −14x+3y+70=21+11y−y 
2
  that lies below the line 
y
=
x
−
3
y=x−3. hmm, that looks a bit complicated at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.

first, i think i should simplify the given equation to understand what kind of graph it represents. so, starting with:

x
2
−
14
x
+
3
y
+
70
=
21
+
11
y
−
y
2
x 
2
 −14x+3y+70=21+11y−y 
2
 
i can move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:

x
2
−
14
x
+
3
y
+
70
−
21
−
11
y
+
y
2
=
0
x 
2
 −14x+3y+70−21−11y+y 
2
 =0
simplifying the constants and like terms:

x
2
−
14
x
+
y
2
−
8
y
+
49
=
0
x 
2
 −14x+y 
2
 −8y+49=0
hmm, this looks like a quadratic in both 
x
x and 
y
y, which suggests it might be a circle or some conic section. to confirm, i should try to complete the squares for both 
x
x and 
y
y.

starting with the 
x
x-terms:

x
2
−
14
x
x 
2
 −14x
to complete the square, take half of -14, which is -7, and square it to get 49. so:

x
2
−
14
x
+
49
=
(
x
−
7
)
2
x 
2
 −14x+49=(x−7) 
2
 
now for the 
y
y-terms:

y
2
−
8
y
y 
2
 −8y
half of -8 is -4, and squaring it gives 16. so:

y
2
−
8
y
+
16
=
(
y
−
4
)
2
y 
2
 −8y+16=(y−4) 
2
 
now, i need to adjust the equation to account for the added constants:

(
x
−
7
)
2
−
49
+
(
y
−
4
)
2
−
16
+
49
=
0
(x−7) 
2
 −49+(y−4) 
2
 −16+49=0
wait, i added 49 and 16 from the squares, so i need to subtract them to keep the equation balanced. but i already have +49 in the original equation, so let's see:

original simplified equation:

x
2
−
14
x
+
y
2
−
8
y
+
49
=
0
x 
2
 −14x+y 
2
 −8y+49=0
after completing the squares:

(
x
−
7
)
2
−
49
+
(
y
−
4
)
2
−
16
+
49
=
0
(x−7) 
2
 −49+(y−4) 
2
 −16+49=0
the -49 and +49 cancel out, leaving:

(
x
−
7
)
2
+
(
y
−
4
)
2
−
16
=
0
(x−7) 
2
 +(y−4) 
2
 −16=0
so:

(
x
−
7
)
2
+
(
y
−
4
)
2
=
16
(x−7) 
2
 +(y−4) 
2
 =16
okay, this is the equation of a circle with center at (7, 4) and radius 4, since 
16
=
4
2
16=4 
2
 .

now, i need to find the area of the region enclosed by this circle that lies below the line 
y
=
x
−
3
y=x−3.

first, i should find where the line intersects the circle because that will define the boundaries of the region we're interested in.

so, let's solve the system:

1. 
(
x
−
7
)
2
+
(
y
−
4
)
2
=
16
(x−7) 
2
 +(y−4) 
2
 =16

2. 
y
=
x
−
3
y=x−3

substitute 
y
y from the second equation into the first:

(
x
−
7
)
2
+
(
(
x
−
3
)
−
4
)
2
=
16
(x−7) 
2
 +((x−3)−4) 
2
 =16
simplify inside the second square:

(
x
−
7
)
2
+
(
x
−
7
)
2
=
16
(x−7) 
2
 +(x−7) 
2
 =16
so:

2
(
x
−
7
)
2
=
16
2(x−7) 
2
 =16
divide both sides by 2:

(
x
−
7
)
2
=
8
(x−7) 
2
 =8
take square roots:

x
−
7
=
±
8
x−7=± 
8
​	
 
so:

x
=
7
±
2
2
x=7±2 
2
​	
 
now, find the corresponding 
y
y values using 
y
=
x
−
3
y=x−3:

for 
x
=
7
+
2
2
x=7+2 
2
​	
 :

y
=
(
7
+
2
2
)
−
3
=
4
+
2
2
y=(7+2 
2
​	
 )−3=4+2 
2
​	
 
for 
x
=
7
−
2
2
x=7−2 
2
​	
 :

y
=
(
7
−
2
2
)
−
3
=
4
−
2
2
y=(7−2 
2
​	
 )−3=4−2 
2
​	
 
so, the points of intersection are:

(
7
+
2
2
,
4
+
2
2
)
(7+2 
2
​	
 ,4+2 
2
​	
 )
(
7
−
2
2
,
4
−
2
2
)
(7−2 
2
​	
 ,4−2 
2
​	
 )
next, i need to find the area of the circle that lies below the line 
y
=
x
−
3
y=x−3. to do this, i can find the area of the circle segment that is below the line.

first, i need to find the distance from the center of the circle to the line 
y
=
x
−
3
y=x−3, because that will help me determine the angle of the segment.

the formula for the distance 
d
d from a point 
(
x
0
,
y
0
)
(x 
0
​	
 ,y 
0
​	
 ) to the line 
a
x
+
b
y
+
c
=
0
ax+by+c=0 is:

d
=
∣
a
x
0
+
b
y
0
+
c
∣
a
2
+
b
2
d= 
a 
2
 +b 
2
 
​	
 
∣ax 
0
​	
 +by 
0
​	
 +c∣
​	
 
first, write the line equation in standard form:

y
=
x
−
3
y=x−3
−
x
+
y
+
3
=
0
−x+y+3=0
so, 
a
=
−
1
a=−1, 
b
=
1
b=1, 
c
=
3
c=3, and the center of the circle is 
(
7
,
4
)
(7,4).

plugging in:

d
=
∣
−
1
⋅
7
+
1
⋅
4
+
3
∣
(
−
1
)
2
+
1
2
=
∣
−
7
+
4
+
3
∣
1
+
1
=
∣
0
∣
2
=
0
d= 
(−1) 
2
 +1 
2
 
​	
 
∣−1⋅7+1⋅4+3∣
​	
 = 
1+1
​	
 
∣−7+4+3∣
​	
 = 
2
​	
 
∣0∣
​	
 =0
wait, the distance is zero? that means the line passes through the center of the circle.

that's interesting. so, the line 
y
=
x
−
3
y=x−3 passes through the center of the circle at (7,4).

but i need to confirm that. let's plug in (7,4) into the line equation:

y
=
x
−
3
y=x−3
4
=
7
−
3
4=7−3
4
=
4
4=4
yes, it does pass through the center.

so, since the line passes through the center of the circle, it should divide the circle into two equal halves.

therefore, the area below the line should be exactly half the area of the circle.

the area of the circle is 
π
r
2
=
π
×
4
2
=
16
π
πr 
2
 =π×4 
2
 =16π.

so, half of that would be 
8
π
8π.

but wait, let me make sure that the line actually divides the circle into two equal areas.

since the line passes through the center, it should be a diameter of the circle, and thus, it divides the circle into two equal halves.

therefore, the area below the line should indeed be 
8
π
8π.

but to be thorough, let's consider the points of intersection.

we have the circle:

(
x
−
7
)
2
+
(
y
−
4
)
2
=
16
(x−7) 
2
 +(y−4) 
2
 =16
and the line passes through the center, so it should split the circle into two equal areas.

alternatively, i could set up an integral to find the area below the line, but since the line passes through the center, it should be symmetric.

therefore, the area below the line is half the area of the circle.

so, the area is 
8
π
8π.

but just to double-check, perhaps i should sketch the graph.

imagine a circle centered at (7,4) with radius 4. the line 
y
=
x
−
3
y=x−3 passes through the center, so it's a diameter of the circle.

therefore, the area below the line is indeed half the circle's area.

so, the final answer should be 
8
π
8π.

but the problem asks for the area enclosed by the graph of the equation that lies below the line 
y
=
x
−
3
y=x−3.

given that the graph is a circle and the line passes through its center, dividing it into two equal halves, the area below the line is 
8
π
8π.

therefore, the answer is 
8
π
8π.

**final answer**

8π
