Reasoning: So i have this expression to simplify: 
cos
⁡
x
1
+
sin
⁡
x
+
1
+
sin
⁡
x
cos
⁡
x
1+sinx
cosx
​	
 + 
cosx
1+sinx
​	
 . i'm a bit rusty on trigonometric identities, but i'll try to work through this step by step.

first, i notice that there are two fractions being added together, and they have denominators 
1
+
sin
⁡
x
1+sinx and 
cos
⁡
x
cosx. maybe i can find a common denominator to combine them. the common denominator would be 
(
1
+
sin
⁡
x
)
(
cos
⁡
x
)
(1+sinx)(cosx).

so, rewriting both fractions with the common denominator:

cos
⁡
x
⋅
cos
⁡
x
(
1
+
sin
⁡
x
)
(
cos
⁡
x
)
+
(
1
+
sin
⁡
x
)
(
1
+
sin
⁡
x
)
(
1
+
sin
⁡
x
)
(
cos
⁡
x
)
(1+sinx)(cosx)
cosx⋅cosx
​	
 + 
(1+sinx)(cosx)
(1+sinx)(1+sinx)
​	
 
simplifying the numerators:

cos
⁡
2
x
+
(
1
+
sin
⁡
x
)
2
(
1
+
sin
⁡
x
)
(
cos
⁡
x
)
(1+sinx)(cosx)
cos 
2
 x+(1+sinx) 
2
 
​	
 
now, expand 
(
1
+
sin
⁡
x
)
2
(1+sinx) 
2
 :

1
+
2
sin
⁡
x
+
sin
⁡
2
x
1+2sinx+sin 
2
 x
so the numerator becomes:

cos
⁡
2
x
+
1
+
2
sin
⁡
x
+
sin
⁡
2
x
cos 
2
 x+1+2sinx+sin 
2
 x
i know that 
cos
⁡
2
x
+
sin
⁡
2
x
=
1
cos 
2
 x+sin 
2
 x=1, so substituting that in:

1
+
1
+
2
sin
⁡
x
=
2
+
2
sin
⁡
x
1+1+2sinx=2+2sinx
so now the expression is:

2
+
2
sin
⁡
x
(
1
+
sin
⁡
x
)
(
cos
⁡
x
)
(1+sinx)(cosx)
2+2sinx
​	
 
i can factor out a 2 in the numerator:

2
(
1
+
sin
⁡
x
)
(
1
+
sin
⁡
x
)
(
cos
⁡
x
)
(1+sinx)(cosx)
2(1+sinx)
​	
 
now, i can cancel out the 
(
1
+
sin
⁡
x
)
(1+sinx) terms:

2
cos
⁡
x
cosx
2
​	
 
and 
1
cos
⁡
x
cosx
1
​	
  is 
sec
⁡
x
secx, so this simplifies to:

2
sec
⁡
x
2secx
wait, but i feel like there might be another way to approach this. maybe using some trigonometric identities differently. let me try another method.

i recall that 
cos
⁡
x
1
+
sin
⁡
x
1+sinx
cosx
​	
  can be multiplied by 
1
−
sin
⁡
x
1
−
sin
⁡
x
1−sinx
1−sinx
​	
  to rationalize the denominator:

cos
⁡
x
(
1
−
sin
⁡
x
)
(
1
+
sin
⁡
x
)
(
1
−
sin
⁡
x
)
=
cos
⁡
x
(
1
−
sin
⁡
x
)
1
−
sin
⁡
2
x
=
cos
⁡
x
(
1
−
sin
⁡
x
)
cos
⁡
2
x
=
1
−
sin
⁡
x
cos
⁡
x
(1+sinx)(1−sinx)
cosx(1−sinx)
​	
 = 
1−sin 
2
 x
cosx(1−sinx)
​	
 = 
cos 
2
 x
cosx(1−sinx)
​	
 = 
cosx
1−sinx
​	
 
so, the first term simplifies to 
1
−
sin
⁡
x
cos
⁡
x
cosx
1−sinx
​	
 , and the second term is 
1
+
sin
⁡
x
cos
⁡
x
cosx
1+sinx
​	
 . now, adding them together:

1
−
sin
⁡
x
cos
⁡
x
+
1
+
sin
⁡
x
cos
⁡
x
=
(
1
−
sin
⁡
x
)
+
(
1
+
sin
⁡
x
)
cos
⁡
x
=
2
cos
⁡
x
=
2
sec
⁡
x
cosx
1−sinx
​	
 + 
cosx
1+sinx
​	
 = 
cosx
(1−sinx)+(1+sinx)
​	
 = 
cosx
2
​	
 =2secx
okay, so both methods lead me to the same answer: 
2
sec
⁡
x
2secx. i think that's the simplest form.

alternatively, i could check if there's a way to express this in terms of other trigonometric functions, but i don't see an immediate benefit to doing so. 
2
sec
⁡
x
2secx seems straightforward and is likely the expected simplified form.

let me verify this by plugging in a specific value for 
x
x. suppose 
x
=
0
x=0:

they match. let's try another value, say 
x

x=

 :

​

hmm, this is undefined because of division by zero in the second term, which makes sense since 
cos

π
2
=
0
cos 
2
π
​	
 =0. the simplified expression:

2

also undefined, which matches.

they match again. it seems like 
2
sec
⁡
x
2secx is indeed the correct and simplified form of the original expression.

i could also consider if there's a way to express this without the secant function, but since secant is the reciprocal of cosine, and the expression is already in terms of a single trigonometric function, i think this is as simplified as it gets.

another thought: perhaps using pythagorean identities or other reciprocal identities might offer a different perspective, but i don't see a more straightforward simplification than 
2
sec
⁡
x
2secx.

let me think about the structure of the original expression again. it has terms with 
1
+
sin
⁡
x
1+sinx and 
cos
⁡
x
cosx in both the numerator and denominator positions. by finding a common denominator and simplifying, i efficiently combined the two fractions into a single term.

alternatively, if i had tried to combine them differently, say by expressing everything in terms of sine and cosine, i might not have arrived as quickly at the simplified form. the method i used seems efficient.

in summary, after simplifying the expression step by step and verifying with specific values, i'm confident that the simplified form of the given expression is 
2
sec
⁡
x
2secx.

**final answer**

x
2secx
