Problem: A pirate is searching for buried treasure on 6 islands. On each island, there is a $\frac{1}{4}$ chance that the island has buried treasure and no traps, a $\frac{1}{12}$ chance that the island has traps but no treasure, and a $\frac{2}{3}$ chance that the island has neither traps nor treasure. What is the probability that while searching all 6 islands, the pirate will encounter exactly 3 islands with treasure, and none with traps?
