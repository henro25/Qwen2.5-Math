Problem: Milton spilled some ink on his homework paper. He can't read the coefficient of $x$, but he knows that the equation has two distinct negative, integer solutions. What is the sum of all of the distinct possible integers that could be under the ink stain?

draw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3)--cycle);
fill((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3)--cycle,black);
label("$x+36=0$",(3,1.5),E);
label("$x^{2}+$",(0,1.5),W);
