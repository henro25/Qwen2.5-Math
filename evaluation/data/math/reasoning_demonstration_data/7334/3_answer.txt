Answer: To find the length of the base of an isosceles triangle with congruent sides of 5 cm each and a perimeter of 17 cm, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - The triangle is isosceles, meaning it has two equal sides.
   - The lengths of the two congruent sides are 5 cm each.
   - The perimeter of the triangle is 17 cm.

2. **Set up the equation for the perimeter:**
   - Let the base be denoted by \( b \).
   - The perimeter is the sum of all sides: \( 5 + 5 + b = 17 \).

3. **Solve for the base \( b \):**
   \[
   10 + b = 17 \\
   b = 17 - 10 \\
   b = 7 \text{ cm}
   \]

4. **Verify the triangle inequality:**
   - Check that the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side:
     - \( 5 + 5 > 7 \) (10 > 7, true)
     - \( 5 + 7 > 5 \) (12 > 5, true)
     - \( 5 + 7 > 5 \) (12 > 5, true)

Since all conditions are satisfied, the length of the base is **7 cm**.
