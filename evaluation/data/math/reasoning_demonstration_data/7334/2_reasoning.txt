Reasoning: Alright, so I've got this problem here about an isosceles triangle. I know that in an isosceles triangle, two sides are equal in length. The problem says that the congruent sides are each 5 cm long, and the perimeter is 17 cm. I need to find the length of the base.

First, I should probably recall what the perimeter of a triangle is. The perimeter is just the sum of all its sides. So, for a triangle with sides a, b, and c, the perimeter P is P = a + b + c.

In this case, since it's an isosceles triangle, two sides are equal. Let's call those two equal sides the legs, and the third side the base. So, the legs are each 5 cm, and the base is what I'm trying to find.

Let me denote the base as b. So, the perimeter is the sum of the two legs and the base: P = 5 cm + 5 cm + b.

The perimeter is given as 17 cm, so I can set up the equation: 5 + 5 + b = 17.

Simplifying that, 10 + b = 17.

To solve for b, I subtract 10 from both sides: b = 17 - 10, which means b = 7 cm.

Wait a minute, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Is there anything else I need to consider about isosceles triangles? Well, I know that in an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal. But I don't think that's relevant here since the problem is only asking for the length of the base, not the angles.

Also, I should ensure that the triangle inequality holds true. The triangle inequality states that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

So, let's check:

- 5 cm + 5 cm > 7 cm → 10 cm > 7 cm, which is true.

- 5 cm + 7 cm > 5 cm → 12 cm > 5 cm, which is true.

- 5 cm + 7 cm > 5 cm → 12 cm > 5 cm, which is also true.

All the triangle inequalities are satisfied, so a triangle with sides 5 cm, 5 cm, and 7 cm is possible.

I think that's it. The base should be 7 cm.
