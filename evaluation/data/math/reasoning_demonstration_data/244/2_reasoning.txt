Reasoning: Let's see. i have this problem: given that the point (4,7) is on the graph of y = f(x), and i need to find a point that must be on the graph of 2y = 3f(4x) + 5. then, i have to find the sum of the coordinates of that point. hmm.

first, since (4,7) is on y = f(x), that means when x = 4, y = 7. so, f(4) = 7. got it.

now, i need to work with the equation 2y = 3f(4x) + 5. i need to find a point (a,b) such that when x = a and y = b, this equation holds true.

let me try to express y in terms of f(x). starting with 2y = 3f(4x) + 5, i can solve for y:

2y = 3f(4x) + 5

divide both sides by 2:

y = (3f(4x) + 5)/2

okay, so y is expressed in terms of f(4x). now, i need to find a value of x such that i can use the known value of f(4), which is 7.

wait a minute, in f(4x), the input to f is 4x. so, if i can make 4x equal to 4, then f(4x) would be f(4), which is 7. that seems promising.

so, set 4x = 4:

4x = 4

divide both sides by 4:

x = 1

alright, so when x = 1, f(4x) = f(4) = 7.

now, plug x = 1 back into the equation for y:

y = (3f(4x) + 5)/2

we know f(4x) = f(4) = 7, so:

y = (3*7 + 5)/2

calculate that:

3*7 = 21

21 + 5 = 26

26 / 2 = 13

so, y = 13.

therefore, the point (1,13) is on the graph of 2y = 3f(4x) + 5.

now, the problem asks for the sum of the coordinates of that point.

sum = 1 + 13 = 14.

wait, is there only one such point? let me check if there could be another point.

suppose there's another x where f(4x) is known, but i only know f(4) = 7. unless there are other points given for f(x), i can't determine other values of f(4x). so, it seems like (1,13) is the only point i can be certain about based on the given information.

therefore, the sum of the coordinates is 14.
