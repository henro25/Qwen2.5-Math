Problem: As shown in the figure below, a circular park consists of an outer-ring path for walkers (white) and a ring-shaped flower garden (gray) surrounding a central circular fountain (black). The walking path is six feet wide in all places, the garden ring is eight feet wide in all places, and the fountain has a diameter of 10 feet. What is the diameter, in feet, of the circle that is the outer boundary of the walking path?

filldraw(Circle((0,0),13),gray(.6),black);
fill(Circle((0,0),5),black);
draw("$8'$",(0,5)--(0,13));
draw("$6'$",(13,0)--(19,0));
