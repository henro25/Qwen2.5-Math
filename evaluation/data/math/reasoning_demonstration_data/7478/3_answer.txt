Answer: To find the value of \( f(5) \) for the function \( f(x) = \dfrac{x + 1}{3x - 4} \), we follow these steps:

1. substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
   \[
   f(5) = \dfrac{5 + 1}{3(5) - 4}
   \]

2. simplify the numerator:
   \[
   5 + 1 = 6
   \]

3. simplify the denominator:
   \[
   3(5) - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11
   \]

4. therefore, the value of \( f(5) \) is:
   \[
   f(5) = \dfrac{6}{11}
   \]

thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{6}{11}}
\]
