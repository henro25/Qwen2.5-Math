Reasoning: So i have this problem here: if 
f
(
x
)
=
x
+
1
3
x
−
4
f(x)= 
3x−4
x+1
​	
 , what is the value of 
f
(
5
)
f(5)? okay, i need to find 
f
(
5
)
f(5), which means i should plug in 5 for x in the function.

first, let me make sure i understand the function correctly. it's a rational function, meaning it's a ratio of two polynomials. the numerator is 
x
+
1
x+1 and the denominator is 
3
x
−
4
3x−4. so, to find 
f
(
5
)
f(5), i just substitute 5 into both the numerator and the denominator.

let me write that down:

f
(
5
)
=
5
+
1
3
(
5
)
−
4
f(5)= 
3(5)−4
5+1
​	
 

now, i'll simplify the numerator and the denominator step by step. starting with the numerator:

5
+
1
=
6
5+1=6

so, the numerator is 6.

next, the denominator:

3
(
5
)
=
15
3(5)=15

then, 
15
−
4
=
11
15−4=11

so, the denominator is 11.

therefore, 
f
(
5
)
=
6
11
f(5)= 
11
6

wait a minute, is that all? it seems straightforward, but maybe i should check if there's anything i'm missing. for instance, is there a restriction on the domain of the function that i should be aware of? like, values of x that make the denominator zero.

so, the denominator is 
3
x
−
4
3x−4, and i should ensure that it's not zero when i plug in x = 5.

let's see:

3
x
−
4
=
0
3x−4=0

3
x
=
4
3x=4

x
=
4
3
x= 
3
4
​	
 

okay, so the function is undefined at 
x
=
4
3
x= 
3
4
​	
 , but since i'm plugging in x = 5, which is not equal to 
4
3
3
4
​	
 , there's no issue here. the function is defined at x = 5.

just to be thorough, maybe i should consider if there are any asymptotes or anything like that, but for this problem, since i'm just evaluating the function at a specific point, that's probably not necessary.

alternatively, maybe i can graph the function to get a better understanding, but that might be overkill for this specific question.

wait, another thought: sometimes functions can be simplified before plugging in values, but in this case, the function is already in its simplest form. there's no factoring or canceling that can be done here.

so, i think my initial approach is correct. substitute x = 5 into the function, simplify numerator and denominator separately, and then divide.

let me double-check my arithmetic to be sure:

numerator: 5 + 1 = 6. that's correct.

denominator: 3 times 5 is 15, minus 4 is 11. that's also correct.

therefore, 
f
(
5
)
=
6
11
f(5)= 
11
6
​	
 

hmm, i feel confident about this answer, but maybe i should consider if there's a different way to approach this problem, just for practice.

alternatively, i could think about the behavior of the function as x approaches certain values, but again, that's beyond the scope of this problem.

perhaps, to ensure that i understand function notation properly, i can recall that 
f
(
a
)
f(a) means plugging a into the function wherever x appears.

so, in this case, wherever there is an x in the function, i replace it with 5.

another way to look at it is to consider the function as a machine that takes an input x and outputs 
x
+
1
3
x
−
4
3x−4
x+1
​	
 . so, if i input 5, it processes it as 
5
+
1
3
(
5
)
−
4
=
6
11
3(5)−4
5+1
​	
 = 
11
6
​	
 , which matches what i got earlier.

i think that's sufficient. i don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations.

just to recap:

1. identify the function: 
f
(
x
)
=
x
+
1
3
x
−
4
f(x)= 
3x−4
x+1
​	
 

2. plug in x = 5: 
f
(
5
)
=
5
+
1
3
(
5
)
−
4
f(5)= 
3(5)−4
5+1
​	
 

3. simplify numerator and denominator:

- numerator: 5 + 1 = 6

- denominator: 3*5 - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11

4. therefore, 
f
(
5
)
=
6
11
f(5)= 
11
6
​	
 

everything checks out. i'm satisfied with this answer.

**final answer**

6
11
