Reasoning: I've got this algebra problem to solve: i need to factor the expression \[(9x^5 + 25x^3 - 4) - (x^5 - 3x^3 - 4).\] hmm, okay, let's take it step by step.

first, i should probably simplify this expression before trying to factor it. so, i need to distribute the negative sign through the second set of parentheses. that means i'll subtract each term inside the parentheses.

so, starting with \[(9x^5 + 25x^3 - 4) - (x^5 - 3x^3 - 4),\] i'll distribute the negative sign:

9
x
5
+
25
x
3
−
4
−
x
5
+
3
x
3
+
4.
9x 
5
 +25x 
3
 −4−x 
5
 +3x 
3
 +4.
now, let's combine like terms. the like terms are the ones with the same power of x.

first, the 
x
5
x 
5
  terms: 
9
x
5
−
x
5
=
8
x
5
.
9x 
5
 −x 
5
 =8x 
5
 .

next, the 
x
3
x 
3
  terms: 
25
x
3
+
3
x
3
=
28
x
3
.
25x 
3
 +3x 
3
 =28x 
3
 .

lastly, the constant terms: 
−
4
+
4
=
0.
−4+4=0.

so, after combining like terms, the expression simplifies to:

8
x
5
+
28
x
3
.
8x 
5
 +28x 
3
 .
now, i need to factor this expression completely. let's see what's common in both terms.

both terms have an 
x
3
x 
3
  in them, and also, 8 and 28 are both divisible by 4. so, i can factor out 
4
x
3
4x 
3
 :

4
x
3
(
2
x
2
+
7
)
.
4x 
3
 (2x 
2
 +7).
wait a minute, is that the final factored form? let me check if i can factor it further.

looking at the expression inside the parentheses, 
2
x
2
+
7
2x 
2
 +7, i don't think that can be factored any further using real numbers because it doesn't have real roots. the discriminant would be 
0
2
−
4
∗
2
∗
7
=
−
56
0 
2
 −4∗2∗7=−56, which is negative, so no real roots.

therefore, the completely factored form of the original expression is:

4
x
3
(
2
x
2
+
7
)
.
4x 
3
 (2x 
2
 +7).
let me just double-check my steps to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

1. distribute the negative sign: correct.

2. combine like terms: 
9
x
5
−
x
5
=
8
x

9x

 =8x

x

3
 +3x 
3
 =28x 
3
 , 
−
4
+
4
=
0
−4+4=0: correct.

3. factor out 
4
x
3
4x 
3
 : yes, because 8 and 28 are both divisible by 4, and both terms have at least 
x
3
x 
3
 .

4. check if 
2
x
2
+
7
2x 
2
 +7 can be factored further: it can't, since it has no real roots.

so, i think that's the final answer.

**final answer**

4x 
3
 (2x 
2
 +7)
