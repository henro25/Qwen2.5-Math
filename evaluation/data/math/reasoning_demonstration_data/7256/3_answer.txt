Answer: First, simplify the given expression by distributing the negative sign through the second set of parentheses:

\[
(9x^5 + 25x^3 - 4) - (x^5 - 3x^3 - 4) = 9x^5 + 25x^3 - 4 - x^5 + 3x^3 + 4
\]

next, combine like terms:

\[
9x^5 - x^5 = 8x^5
\]
\[
25x^3 + 3x^3 = 28x^3
\]
\[
-4 + 4 = 0
\]

this simplifies to:

\[
8x^5 + 28x^3
\]

now, factor out the greatest common factor, which is \(4x^3\):

\[
8x^5 + 28x^3 = 4x^3(2x^2 + 7)
\]

since \(2x^2 + 7\) cannot be factored further using real numbers, the completely factored form of the expression is:

\[
\boxed{4x^3(2x^2 + 7)}
\]
