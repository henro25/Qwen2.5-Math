Reasoning: So juan is rolling an 8-sided die, and amal is rolling a 6-sided die. i need to find the probability that the product of their rolls is a multiple of 3. hmm, okay, let's break this down.

first, i should understand what it means for a product to be a multiple of 3. a number is a multiple of 3 if it has 3 as one of its factors. so, the product of the two numbers will be a multiple of 3 if at least one of the numbers is a multiple of 3.

wait, actually, more precisely, the product is a multiple of 3 if at least one of the numbers is divisible by 3. because if either number is divisible by 3, then the product will be divisible by 3.

so, to find the probability that the product is a multiple of 3, i can find the probability that at least one of the numbers rolled is a multiple of 3.

alternatively, i could find the probability that neither number is a multiple of 3, and then subtract that from 1 to get the desired probability. that might be easier.

let me try that approach.

first, find the probability that juan's roll is not a multiple of 3, and amal's roll is not a multiple of 3.

then, the probability that neither is a multiple of 3 is the product of these two probabilities, since the rolls are independent.

finally, the probability that at least one is a multiple of 3 is 1 minus that probability.

alright, let's find the probability that juan's roll is not a multiple of 3.

juan is rolling an 8-sided die with numbers 1 through 8.

so, the possible outcomes are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

which of these are multiples of 3? let's see:

3 and 6 are multiples of 3.

so, there are 2 multiples of 3 out of 8 possible outcomes.

therefore, the probability that juan rolls a multiple of 3 is 2/8, which simplifies to 1/4.

therefore, the probability that juan does not roll a multiple of 3 is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.

now, let's find the probability that amal's roll is not a multiple of 3.

amal is rolling a 6-sided die with numbers 1 through 6.

which of these are multiples of 3? 3 and 6.

so, there are 2 multiples of 3 out of 6 possible outcomes.

therefore, the probability that amal rolls a multiple of 3 is 2/6, which simplifies to 1/3.

therefore, the probability that amal does not roll a multiple of 3 is 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.

now, since the two events are independent, the probability that neither juan nor amal rolls a multiple of 3 is (3/4) * (2/3) = 6/12 = 1/2.

therefore, the probability that at least one of them rolls a multiple of 3 is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

so, the probability is 1/2.

wait a second, is that correct? let me double-check.

alternative approach: find the probability that the product is a multiple of 3 directly.

the product is a multiple of 3 if at least one of the numbers is a multiple of 3.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider all possible pairs and count how many have at least one multiple of 3.

but that would be time-consuming since there are 8 * 6 = 48 possible outcomes.

wait, but maybe there's a smarter way.

alternatively, i can consider that the product is a multiple of 3 if and only if at least one of the numbers is a multiple of 3.

so, using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the probability that juan rolls a multiple of 3 or amal rolls a multiple of 3 is equal to the probability that juan rolls a multiple of 3 plus the probability that amal rolls a multiple of 3 minus the probability that both roll multiples of 3.

so, p(juan multiple of 3 or amal multiple of 3) = p(juan multiple of 3) + p(amal multiple of 3) - p(juan multiple of 3 and amal multiple of 3).

we already have p(juan multiple of 3) = 1/4, p(amal multiple of 3) = 1/3.

and since the rolls are independent, p(both multiples of 3) = (1/4)*(1/3) = 1/12.

therefore, p(juan multiple of 3 or amal multiple of 3) = 1/4 + 1/3 - 1/12.

to add these fractions, i need a common denominator, which is 12.

so, 1/4 = 3/12, 1/3 = 4/12, and 1/12 remains the same.

therefore, 3/12 + 4/12 - 1/12 = 6/12 = 1/2.

so, again, i get 1/2.

hmm, consistent with the previous method.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the cases where juan rolls a multiple of 3, or amal rolls a multiple of 3, but not both, and then add the case where both roll multiples of 3.

but that seems more complicated, and i already have consistent answers from two different methods.

therefore, i'm confident that the probability is 1/2.

so, the final answer is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{2}}
