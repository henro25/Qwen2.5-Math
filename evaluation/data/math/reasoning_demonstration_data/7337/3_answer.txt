Answer: Juan rolls a fair 8-sided die, and amal rolls a fair 6-sided die. we need to find the probability that the product of their rolls is a multiple of 3.

first, we find the probability that neither roll is a multiple of 3.

for juan's roll (1 through 8):
- multiples of 3: 3, 6 (2 out of 8)
- probability of not rolling a multiple of 3: \(1 - \frac{2}{8} = \frac{3}{4}\)

for amal's roll (1 through 6):
- multiples of 3: 3, 6 (2 out of 6)
- probability of not rolling a multiple of 3: \(1 - \frac{2}{6} = \frac{2}{3}\)

the probability that neither rolls a multiple of 3 is:
\[
\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

therefore, the probability that at least one of them rolls a multiple of 3 is:
\[
1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}
\]
