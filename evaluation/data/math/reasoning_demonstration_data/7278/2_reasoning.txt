Reasoning: Alright, so I've got this math problem here: 9 cubed plus 3 times 9 squared plus 3 times 9 plus 1. Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of this expression. Hmm, I remember that when you have something like x cubed plus 3x squared plus 3x plus 1, it looks familiar. Isn't that like the expansion of (x + 1) cubed? Yeah, I think that's right. So maybe I can use that to simplify this problem instead of calculating each term separately.

Let me double-check that formula. (x + 1)^3 equals x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1. Yep, that matches exactly what I have here. So if x is 9, then this whole expression should be equal to (9 + 1)^3, which is 10 cubed. And 10 cubed is 1000. So, is the answer just 1000? That seems too easy. Maybe I should verify by calculating each part separately to make sure I'm not making a mistake.

Alright, let's do it the long way. First, 9 cubed is 9 times 9 times 9. 9 times 9 is 81, and 81 times 9 is 729. Okay, so 9^3 is 729.

Next, 3 times 9 squared. 9 squared is 81, and 3 times 81 is 243. So, 3(9^2) is 243.

Then, 3 times 9 is 27. So, 3(9) is 27.

Finally, there's just a +1 at the end.

Now, if I add all these up: 729 plus 243 is 972. Then, 972 plus 27 is 1000, and 1000 plus 1 is 1001.

Wait a minute, earlier I thought it was 1000, but now I'm getting 1001. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?

Let me go back to the formula. I thought (x + 1)^3 is x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1. Let's plug in x = 9. So, (9 + 1)^3 is 10^3, which is 1000. But when I add up the separate parts, I got 1001. That doesn't make sense. There must be a mistake in my calculation.

Let me check the addition again. 729 plus 243 is indeed 972. Then, 972 plus 27 is 1000, not 999 or 1001. Wait, no, 972 plus 27 is 999, and then plus 1 is 1000. Oh, I see, I must have added wrong earlier.

So, 972 plus 27 is 999, and 999 plus 1 is 1000. That matches the formula. So, the answer is 1000.

Maybe I was confused with the addition before. It's easy to make a mistake when adding large numbers quickly. So, it's better to take it step by step.

Another way to look at it is to recognize the pattern in the expression. The expression 9^3 + 3(9^2) + 3(9) + 1 is the expansion of (9 + 1)^3, which simplifies directly to 10^3 or 1000. Recognizing such patterns can save a lot of time and reduce the chance of calculation errors.

I think I'm confident now that the answer is 1000. I just need to be careful with my addition to avoid silly mistakes.
