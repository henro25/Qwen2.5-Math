Answer: To solve the expression \( 9^3 + 3(9^2) + 3(9) + 1 \), we can recognize that it fits the pattern of the binomial expansion formula:

\[
(x + 1)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1
\]

Substituting \( x = 9 \), the expression simplifies to:

\[
(9 + 1)^3 = 10^3 = 1000
\]

For verification, we can calculate each term individually:

1. \( 9^3 = 729 \)
2. \( 3(9^2) = 3 \times 81 = 243 \)
3. \( 3(9) = 27 \)
4. Add the constant term: \( +1 \)

Now, summing these values:

\[
729 + 243 = 972
\]
\[
972 + 27 = 999
\]
\[
999 + 1 = 1000
\]

Thus, the value of the expression is **1000**.
