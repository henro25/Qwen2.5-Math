Reasoning: So i have this equation to solve: 
r
+
9
r
−
3
=
r
−
2
r
+
5
r−3
r+9
​	
 = 
r+5
r−2
​	
 . alright, let's see how to approach this. i remember that when you have two fractions equal to each other, you can cross-multiply to solve for the variable. so, i'll try that.

first, i'll cross-multiply the denominators and numerators:

(
r
+
9
)
(
r
+
5
)
=
(
r
−
2
)
(
r
−
3
)
(r+9)(r+5)=(r−2)(r−3)

now, i need to expand both sides of this equation. let's start with the left side:

(
r
+
9
)
(
r
+
5
)
=
r
⋅
r
+
r
⋅
5
+
9
⋅
r
+
9
⋅
5
=
r
2
+
5
r
+
9
r
+
45
=
r
2
+
14
r
+
45
(r+9)(r+5)=r⋅r+r⋅5+9⋅r+9⋅5=r 
2
 +5r+9r+45=r 
2
 +14r+45

okay, that seems right. now, the right side:

(
r
−
2
)
(
r
−
3
)
=
r
⋅
r
+
r
⋅
(
−
3
)
+
(
−
2
)
⋅
r
+
(
−
2
)
⋅
(
−
3
)
=
r
2
−
3
r
−
2
r
+
6
=
r
2
−
5
r
+
6
(r−2)(r−3)=r⋅r+r⋅(−3)+(−2)⋅r+(−2)⋅(−3)=r 
2
 −3r−2r+6=r 
2
 −5r+6

alright, so now the equation is:

r
2
+
14
r
+
45
=
r
2
−
5
r
+
6
r 
2
 +14r+45=r 
2
 −5r+6

hmm, both sides have 
r
2
r 
2
 , maybe i can subtract 
r
2
r 
2
  from both sides to simplify:

r
2
+
14
r
+
45
−
r
2
=
r
2
−
5
r
+
6
−
r
2
r 
2
 +14r+45−r 
2
 =r 
2
 −5r+6−r 
2
 

which simplifies to:

14
r
+
45
=
−
5
r
+
6
14r+45=−5r+6

now, i need to get all the r terms on one side and the constants on the other. let's add 
5
r
5r to both sides:

14
r
+
5
r
+
45
=
6
14r+5r+45=6

which is:

19
r
+
45
=
6
19r+45=6

next, subtract 45 from both sides:

19
r
=
6
−
45
19r=6−45

19
r
=
−
39
19r=−39

now, divide both sides by 19 to solve for r:

r
=
−
39
19
r= 
19
−39
​	
 

wait a minute, let me double-check that. is 
−
39
19
19
−39
​	
  the simplest form? well, 39 and 19 don't have any common factors besides 1, so i guess that's fine.

but let me make sure i didn't make any mistakes earlier. i'll plug this value back into the original equation to verify.

original equation: 
r
+
9
r
−
3
=
r
−
2
r
+
5
r−3
r+9
​	
 = 
r+5
r−2
​	
 

plugging in 
r
=
−
39
19
r= 
19
−39
​	
 :

left side: 
−
39
19
+
9
−
39
19
−
3
19
−39
​	
 −3
19
−39
​	
 +9
​	
 

first, calculate the numerator:

−
39
19
+
9
=
−
39
19
+
171
19
=
132
19
19
−39
​	
 +9= 
19
−39
​	
 + 
19
171
​	
 = 
19
132
​	
 

now, the denominator:

−
39
19
−
3
=
−
39
19
−
57
19
=
−
96
19
19
−39
​	
 −3= 
19
−39
​	
 − 
19
57
​	
 = 
19
−96
​	
 

so, the left side is 
132
19
−
96
19
=
132
−
96
=
−
11
8
19
−96
​	
 
19
132
​	
 
​	
 = 
−96
132
​	
 =− 
8
11
​	
 

now, the right side:

−
39
19
−
2
−
39
19
+
5
19
−39
​	
 +5
19
−39
​	
 −2
​	
 

first, numerator:

−
39
19
−
2
=
−
39
19
−
38
19
=
−
77
19
19
−39
​	
 −2= 
19
−39
​	
 − 
19
38
​	
 = 
19
−77
​	
 

denominator:

−
39
19
+
5
=
−
39
19
+
95
19
=
56
19
19
−39
​	
 +5= 
19
−39
​	
 + 
19
95
​	
 = 
19
56
​	
 

so, the right side is 
−
77
19
56
19
=
−
77
56
=
−
11
8
19
56
​	
 
19
−77
​	
 
​	
 = 
56
−77
​	
 =− 
8
11
​	
 

both sides equal 
−
11
8
− 
8
11
​	
 , so it checks out. therefore, 
r
=
−
39
19
r= 
19
−39
​	
  is the correct solution.

wait, but maybe i should consider if there are any restrictions on r. the original equation has denominators 
r
−
3
r−3 and 
r
+
5
r+5, so r cannot be 3 or -5, because that would make the denominators zero. but 
−
39
19
19
−39
​	
  is approximately -2.05, which is not 3 or -5, so it's acceptable.

is there any other solution? let me think. the equation after cross-multiplying led to a linear equation in r, which should have only one solution, unless there was some mistake in the steps.

alternatively, maybe i can solve it by finding a common denominator or something, but cross-multiplying seems straightforward and it worked. i don't see any errors in the steps i took.

so, i think 
r
=
−
39
19
r= 
19
−39
​	
  is the correct and only solution to the equation.

**final answer**

−
39
19
