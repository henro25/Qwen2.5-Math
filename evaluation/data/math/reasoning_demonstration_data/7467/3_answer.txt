Answer: To solve the equation \(\frac{r+9}{r-3} = \frac{r-2}{r+5}\), we start by cross-multiplying:

\[
(r + 9)(r + 5) = (r - 2)(r - 3)
\]

expanding both sides, we get:

\[
r^2 + 14r + 45 = r^2 - 5r + 6
\]

subtracting \(r^2\) from both sides simplifies to:

\[
14r + 45 = -5r + 6
\]

adding \(5r\) to both sides:

\[
19r + 45 = 6
\]

subtracting 45 from both sides:

\[
19r = -39
\]

dividing both sides by 19:

\[
r = \frac{-39}{19}
\]

to verify, we substitute \(r = \frac{-39}{19}\) back into the original equation and check both sides:

left side:

\[
\frac{\frac{-39}{19} + 9}{\frac{-39}{19} - 3} = \frac{\frac{132}{19}}{\frac{-96}{19}} = -\frac{11}{8}
\]

right side:

\[
\frac{\frac{-39}{19} - 2}{\frac{-39}{19} + 5} = \frac{\frac{-77}{19}}{\frac{56}{19}} = -\frac{11}{8}
\]

both sides are equal, confirming the solution. additionally, \(r = \frac{-39}{19}\) does not make any denominators zero, so it is valid.

thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{-\dfrac{39}{19}}
\]
