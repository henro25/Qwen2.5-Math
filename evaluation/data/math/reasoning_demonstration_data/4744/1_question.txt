Problem: Two of the vertices of a regular octahedron are to be chosen at random. What is the probability that they will be the endpoints of an edge of the octahedron? Express your answer as a common fraction. [asy]
size(150);
pair A, B, C, D, E, F;
A=(1,1);
B=(-1,-1);
C=(0,6);
D=(0,-6);
E=(6, 0);
F=(-6,0);
draw(C--F--D--E--C--B--F);
draw(D--B--E);
draw(F--A--C, dashed);
draw(D--A--E, dashed);
