Problem: "Modulo $m$ graph paper" consists of a grid of $m^2$ points, representing all pairs of integer residues $(x,y)$ where $0\le x, y <m$. To graph a congruence on modulo $m$ graph paper, we mark every point $(x,y)$ that satisfies the congruence. For example, a graph of $y\equiv x^2\pmod 5$ would consist of the points $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(2,4)$, $(3,4)$, and $(4,1)$.

The graph of $$3x\equiv 4y-1 \pmod{35}$$has a single $x$-intercept $(x_0,0)$ and a single $y$-intercept $(0,y_0)$, where $0\le x_0,y_0<35$.

What is the value of $x_0+y_0$?
