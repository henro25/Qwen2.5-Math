Reasoning: Let's tackle this problem step by step. so, we have p and q that are inversely proportional. i need to find the value of p when q is 15, given that p is 25 when q is 6.

first, i need to recall what it means for two variables to be inversely proportional. if p and q are inversely proportional, that means their product is a constant. in other words, p times q equals some constant k. so, p * q = k.

given that p = 25 when q = 6, i can plug these values into the equation to find k. so, 25 * 6 = k, which means k = 150.

now, i need to find p when q = 15. using the same formula, p * q = k, and i know q is 15 and k is 150. so, p * 15 = 150.

to find p, i can divide both sides of the equation by 15. that gives me p = 150 / 15.

let me calculate that: 150 divided by 15 is 10.

so, p should be 10 when q is 15.

wait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure i didn't make any mistakes. if p is inversely proportional to q, then as q increases, p should decrease, right? here, q is increasing from 6 to 15, which is more than double, and p is decreasing from 25 to 10, which makes sense because they're inversely proportional.

alternatively, i can think about the relationship in terms of ratios. since p and q are inversely proportional, the ratio of p1 to p2 should be equal to q2 to q1. so, p1/q2 = p2/q1.

let me plug in the known values: 25 / 15 = p / 6.

cross-multiplying, 25 * 6 = 15 * p, which is 150 = 15p.

then, p = 150 / 15 = 10.

that matches what i got earlier, so i think that's correct.

another way to look at it is to use the formula for inverse proportionality directly. since p * q = k, and k is constant, i can set up the equation as p1 * q1 = p2 * q2.

plugging in the known values: 25 * 6 = p * 15.

again, 150 = 15p, so p = 10.

consistently getting the same answer reinforces that p is indeed 10 when q is 15.

i don't think there's any other factor i'm missing here. the relationship is straightforward inverse proportionality, and i've checked it using multiple methods.

just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that p and q could have a different kind of relationship, but the problem specifically states that they are inversely proportional, so i don't need to consider direct proportionality or any other type of relationship.

therefore, the final answer should be p = 10 when q = 15.
