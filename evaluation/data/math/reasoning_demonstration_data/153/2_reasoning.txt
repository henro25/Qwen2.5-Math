Reasoning: 
So i need to expand the product 
(
3
x
+
2
y
+
1
)
(
x
+
4
y
+
5
)
(3x+2y+1)(x+4y+5). alright, let's see how to approach this. i remember that to expand two polynomials, i have to use the distributive property, which means multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms.

first, i'll list out the terms in each polynomial:

first polynomial: 
3
x
3x, 
2
y
2y, and 
1
1

second polynomial: 
x
x, 
4
y
4y, and 
5
5

so, i need to multiply each of these three terms by each of these three terms and then add them all up.

let's start with the first term of the first polynomial, which is 
3
x
3x, and multiply it by each term in the second polynomial.

3
x
×
x
=
3
x
2
3x×x=3x 
2
 

3
x
×
4
y
=
12
x
y
3x×4y=12xy

3
x
×
5
=
15
x
3x×5=15x

okay, that's the first part. now, i'll take the second term of the first polynomial, which is 
2
y
2y, and multiply it by each term in the second polynomial.

2
y
×
x
=
2
x
y
2y×x=2xy

2
y
×
4
y
=
8
y
2
2y×4y=8y 
2
 

2
y
×
5
=
10
y
2y×5=10y

alright, moving on to the third term of the first polynomial, which is 
1
1, and multiply it by each term in the second polynomial.

1
×
x
=
x
1×x=x

1
×
4
y
=
4
y
1×4y=4y

1
×
5
=
5
1×5=5

now, i have all the individual products:

3
x
2
3x 
2
 , 
12
x
y
12xy, 
15
x
15x, 
2
x
y
2xy, 
8
y
2
8y 
2
 , 
10
y
10y, 
x
x, 
4
y
4y, and 
5
5.

next step is to combine like terms. like terms are terms that have the same variables raised to the same powers.

let's identify the like terms:

- 
3
x
2
3x 
2
 : there are no other 
x
2
x 
2
  terms.

- 
12
x
y
12xy and 
2
x
y
2xy: both have 
x
y
xy.

- 
15
x
15x and 
x
x: both have 
x
x.

- 
8
y
2
8y 
2
 : there are no other 
y
2
y 
2
  terms.

- 
10
y
10y and 
4
y
4y: both have 
y
y.

- 
5
5: constant term.

so, let's add them up:

3
x
2
3x 
2
  stays as it is.

12
x
y
+
2
x
y
=
14
x
y
12xy+2xy=14xy

15
x
+
x
=
16
x
15x+x=16x

8
y
2
8y 
2
  stays as it is.

10
y
+
4
y
=
14
y
10y+4y=14y

and the constant term is 
5
5.

so, putting it all together:

3
x
2
+
14
x
y
+
16
x
+
8
y
2
+
14
y
+
5
3x 
2
 +14xy+16x+8y 
2
 +14y+5

i think that's the expanded form of the original product.

let me just double-check to make sure i didn't miss anything.

starting with 
3
x
3x multiplied by each term in the second polynomial: 
3
x
2
3x 
2
 , 
12
x
y
12xy, 
15
x
15x — that's correct.

then 
2
y
2y multiplied by each term: 
2
x
y
2xy, 
8
y
2
8y 
2
 , 
10
y
10y — correct.

finally, 
1
1 multiplied by each term: 
x
x, 
4
y
4y, 
5
5 — correct.

combining like terms: 
12
x
y
+
2
x
y
=
14
x
y
12xy+2xy=14xy, 
15
x
+
x
=
16
x
15x+x=16x, 
10
y
+
4
y
=
14
y
10y+4y=14y — that all looks good.

so, the final expanded form should be:

3
x
2
+
14
x
y
+
16
x
+
8
y
2
+
14
y
+
5
3x 
2
 +14xy+16x+8y 
2
 +14y+5

i don't think there are any further simplifications needed since there are no more like terms to combine.

**final answer**

3
x
2
+
14
x
y
+
16
x
+
8
y
2
+
14
y
+
5
3x 
2
 +14xy+16x+8y 
2
 +14y+5
