Answer: To expand the product \((3x + 2y + 1)(x + 4y + 5)\), we use the distributive property to multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combine like terms.

first, we multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:

\[
\begin{align*}
3x \times x &= 3x^2, \\
3x \times 4y &= 12xy, \\
3x \times 5 &= 15x, \\
2y \times x &= 2xy, \\
2y \times 4y &= 8y^2, \\
2y \times 5 &= 10y, \\
1 \times x &= x, \\
1 \times 4y &= 4y, \\
1 \times 5 &= 5.
\end{align*}
\]

next, we combine the like terms:

\[
\begin{align*}
3x^2 & \text{ (no like terms)}, \\
12xy + 2xy &= 14xy, \\
15x + x &= 16x, \\
8y^2 & \text{ (no like terms)}, \\
10y + 4y &= 14y, \\
5 & \text{ (constant term)}.
\end{align*}
\]

thus, the expanded form of the product is:

\[
\boxed{3x^2 + 14xy + 16x + 8y^2 + 14y + 5}
\]
