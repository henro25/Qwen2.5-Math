Reasoning: Alright, so I've got this problem here about a regular polygon with each exterior angle measuring 15 degrees, and I need to find out how many sides it has. Okay, let's see. I remember that polygons have these angles associated with them, both interior and exterior. I think the exterior angles are the ones you get when you extend one side and look at the angle outside the polygon.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definitions. Let me try to recall. So, for any polygon, the sum of the exterior angles is always 360 degrees, right? I think that's a rule I learned somewhere. And for a regular polygon, which means all sides and angles are equal, each exterior angle would be the same.

So, if each exterior angle is 15 degrees, and the total of all exterior angles is 360 degrees, maybe I can just divide 360 by 15 to find out how many exterior angles there are, which should be the same as the number of sides. That sounds logical. Let me do that calculation: 360 divided by 15.

360 divided by 15 is... let's see, 15 times 24 is 360, so that would be 24 sides. Okay, that seems straightforward, but I feel like I should double-check if this makes sense. Maybe I should think about smaller polygons to see if the pattern holds.

Take a triangle, for example. A regular triangle, or equilateral triangle, has exterior angles of 120 degrees each because the interior angles are 60 degrees, and the exterior is 180 minus 60, which is 120. Wait, but 360 divided by 120 is 3, which matches the number of sides. So, that works.

How about a square? Each interior angle is 90 degrees, so the exterior angle is 90 degrees as well? Wait, no, that's not right. The exterior angle should be 180 minus 90, which is 90 degrees, but if I do 360 divided by 90, I get 4, which matches the number of sides. Wait, but actually, in a square, each exterior angle is 90 degrees, but that doesn't seem right because if you turn 90 degrees at each corner when walking around the polygon, you'd make a full circle in four turns, which makes sense.

Let me check a pentagon. A regular pentagon has interior angles of 108 degrees each, so the exterior angles should be 72 degrees. If I do 360 divided by 72, I get 5, which is correct for a pentagon. So, the pattern holds.

Okay, so applying this to the problem at hand, with each exterior angle being 15 degrees, dividing 360 by 15 should give me the number of sides. And as I calculated earlier, that's 24 sides.

But just to make sure, maybe there's another way to approach this. I recall that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is (n-2)*180 degrees, where n is the number of sides. And for a regular polygon, each interior angle is the same, so each interior angle would be ((n-2)*180)/n degrees.

If I know the exterior angle is 15 degrees, and since the interior and exterior angles are supplementary (they add up to 180 degrees), then each interior angle should be 180 minus 15, which is 165 degrees.

Let me plug that into the interior angle formula: 165 = ((n-2)*180)/n.

Now, I need to solve for n. Let's see:

165n = (n-2)*180

165n = 180n - 360

Subtract 165n from both sides:

0 = 15n - 360

Add 360 to both sides:

15n = 360

Divide both sides by 15:

n = 24

Okay, so that confirms my earlier answer of 24 sides. It seems consistent both ways, so I'm pretty confident that's the correct number of sides for the polygon.
