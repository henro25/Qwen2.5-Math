Problem: A plane is expressed parametrically by
\[\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 + s - t \\ 2 - s \\ 3 - 2s + 2t \end{pmatrix}.\]Find the equation of the plane.  Enter your answer in the form
\[Ax + By + Cz + D = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D$ are integers such that $A > 0$ and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|) = 1.$
