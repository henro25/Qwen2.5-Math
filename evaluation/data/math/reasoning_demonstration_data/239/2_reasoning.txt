Reasoning: So i've got this quadratic equation problem here. it says that the quadratic equation 
x
2
+
m
x
+
n
=
0
x 
2
 +mx+n=0 has roots that are twice those of another quadratic equation 
x
2
+
p
x
+
m
=
0
x 
2
 +px+m=0, and none of 
m
m, 
n
n, and 
p
p is zero. i need to find the value of 
n
p
p
n
​
 .

alright, let's start by recalling some basics about quadratic equations. for a general quadratic equation 
x
2
+
b
x
+
c
=
0
x 
2
 +bx+c=0, the sum of the roots is 
−
b
−b and the product of the roots is 
c
c. that's from vieta's formulas.

so, for the first equation 
x
2
+
m
x
+
n
=
0
x 
2
 +mx+n=0, the sum of the roots is 
−
m
−m and the product is 
n
n.

for the second equation 
x
2
+
p
x
+
m
=
0
x 
2
 +px+m=0, the sum of the roots is 
−
p
−p and the product is 
m
m.

now, it's given that the roots of the first equation are twice those of the second equation. let's denote the roots of the second equation as 
r
r and 
s
s. then, the roots of the first equation would be 
2
r
2r and 
2
s
2s.

using vieta's formulas for the second equation:

1. 
r
+
s
=
−
p
r+s=−p (sum of roots)

2. 
r
⋅
s
=
m
r⋅s=m (product of roots)

and for the first equation:

1. 
2
r
+
2
s
=
−
m
2r+2s=−m (sum of roots)

2. 
(
2
r
)
⋅
(
2
s
)
=
n
(2r)⋅(2s)=n (product of roots)

so, from the sum of the roots of the first equation:

2
r
+
2
s
=
−
m
2r+2s=−m

i can factor out the 2:

2
(
r
+
s
)
=
−
m
2(r+s)=−m

but from the second equation, 
r
+
s
=
−
p
r+s=−p, so substituting:

2
(
−
p
)
=
−
m
2(−p)=−m

simplifying:

−
2
p
=
−
m
−2p=−m

multiply both sides by -1:

2
p
=
m
2p=m

so, 
m
=
2
p
m=2p. that's one relationship.

now, looking at the product of the roots for the first equation:

(
2
r
)
(
2
s
)
=
n
(2r)(2s)=n

which simplifies to:

4
r
s
=
n
4rs=n

but from the second equation, 
r
s
=
m
rs=m, so:

4
m
=
n
4m=n

but earlier, we found that 
m
=
2
p
m=2p, so substitute that in:

4
(
2
p
)
=
n
4(2p)=n

which means:

8
p
=
n
8p=n

so, 
n
=
8
p
n=8p

now, the question is asking for 
n
p
p
n
​
 , so:

n
p
=
8
p
p
=
8
p
n
​
 = 
p
8p
​
 =8

wait a minute, that seems straightforward. but let me double-check to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

first, i set the roots of the second equation as 
r
r and 
s
s, so the roots of the first equation are 
2
r
2r and 
2
s
2s. then, i applied vieta's formulas correctly for both equations.

from the sum of the roots of the first equation: 
2
r
+
2
s
=
−
m
2r+2s=−m, which led to 
m
=
2
p
m=2p, since 
r
+
s
=
−
p
r+s=−p.

from the product of the roots: 
4
r
s
=
n
4rs=n, and since 
r
s
=
m
rs=m, then 
n
=
4
m
n=4m, and substituting 
m
=
2
p
m=2p, we get 
n
=
8
p
n=8p.

therefore, 
n
p
=
8
p
n
​
 =8. that seems correct.

but just to be thorough, maybe i should consider if there's another way to approach this problem, perhaps using substitution or elimination.

alternatively, i could express everything in terms of one variable and solve for the ratios.

let me try that.

let’s denote the roots of the second equation 
x
2
+
p
x
+
m
=
0
x 
2
 +px+m=0 as 
α
α and 
β
β. then, the roots of the first equation 
x
2
+
m
x
+
n
=
0
x 
2
 +mx+n=0 are 
2
α
2α and 
2
β
2β.

from vieta's formulas for the second equation:

α
+
β
=
−
p
α+β=−p

α
β
=
m
αβ=m

for the first equation:

2
α
+
2
β
=
−
m
2α+2β=−m → 
2
(
α
+
β
)
=
−
m
2(α+β)=−m → 
2
(
−
p
)
=
−
m
2(−p)=−m → 
−
2
p
=
−
m
−2p=−m → 
m
=
2
p
m=2p

and the product:

(
2
α
)
(
2
β
)
=
n
(2α)(2β)=n → 
4
α
β
=
n
4αβ=n → 
4
m
=
n
4m=n (since 
α
β
=
m
αβ=m)

but since 
m
=
2
p
m=2p, then 
n
=
4
(
2
p
)
=
8
p
n=4(2p)=8p

so again, 
n
p
=
8
p
n
​
 =8

this confirms my previous result.

is there any other way this could be approached? maybe by substituting one equation into the other.

let’s try expressing 
n
n in terms of 
m
m, and 
m
m in terms of 
p
p, and then find 
n
p
p
n
​
 .

from earlier, 
m
=
2
p
m=2p and 
n
=
4
m
n=4m, so 
n
=
4
(
2
p
)
=
8
p
n=4(2p)=8p, hence 
n
p
=
8
p
n
​
 =8

alternatively, perhaps using the fact that if one quadratic is a transformation of another, there might be a relationship between their coefficients.

but in this case, since the roots are scaled by a factor, the relationships we've derived seem sufficient.

let me consider if there are any special cases or if any assumptions might have been overlooked.

the problem states that none of 
m
m, 
n
n, and 
p
p is zero, which is good because we had steps where we divided by these variables, so no division by zero issues.

also, since the quadratics have real coefficients and roots, we don't have to worry about complex numbers in this context.

i think the solution is solid. the value of 
n
p
p
n
​
  is 8.

**final answer**

8
