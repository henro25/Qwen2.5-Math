Reasoning: Let's tackle this problem step by step. so, brenda is going from the point (-4, 5) to (5, -4), and she needs to stop by the origin, which is (0,0), on her way. we need to find out how far she has to travel in total.

first, i should probably visualize this to understand what's going on. we have three points: a(-4,5), o(0,0), and b(5,-4). brenda starts at a, goes to o, and then to b.

to find the total distance she travels, i need to calculate the distance from a to o and then from o to b, and add those two distances together.

i recall that the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in a plane can be found using the distance formula, which is:

distance
=
(
x
2
−
x
1
)
2
+
(
y
2
−
y
1
)
2
distance= 
(x2−x1) 
2
 +(y2−y1) 
2
 
​	
 
so, let's apply this formula to find the distance from a to o.

point a is (-4, 5) and o is (0, 0).

plugging into the formula:

distance from a to o
=
(
0
−
(
−
4
)
)
2
+
(
0
−
5
)
2
distance from a to o= 
(0−(−4))

 +(0−5)

+
25
= 
16+25
​	
 
=
41
= 
41
​	
 
okay, so the distance from a to o is √41.

now, let's find the distance from o to b.

point o is (0,0) and b is (5, -4).

using the distance formula again:

distance from o to b
=
(
5
−
0
)
2
+
(
−

−

)
2
distance from o to b=

= 
25+16
​	
 
=

=

​	
 
interesting, the distance from o to b is also √41.

so, the total distance brenda travels is the sum of these two distances:

wait a minute, is there a simpler way to look at this? maybe i can think about the straight-line distance from a to b and see how it relates to the path through o.

let's calculate the straight-line distance from a to b.

point a is (-4,5) and b is (5,-4).

using the distance formula:

distance from a to b

(

(
−

hmm, so the straight-line distance from a to b is 9√2, but brenda is not taking that direct path; she's going through o, which adds some extra distance.

but according to my earlier calculation, the total distance through o is 2√41. i wonder how 2√41 compares to 9√2.

let me calculate the numerical values to get a sense of it.

first, √41 is approximately 6.403, so 2√41 is about 12.806.

and √2 is approximately 1.414, so 9√2 is about 12.728.

these are very close, but not exactly the same. that makes sense because brenda is taking a detour through o, which should make the path longer than the straight line, but in this case, it's almost the same length. maybe i made a mistake somewhere.

let me double-check my calculations.

starting with distance a to o:

(

​

​

​	
 
that's correct.

distance o to b:

5 
2
 +(−4) 
2
 
​	
 = 
25+16
​	
 = 
41
​	
 
also correct.

total distance: √41 + √41 = 2√41.

and distance a to b directly is 9√2.

numerically, 2√41 ≈ 12.806 and 9√2 ≈ 12.728. so, brenda's path through o is indeed slightly longer, as expected.

alternatively, maybe there's a geometric interpretation here. let me see if points a, o, and b have any special properties.

looking at coordinates:

a(-4,5), o(0,0), b(5,-4)

i can check if o is the midpoint of a and b.

the midpoint formula is:

(
x
1
+
x
2
2
,
y
1
+
y
2
2
)
( 
2
x1+x2
​	
 , 
2
y1+y2
​	
 )
so, midpoint of a and b would be:

(
−
4
+
5
2
,
5
+
(
−
4
)
2
)
=
(
1
2
,

2
)
( 
2
−4+5
​	
 , 
2
5+(−4)
​	
 )=( 
2
1
​	
 , 
2
1
​	
 )
which is not o(0,0). so, o is not the midpoint.

maybe the vectors have some relationship.

vector from a to o is (0 - (-4), 0 - 5) = (4, -5)

vector from o to b is (5 - 0, -4 - 0) = (5, -4)

are these vectors parallel? let's see if one is a scalar multiple of the other.

if (5, -4) = k*(4, -5), then:

5 = 4k and -4 = -5k

from first equation, k = 5/4

from second equation, k = 4/5

these are not equal, so vectors are not parallel.

so, the path from a to o to b is not a straight line.

therefore, the total distance is indeed 2√41.

but i recall that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, which is 9√2, and brenda is taking a longer path, which is 2√41, which is approximately the same but slightly longer, which makes sense.

alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that o is on the straight line path from a to b.

wait a minute, is o on the straight line from a to b?

let's check if o lies on the line segment between a and b.

to check if o is collinear with a and b, i can check if the area of the triangle formed by a, o, and b is zero.

the area of a triangle given three points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3) is:

area

since the area is not zero, o is not collinear with a and b, meaning that o is not on the straight line between a and b.

therefore, brenda has to make a detour, and her path is a to o to b, with total distance 2√41.

but wait, maybe there's a more efficient path that goes through o but is shorter than a straight line.

is there a way to minimize the total distance while passing through o?

well, in general, if you have to go from a to b passing through o, the minimal path is a to o to b, assuming o is not on the straight line between a and b.

which it isn't, as we've established.

therefore, the minimal distance brenda has to travel is indeed 2√41.

alternatively, if o is not necessarily the point where she has to stop, but just somewhere on her path, maybe she could choose a different point to minimize the distance.

but according to the problem, she needs to stop by the origin, which is o(0,0).

so, she has to go through o.

therefore, the minimal distance is a to o plus o to b, which is 2√41.

alternatively, perhaps there's a way to consider vectors or parametric equations to confirm this.

let me try parametric equations.

let’s parametrize the path from a to o to b.

first, from a(-4,5) to o(0,0), we can represent the path as:

x
=
−
4
+
4
t
x=−4+4t
y
=
5
−
5
t
y=5−5t
where t goes from 0 to 1.

then, from o(0,0) to b(5,-4):

x
=
0
+
5
s
x=0+5s
y
=
0
−
4
s
y=0−4s
where s goes from 0 to 1.

so, the total distance is the sum of the lengths of these two segments, which is 2√41, as calculated earlier.

alternatively, maybe there's a way to compute the distance using vector magnitudes.

vector a to o is (4, -5), and o to b is (5, -4).

the magnitude of each vector is √(16 + 25) = √41 and √(25 + 16) = √41, respectively.

therefore, total distance is 2√41.

alternatively, maybe i can consider the triangle formed by a, o, and b and see if there's any property i can use.

we already calculated the area and found it's 9/2, confirming that the points are not collinear.

alternatively, maybe i can use the law of cosines to relate the sides.

in triangle aob, we have sides ao = √41, bo = √41, and ab = 9√2.

interesting, so the angle at o is such that its cosine is -40/41.

but i'm not sure if this helps me find the total distance brenda has to travel. it seems like extra information.

alternatively, maybe i can consider the path a to o to b as two vectors and find their sum, but that doesn't directly give the distance traveled.

wait, perhaps i can think about the displacement from a to b, which is 9√2, but the actual path taken is longer because it's a to o to b.

so, perhaps the problem is just to confirm that the total distance is indeed 2√41, as calculated earlier.

alternatively, maybe i can consider reflecting points over axes or something to find a shorter path, but since o is fixed, that might not apply.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the path a to o to b as two legs of a right triangle, but in this case, since o is not the right angle, that might not help.

wait, actually, in triangle aob, we have ao = bo = √41 and ab = 9√2.

let me check if this satisfies the triangle inequality.

the sum of any two sides should be greater than the third side.

ao + bo = 2√41 ≈ 12.806

ab = 9√2 ≈ 12.728

so, 2√41 > 9√2, which holds.

similarly, ao + ab > bo and bo + ab > ao, which should also hold.

therefore, the triangle inequality is satisfied.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider minimizing the distance by choosing a different point to stop, but again, the problem specifies that brenda needs to stop at the origin.

therefore, the minimal distance is indeed 2√41.

alternatively, maybe i can consider the distance a to o plus o to b as the total distance, and that's the answer.

so, the answer is 2√41.

alternatively, perhaps i can rationalize it differently, but i don't see a simpler way.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the coordinates in polar form or something, but that might complicate things more.

alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that the minimal path is a to o to b.

wait, perhaps there is a shorter path that goes through o but isn't a straight line from a to o to b.

but in general, the minimal path that passes through o from a to b is a straight line from a to o plus a straight line from o to b.

unless there's some constraint i'm missing.

alternatively, perhaps brenda can take a curved path through o, but typically, minimal distance paths are straight lines between points.

therefore, i think the minimal distance is indeed 2√41.

alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an exact form, which is 2√41, or maybe a decimal approximation.

but since the problem is likely expecting an exact answer, i'll go with 2√41.

alternatively, maybe i can check the answer by comparing the distances.

we have ao = √41, bo = √41, and ab = 9√2.

as we saw, 2√41 ≈ 12.806 and 9√2 ≈ 12.728.

so, 2√41 is indeed slightly longer than the straight-line distance, which makes sense for a detour through o.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that o is the midpoint of a and b, but as we saw earlier, o is not the midpoint.

alternatively, perhaps there's a relationship between the coordinates that i can exploit.

looking at the coordinates:

a(-4,5), o(0,0), b(5,-4)

i notice that the coordinates are sort of "swapped" and negated in a way.

from a to o, x increases by 4 and y decreases by 5.

from o to b, x increases by 5 and y decreases by 4.

so, it's like the changes in x and y are swapped in magnitude.

but i don't know if that has any significance here.

alternatively, perhaps i can think about vectors.

vector from a to o is (4, -5), and from o to b is (5, -4).

the dot product of these vectors is (4)(5) + (-5)(-4) = 20 + 20 = 40.

the magnitudes are both √41.

so, the cosine of the angle between them is (40)/(√41 * √41) = 40/41.

which matches the earlier calculation where cos(theta) = -40/41 in the triangle, but i think i might have made a mistake there.

wait, earlier i used the law of cosines and got cos(theta) = -40/41, but here i'm getting cos(theta) = 40/41.

there might be a mistake in one of these calculations.

let me double-check the law of cosines part.

we had:

ab^2 = ao^2 + bo^2 - 2*ao*bo*cos(theta)

plugging in:

(9√2)^2 = (√41)^2 + (√41)^2 - 2*(√41)*(√41)*cos(theta)

81*2 = 41 + 41 - 82*cos(theta)

162 = 82 - 82*cos(theta)

162 - 82 = -82*cos(theta)

80 = -82*cos(theta)

cos(theta) = -80/82 = -40/41

but from the dot product, cos(theta) = (a ⋅ b)/(||a|| ||b||) = 40/(√41 * √41) = 40/41

wait, this is a contradiction.

one calculation says cos(theta) = -40/41, and the other says cos(theta) = 40/41.

this inconsistency suggests i made a mistake somewhere.

let me check the law of cosines again.

we have triangle aob, with ao = bo = √41, ab = 9√2.

law of cosines:

ab^2 = ao^2 + bo^2 - 2*ao*bo*cos(theta)

plugging in:

(9√2)^2 = (√41)^2 + (√41)^2 - 2*(√41)*(√41)*cos(theta)

81*2 = 41 + 41 - 82*cos(theta)

162 = 82 - 82*cos(theta)

162 - 82 = -82*cos(theta)

80 = -82*cos(theta)

cos(theta) = -80/82 = -40/41

but from the dot product:

cos(theta) = (ao ⋅ bo)/(||ao|| ||bo||)

first, vectors ao and bo.

vector ao is o - a = (0 - (-4), 0 - 5) = (4, -5)

vector bo is o - b = (0 - 5, 0 - (-4)) = (-5, 4)

wait, earlier i might have misdefined the vectors.

actually, vector ao is from a to o: (0 - (-4), 0 - 5) = (4, -5)

vector bo is from b to o: (0 - 5, 0 - (-4)) = (-5, 4)

therefore, ao ⋅ bo = (4)(-5) + (-5)(4) = -20 -20 = -40

||ao|| = √(16 + 25) = √41

||bo|| = √(25 + 16) = √41

therefore, cos(theta) = (-40)/(√41 * √41) = -40/41

which matches the earlier calculation from the law of cosines.

therefore, the angle at o is such that cos(theta) = -40/41.

previously, i mistakenly took bo as (5, -4), but it should be (-5,4), since it's from b to o.

therefore, the correct dot product is -40, and cos(theta) = -40/41.

so, no inconsistency there.

therefore, the earlier calculations are correct.

thus, the total distance brenda has to travel is indeed 2√41.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider if there's a way to make the path shorter by choosing a different route through o, but since o is fixed, and the straight lines from a to o and o to b are the shortest paths for those segments, the total distance is minimal at 2√41.

alternatively, perhaps the problem is testing the understanding of distance formula and path planning.

in that case, the answer is straightforward: calculate a to o and o to b distances and sum them.

therefore, the answer is 2√41.

alternatively, perhaps i can rationalize √41 in some way, but 41 is a prime number, so √41 cannot be simplified further.

therefore, the final answer is 2√41.

alternatively, if the problem expects a numerical approximation, 2*6.403 = 12.806, but it's likely expecting an exact form.

therefore, the answer is 2√41.

alternatively, perhaps i can check if there's a mistake in the initial assumption that brenda has to go from a to o to b, but the problem states she needs to stop by the origin on the way, so that's the path she must take.

alternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the coordinates, but assuming the coordinates are correct, the answer is 2√41.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider if brenda can go from a to o to b in a straight line, but since o is not on the straight line from a to b, she has to make a detour, and the minimal detour is a to o to b, which sums to 2√41.

therefore, the answer is 2√41.

alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of ab, but ab is 9√2, which is different from 2√41.

alternatively, perhaps the problem is testing the application of the distance formula in a multi-step path.

therefore, the answer is 2√41.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that brenda can take different paths through o, but the straight lines are the shortest, so 2√41 is indeed the minimal distance.

therefore, i conclude that brenda has to travel a total distance of 2√41 units.
