Answer: To find the smallest possible value of the expression \(6a^3 + 9b^3 + 32c^3 + \frac{1}{4abc}\) where \(a, b, c\) are positive real numbers, we can use calculus to find the critical points and verify the minimum value.

first, we define the function:
\[ f(a, b, c) = 6a^3 + 9b^3 + 32c^3 + \frac{1}{4abc} \]

we take the partial derivatives with respect to \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) and set them to zero to find the critical points:
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial a} = 18a^2 - \frac{1}{4a^2bc} = 0 \]
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial b} = 27b^2 - \frac{1}{4ab^2c} = 0 \]
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial c} = 96c^2 - \frac{1}{4abc^2} = 0 \]

solving these equations, we find:
\[ 72a^4bc = 1 \]
\[ 108ab^4c = 1 \]
\[ 384abc^4 = 1 \]

by setting these equal to each other and solving, we find:
\[ b = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{1/3} a \]
\[ c = \left(\frac{9}{32}\right)^{1/3} b \]

substituting back, we find:
\[ a = 6^{-1/3}, \quad b = 9^{-1/3}, \quad c = 32^{-1/3} \]

plugging these values back into the original expression:
\[ 6a^3 = 1, \quad 9b^3 = 1, \quad 32c^3 = 1 \]
\[ abc = 12^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{4abc} = 3 \]

thus, the expression evaluates to:
\[ 6a^3 + 9b^3 + 32c^3 + \frac{1}{4abc} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 6 \]

therefore, the smallest possible value of the expression is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
