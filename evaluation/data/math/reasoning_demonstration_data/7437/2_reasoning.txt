Reasoning: I've got this problem here: i need to find the smallest possible value of the expression 
6
a
3
+
9
b
3
+
32
c
3
+
1
4
a
b
c
6a 
3
 +9b 
3
 +32c 
3
 + 
4abc
1
​	
 , where 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c are positive real numbers. it looks like an optimization problem, probably involving calculus or maybe some inequality like am-gm. let me think about how to approach this.

first, since the expression has variables raised to different powers and there's a reciprocal term, it might be tricky to take partial derivatives directly. maybe i can consider using the am-gm inequality because it deals with sums and products of positive real numbers.

the am-gm inequality states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. in this case, i have four terms: 
6
a
3
6a 
3
 , 
9
b
3
9b 
3
 , 
32
c
3
32c 
3
 , and 
1
4
a
b
c
4abc
1
​	
 . if i can express them in a way that allows me to apply am-gm, that might help.

let me try to write the expression as a sum of terms that are all multiplied by constants:

6
a
3
+
9
b
3
+
32
c
3
+
1
4
a
b
c
6a 
3
 +9b 
3
 +32c 
3
 + 
4abc
1
​	
 

i wonder if i can group these terms in a way that their product becomes something manageable. alternatively, maybe i can consider each term separately and find a way to relate them.

another approach could be to use calculus and find the critical points by taking partial derivatives with respect to 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c, and setting them to zero. that might be a bit involved, but let's give it a shot.

let me define the function:

f
(
a
,
b
,
c
)
=
6
a
3
+
9
b
3
+
32
c
3
+
1
4
a
b
c
f(a,b,c)=6a 
3
 +9b 
3
 +32c 
3
 + 
4abc
1
​	
 

to find the minimum, i need to find where the partial derivatives are zero.

first, the partial derivative with respect to 
a
a:

∂
f
∂
a
=
18
a
2
−
1
4
a
2
b
c
∂a
∂f
​	
 =18a 
2
 − 
4a 
2
 bc
1
​	
 

set this equal to zero:

18
a
2
−
1
4
a
2
b
c
=
0
18a 
2
 − 
4a 
2
 bc
1
​	
 =0

similarly, the partial derivative with respect to 
b
b:

∂
f
∂
b
=
27
b
2
−
1
4
a
b
2
c
∂b
∂f
​	
 =27b 
2
 − 
4ab 
2
 c
1
​	
 

set this equal to zero:

27
b
2
−
1
4
a
b
2
c
=
0
27b 
2
 − 
4ab 
2
 c
1
​	
 =0

and the partial derivative with respect to 
c
c:

∂
f
∂
c
=
96
c
2
−
1
4
a
b
c
2
∂c
∂f
​	
 =96c 
2
 − 
4abc 
2
 
1
​	
 

set this equal to zero:

96
c
2
−
1
4
a
b
c
2
=
0
96c 
2
 − 
4abc 
2
 
1
​	
 =0

now i have three equations:

1. 
18
a
2
=
1
4
a
2
b
c
18a 
2
 = 
4a 
2
 bc
1
​	
 

2. 
27
b
2
=
1
4
a
b
2
c
27b 
2
 = 
4ab 
2
 c
1
​	
 

3. 
96
c
2
=
1
4
a
b
c
2
96c 
2
 = 
4abc 
2
 
1
​	
 

these look a bit messy. maybe i can solve them simultaneously.

let me solve the first equation for one variable in terms of the others.

from equation 1:

18
a
2
=
1
4
a
2
b
c
18a 
2
 = 
4a 
2
 bc
1
​	
 

multiply both sides by 
4
a
2
b
c
4a 
2
 bc:

18
a
2
⋅
4
a
2
b
c
=
1
18a 
2
 ⋅4a 
2
 bc=1

72
a
4
b
c
=
1
72a 
4
 bc=1

similarly, from equation 2:

27
b
2
=
1
4
a
b
2
c
27b 
2
 = 
4ab 
2
 c
1
​	
 

multiply both sides by 
4
a
b
2
c
4ab 
2
 c:

27
b
2
⋅
4
a
b
2
c
=
1
27b 
2
 ⋅4ab 
2
 c=1

108
a
b
4
c
=
1
108ab 
4
 c=1

and from equation 3:

96
c
2
=
1
4
a
b
c
2
96c 
2
 = 
4abc 
2
 
1
​	
 

multiply both sides by 
4
a
b
c
2
4abc 
2
 :

96
c
2
⋅
4
a
b
c
2
=
1
96c 
2
 ⋅4abc 
2
 =1

384
a
b
c
4
=
1
384abc 
4
 =1

now i have:

1. 
72
a
4
b
c
=
1
72a 
4
 bc=1

2. 
108
a
b
4
c
=
1
108ab 
4
 c=1

3. 
384
a
b
c
4
=
1
384abc 
4
 =1

since all equal to 1, i can set them equal to each other:

72
a
4
b
c
=
108
a
b
4
c
=
384
a
b
c
4
72a 
4
 bc=108ab 
4
 c=384abc 
4
 

let me first set the first two equal:

72
a
4
b
c
=
108
a
b
4
c
72a 
4
 bc=108ab 
4
 c

divide both sides by 
a
b
c
abc:

72
a
3
=
108
b
3
72a 
3
 =108b 
3
 

simplify:

72
a
3
=
108
b
3
72a 
3
 =108b 
3
 

divide both sides by 36:

2
a
3
=
3
b
3
2a 
3
 =3b 
3
 

so, 
b
3
=
2
3
a
3
b 
3
 = 
3
2
​	
 a 
3
 , which means 
b
=
(
2
3
)
1
/
3
a
b=( 
3
2
​	
 ) 
1/3
 a

similarly, set the second and third equal:

108
a
b
4
c
=
384
a
b
c
4
108ab 
4
 c=384abc 
4
 

divide both sides by 
a
b
c
abc:

108
b
3
=
384
c
3
108b 
3
 =384c 
3
 

simplify:

108
b
3
=
384
c
3
108b 
3
 =384c 
3
 

divide both sides by 12:

9
b
3
=
32
c
3
9b 
3
 =32c 
3
 

so, 
c
3
=
9
32
b
3
c 
3
 = 
32
9
​	
 b 
3
 , which means 
c
=
(
9
32
)
1
/
3
b
c=( 
32
9
​	
 ) 
1/3
 b

now, from earlier, 
b
=
(
2
3
)
1
/
3
a
b=( 
3
2
​	
 ) 
1/3
 a, so substituting into the expression for 
c
c:

c
=
(
9
32
)
1
/
3
(
2
3
)
1
/
3
a
=
(
9
32
⋅
2
3
)
1
/
3
a
=
(
18
96
)
1
/
3
a
=
(
3

)
1
/
3
a
c=( 
32

​	
 ) 
1/3
 (

1/3
 a=(

 a=( 
96
18
​	
 ) 
1/3
 a=(

​	
 ) 
1/3
 a

now i have 
b
b and 
c
c in terms of 
a
a. let's substitute these back into one of the original equations to solve for 
a
a.

let's use the first equation:

72

substitute

so,

now, i need to plug these back into the original expression to find its value.

original expression:

let's compute each term:

first, 
6
a

 :

a

=

=

6
a 
3
 =(6

 =6

 =

so,

=

 =6⋅

second,

=

b

so,

 =32⋅

fourth,

a

​	
 :

first, find 
a

a
=

−

a=6

3
b=9 
−1/3
 , 
c
=

−

/

c=32

so,

3
abc=6 
−1/3
 ⋅9

 ⋅32 
−1/3
 =(6⋅9⋅32) 
−1/3
 

compute 
6
⋅
9
=
54
6⋅9=54, 
54
⋅
32
=
1728
54⋅32=1728

so, 
a
b
c
=
172

−
1
/
3
abc=1728 
−1/3
 

but 
1728
=

3
1728=12

 , so 
172

−
1
=
1
12
1728 
−1/3
 =12 
−1
 =

​	
 

therefore, 
1
4
a
b
c
=
1
4
⋅
1
12
=
1
1
3
=
3

​	
 = 
4⋅ 
12
1
​	
 
1
​	
 = 
3
1
​	
 
1
​	
 =3

now, add up all the terms:

6
a
3
+
9
b
3
+
32
c
3
+
1
4
a
b
c
=
1
+
1
+
1
+
3
=
6
6a 
3
 +9b 
3
 +32c 
3
 + 
4abc
1
​	
 =1+1+1+3=6

so, the minimal value is 6.

wait a minute, but the problem is to find the smallest possible value of that expression. is 6 indeed the smallest possible value? maybe i should check if there's a lower value possible.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the am-gm inequality directly on the four terms.

recall that am-gm for four positive real numbers 
x
,
y
,
z
,
w
x,y,z,w is:

x
+
y
+
z
+
w
4
≥
x
y
z
w
4
4
x+y+z+w
​	
 ≥ 
4
  
xyzw
​	
 

equality holds when 
x
=
y
=
z
=
w
x=y=z=w.

so, if i set 
x
=
6
a
3
x=6a 
3
 , 
y
=
9
b
3
y=9b 
3
 , 
z
=
32
c
3
z=32c 
3
 , and 
w
=
1
4
a
b
c
w= 
4abc
1
​	
 , then:

6
a
3
+
9
b
3
+
32
c
3
+
1
4
a
b
c
4
≥

⋅

hmm, this seems a bit complicated. maybe there's a better way to apply am-gm here.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider weighted am-gm, where the weights correspond to the coefficients in the expression.

let me consider the exponents of 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c in each term:

- in 
6
a
3
6a 
3
 , the exponent of 
a
a is 3, and 
b
b and 
c
c are 0.

- in 
9
b
3
9b 
3
 , the exponent of 
b
b is 3, and 
a
a and 
c
c are 0.

- in 
32
c
3
32c 
3
 , the exponent of 
c
c is 3, and 
a
a and 
b
b are 0.

- in 
1
4
a
b
c
4abc
1
​	
 , the exponents are 
a
−
1
a 
−1
 , 
b
−
1
b 
−1
 , 
c
−
1
c 
−1
 .

this mixed exponents make it tricky to apply am-gm directly. maybe another inequality would be more appropriate.

let me consider using the method of lagrange multipliers, but that might be overkill for this problem.

alternatively, perhaps i can make a substitution to simplify the expression. for example, let me set 
x
=
a
3
x=a 
3
 , 
y
=
b
3
y=b 
3
 , and 
z
=
c
3
z=c 
3
 . then, the expression becomes:

6
x
+
9
y
+
32
z
+
1
4
(
x
1
/
3
y
1
/
3
z
1
/
3
)
6x+9y+32z+ 
4(x 
1/3
 y 
1/3
 z 
1/3
 )
1
​	
 

this still seems complicated.

wait, maybe i can consider the exponents in a way that allows me to set the derivatives equal.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the am-gm inequality on the first three terms and handle the reciprocal separately.

let me try that.

first, consider 
6
a
3
+
9
b
3
+
32
c
3
6a 
3
 +9b 
3
 +32c 
3
 . if i can find the minimum of this part and then add the 
1
4
a
b
c
4abc
1
​	
  term, but that doesn't seem straightforward.

alternatively, maybe i can group the terms differently.

wait, perhaps i can think of the expression as the sum of four terms and try to balance them using am-gm.

let me consider that the minimal value occurs when all four terms are equal, based on am-gm equality condition.

so, set 
6
a
3
=
9
b
3
=
32
c
3
=
1
4
a
b
c
=
k
6a 
3
 =9b 
3
 =32c 
3
 = 
4abc
1
​	
 =k, for some constant 
k
k.

then, i can solve for 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c in terms of 
k
k.

from 
6
a
3
=
k
6a 
3
 =k, we get 
a
=
(
k
6
)
1
/
3
a=( 
6
k
​	
 ) 
1/3
 

from 
9
b
3
=
k
9b 
3
 =k, we get 
b
=
(
k

)
1
/
3
b=( 
9
k
​	
 ) 
1/3
 

from 
32
c
3
=
k
32c 
3
 =k, we get 
c
=
(
k
32
)
1
/
3
c=(

​	
 )

and from

a

4abc
1
​	
 =k, we have 
a
b
c
=

4
k
abc=

​	
 

now, substitute 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c in terms of 
k
k into the expression for 
a
b
c
abc:

(
k

​	
 ) 
1/3
 ⋅(

​

 =

​	
 

simplify the left side:

 ) 
1/3
 =( 
1728
k 
3
 
​	
 )

 =

​	
 

so, 
k
12
=
1
4
k
12
k
​	
 = 
4k
1
​	
 

multiply both sides by 
12
k
12k:

k
2
=
3
k 
2
 =3

thus, 
k
=
3
k= 
3
​	
  (since 
k
k is positive)

now, the original expression is 
6

​	
 =4k=4

​	
 

wait, but earlier when i used calculus, i got the minimal value as 6, and now using am-gm, i'm getting 
4
3
4 
3
​	
 , which is approximately 6.928, which is larger than 6. that doesn't make sense; the minimal value should be the same regardless of the method used.

i must have made a mistake somewhere. let me check my steps.

in the am-gm approach, i set 
6
a
3
=
9
b
3
=
32
c
3
=
1
4
a
b
c
=
k
6a 
3
 =9b 
3
 =32c 
3
 = 
4abc
1
​	
 =k, and then i found that 
k
=
3
k= 
3
​	
 , leading to the expression equal to 
4
k
=
4
3
4k=4 
3
​	
 . but earlier, using calculus, i found the minimal value to be 6. there's a discrepancy here.

let me verify the assumption that the minimal value occurs when all four terms are equal. in am-gm, equality holds when all the terms are equal, but in this case, the terms have different coefficients, so maybe that's not the correct approach.

alternatively, perhaps i need to use weighted am-gm, where the weights correspond to the coefficients in the expression.

let me consider that.

suppose i assign weights to each term proportional to their coefficients. for example, the weights could be 
6
6, 
9
9, 
32
32, and some weight for the last term.

but this seems complicated. maybe there's a better way.

let me go back to the calculus approach. i found that 
a
=
6
−
1
/
3
a=6 
−1/3
 , 
b
=
9
−
1
/
3
b=9 
−1/3
 , and 
c
=
3
2
−
1
/
3
c=32 
−1/3
 , and plugging these back into the expression gave me 6. maybe that's the correct minimal value.

alternatively, perhaps the am-gm approach needs to be adjusted. maybe i should consider the exponents in a different way.

let me try applying am-gm to the terms 
6
a
3
6a 
3
 , 
9
b
3
9b 
3
 , 
32
c
3
32c 
3
 , and 
1
4
a
b
c
4abc
1
​	
 , but weighted appropriately.

suppose i consider the expression as a sum of four terms, each raised to a certain power, and try to minimize their sum.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the method of substitution to reduce the number of variables.

for instance, express 
b
b in terms of 
a
a, and 
c
c in terms of 
a
a, as i did earlier, and then express the entire function in terms of a single variable 
a
a, and then find its minimum.

wait, i already did that earlier using calculus and found the minimal value to be 6.

alternatively, maybe i can consider the expression 
6
a
3
+
9
b
3
+
32
c
3
+
1
4
a
b
c
6a 
3
 +9b 
3
 +32c 
3
 + 
4abc
1
​	
  and try to find a lower bound using am-gm.

let me consider the terms 
6
a
3
6a 
3
 , 
9
b
3
9b 
3
 , 
32
c
3
32c 
3
 , and 
1
4
a
b
c

​	
 .

if i set 
x
=
6
a
3
x=6a 
3
 , 
y
=
9
b
3
y=9b 
3
 , 
z
=

3
z=32c 
3
 , and 
w
=
1
4
a
b
c
w=

​	
 , then by am-gm:

this still seems complicated. maybe there's another way to approach this.

let me consider that in optimization problems with positive variables, sometimes setting the derivatives equal can lead to a system of equations that can be solved for the variables.

alternatively, perhaps i can use substitution to reduce the number of variables.

given that 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c are positive real numbers, maybe i can set 
a
=
k
x
a=kx, 
b
=
m
x
b=mx, and 
c
=
n
x
c=nx, where 
k
k, 
m
m, and 
n
n are constants to be determined.

but this might not necessarily simplify the problem.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider minimizing the expression by fixing two variables and optimizing the third, but that might be time-consuming.

given that the calculus approach led me to a minimal value of 6, and the am-gm approach suggested 
4
3
4 
3
​	
 , which is larger, i think the calculus approach is more accurate in this case.

perhaps the am-gm approach doesn't directly apply here because of the different exponents and the reciprocal term.

therefore, i'll stick with the calculus approach and conclude that the minimal value is 6.

alternatively, maybe there's a way to confirm that 6 is indeed the minimal value.

let me plug in the values i found for 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c back into the original expression to verify.

given:

adding them up: 
1

+
3
=
6
1+1+1+3=6

so, the expression equals 6 at these values of 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c.

to ensure that this is indeed the minimum, i can consider small perturbations around these values and see if the expression increases.

for example, let me choose 
a
=
6
−
1
/
3
+
ϵ
a=6 
−1/3
 +ϵ, where 
ϵ
ϵ is a small positive number, and keep 
b
b and 
c
c as before.

then, 
6
a
3
6a 
3
  will increase because 
a
a is increasing, and since the other terms are dependent on 
a
a, the overall expression will likely increase.

similarly, decreasing 
a
a below 
6
−
1
/
3
6 
−1/3
  will cause 
6
a
3
6a 
3
  to decrease, but 
a
b
c
abc will decrease, making 
1
4
a
b
c
4abc
1
​	
  increase, possibly leading to an overall increase in the expression.

therefore, it seems that 6 is indeed the minimal value of the expression.

alternatively, perhaps there's a more elegant way to see that 6 is the minimal value without going through calculus.

let me consider the expression again:

6
a
3
+
9
b
3
+
32
c
3
+
1
4
a
b
c
6a 
3
 +9b 
3
 +32c 
3
 + 
4abc
1
​	
 

notice that the coefficients 6, 9, and 32 are multiples of 3, and 32 is a multiple of 8.

perhaps there's a way to group these terms or factor them in a way that reveals the minimal value.

alternatively, maybe i can consider the expression in terms of the product 
a
b
c
abc, but that seems complicated.

given the time i've spent on this, and the consistency between the calculus approach and the verification, i'm going to conclude that the smallest possible value of the expression is 6.
