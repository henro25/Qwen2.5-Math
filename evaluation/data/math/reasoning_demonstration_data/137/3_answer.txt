Answer: Given that the volume of a cylinder is \( 54\pi \) cmÂ³, we need to find the volume of a cone with the same radius and height as the cylinder, expressed in terms of \( \pi \).

first, recall the formulas for the volumes of a cylinder and a cone:
\[
v_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
\[
v_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
\]

since the cylinder and the cone have the same radius and height, the volume of the cone is one-third the volume of the cylinder. therefore, we can calculate the volume of the cone as follows:
\[
v_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} v_{\text{cylinder}}
\]
\[
v_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \times 54\pi
\]
\[
v_{\text{cone}} = 18\pi \, \text{cm}^3
\]

thus, the volume of the cone is:
\[
\boxed{18\pi}
\]
