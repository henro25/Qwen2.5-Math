Reasoning: 
So i need to solve the equation 
⌊
x
⌊
x
⌋
⌋
=
29
⌊x⌊x⌋⌋=29, where 
⌊
⋅
⌋
⌊⋅⌋ denotes the floor function, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to the given number.

first, i need to understand what this equation is saying. the floor of 
x
x times the floor of 
x
x equals 29. so, i need to find all real numbers 
x
x such that when i multiply 
x
x by its floor, and then take the floor of that product, i get 29.

let me denote 
⌊
x
⌋
⌊x⌋ as 
n
n, where 
n
n is an integer. so, 
n
≤
x
<
n
+
1
n≤x<n+1. then, the equation becomes 
⌊
x
⋅
n
⌋
=
29
⌊x⋅n⌋=29.

this means that 
29
≤
x
⋅
n
<
30
29≤x⋅n<30.

since 
n
n is the floor of 
x
x, and 
n
n is an integer, i can consider different integer values of 
n
n and solve for 
x
x in each case.

so, i need to find integers 
n
n such that there exists an 
x
x in 
[
n
,
n
+
1
)
[n,n+1) with 
29
≤
x
⋅
n
<
30
29≤x⋅n<30.

let me consider possible integer values for 
n
n.

first, let's consider 
n
=
5
n=5. then, 
x
x is in 
[
5
,
6
)
[5,6). so, 
x
⋅
5
x⋅5 is in 
[
25
,
30
)
[25,30). but i need 
x
⋅
5
x⋅5 to be at least 29, so 
x
≥
29
/
5
=
5.8
x≥29/5=5.8. therefore, 
x
x is in 
[
5.8
,
6
)
[5.8,6). so, in this case, 
x
x is between 5.8 and 6.

but let's check if this works. if 
x
=
5.8
x=5.8, then 
⌊
x
⌋
=
5
⌊x⌋=5, and 
x
⋅
⌊
x
⌋
=
5.8
×
5
=
29
x⋅⌊x⌋=5.8×5=29, and 
⌊
29
⌋
=
29
⌊29⌋=29, which satisfies the equation.

if 
x
=
5.9
x=5.9, then 
⌊
x
⌋
=
5
⌊x⌋=5, and 
x
⋅
⌊
x
⌋
=
5.9
×
5
=
29.5
x⋅⌊x⌋=5.9×5=29.5, and 
⌊
29.5
⌋
=
29
⌊29.5⌋=29, which also satisfies the equation.

similarly, 
x
=
5.99
x=5.99 gives 
5.99
×
5
=
29.95
5.99×5=29.95, and 
⌊
29.95
⌋
=
29
⌊29.95⌋=29, still satisfying the equation.

but what about 
x
=
6
x=6? wait, 
x
x is in 
[
5
,
6
)
[5,6), so 
x
x cannot be 6. so, for 
n
=
5
n=5, 
x
x is in 
[
5.8
,
6
)
[5.8,6).

now, let's consider 
n
=
6
n=6. then, 
x
x is in 
[
6
,
7
)
[6,7), and 
x
⋅
6
x⋅6 is in 
[
36
,
42
)
[36,42). but 36 is already greater than 29, and the lower bound is 36, which is greater than 29, but we need 
x
⋅
6
x⋅6 to be at least 29 and less than 30. however, since 
x
⋅
6
≥
36
x⋅6≥36, which is greater than 30, there is no solution in this case.

next, 
n
=
4
n=4. then, 
x
x is in 
[
4
,
5
)
[4,5), and 
x
⋅
4
x⋅4 is in 
[
16
,
20
)
[16,20). but 16 is less than 29, and 20 is less than 29, so no solution here.

similarly, for 
n
=
3
n=3, 
x
x is in 
[
3
,
4
)
[3,4), 
x
⋅
3
x⋅3 is in 
[
9
,
12
)
[9,12), which is less than 29.

for 
n
=
2
n=2, 
x
x is in 
[
2
,
3
)
[2,3), 
x
⋅
2
x⋅2 is in 
[
4
,
6
)
[4,6), still less than 29.

for 
n
=
1
n=1, 
x
x is in 
[
1
,
2
)
[1,2), 
x
⋅
1
x⋅1 is in 
[
1
,
2
)
[1,2), less than 29.

for 
n
=
0
n=0, 
x
x is in 
[
0
,
1
)
[0,1), 
x
⋅
0
=
0
x⋅0=0, which doesn't satisfy the equation.

for 
n
=
−
1
n=−1, 
x
x is in 
[
−
1
,
0
)
[−1,0), 
x
⋅
(
−
1
)
x⋅(−1) is in 
(
0
,
1
]
(0,1], which is positive, but less than 1, so 
⌊
x
⋅
(
−
1
)
⌋
=
0
⌊x⋅(−1)⌋=0, which doesn't satisfy the equation.

for 
n
=
−
2
n=−2, 
x
x is in 
[
−
2
,
−
1
)
[−2,−1), 
x
⋅
(
−
2
)
x⋅(−2) is in 
(
2
,
4
]
(2,4], which is greater than or equal to 2, but less than 4, which is still less than 29.

similarly, for 
n
=
−
3
n=−3, 
x
x is in 
[
−
3
,
−
2
)
[−3,−2), 
x
⋅
(
−
3
)
x⋅(−3) is in 
(
6
,
9
]
(6,9], still less than 29.

continuing this way, for negative 
n
n, 
x
⋅
n
x⋅n increases in magnitude but remains less than 29. so, no solutions there.

therefore, the only possible integer 
n
n is 5, and for that, 
x
x is in 
[
5.8
,
6
)
[5.8,6).

wait a minute, but what about 
n
=
5
n=5 and 
x
x less than 5.8? for example, 
x
=
5.8
x=5.8, as i did before, that works, but what about 
x
=
5.7
x=5.7? let's check.

if 
x
=
5.7
x=5.7, then 
⌊
x
⌋
=
5
⌊x⌋=5, and 
x
⋅
5
=
28.5
x⋅5=28.5, and 
⌊
28.5
⌋
=
28
⌊28.5⌋=28, which is less than 29, so it doesn't satisfy the equation.

so, 
x
x needs to be at least 5.8 to make 
x
⋅
5
≥
29
x⋅5≥29, and less than 6 to keep 
x
<
6
x<6, hence 
x
∈
[
5.8
,
6
)
x∈[5.8,6).

wait, but let me confirm the upper bound. for 
x
<
6
x<6, 
x
⋅
5
<
30
x⋅5<30, since 
5
×
6
=
30
5×6=30, but 
x
<
6
x<6, so 
x
⋅
5
<
30
x⋅5<30, which satisfies the upper bound of 
x
⋅
n
<
30
x⋅n<30.

therefore, the solution set is 
x
∈
[
5.8
,
6
)
x∈[5.8,6).

but i should also consider if there are any other integer values of 
n
n that could satisfy the equation.

wait, what if 
n
n is not an integer? no, 
n
n is defined as 
⌊
x
⌋
⌊x⌋, which is always an integer.

therefore, the only possible integer 
n
n is 5, and the corresponding 
x
x is in 
[
5.8
,
6
)
[5.8,6).

but just to be thorough, let me consider if 
n
n could be a non-integer, but no, because floor of 
x
x is always an integer.

therefore, the final answer is 
x
∈
[
5.8
,
6
)
x∈[5.8,6).

but maybe i should express it in terms of inequalities.

so, 
5.8
≤
x
<
6
5.8≤x<6.

alternatively, 
x
∈
[
29
/
5
,
6
)
x∈[29/5,6), since 
29
/
5
=
5.8
29/5=5.8.

yes, that seems correct.

let me just check another value, say 
x
=
5.8
x=5.8:

⌊
5.8
⌋
=
5
⌊5.8⌋=5, 
5.8
×
5
=
29
5.8×5=29, 
⌊
29
⌋
=
29
⌊29⌋=29, which matches.

and 
x
=
5.9
x=5.9:

⌊
5.9
⌋
=
5
⌊5.9⌋=5, 
5.9
×
5
=
29.5
5.9×5=29.5, 
⌊
29.5
⌋
=
29
⌊29.5⌋=29, also matches.

and 
x
=
5.999
x=5.999:

⌊
5.999
⌋
=
5
⌊5.999⌋=5, 
5.999
×
5
=
29.995
5.999×5=29.995, 
⌊
29.995
⌋
=
29
⌊29.995⌋=29, still matches.

at 
x
=
6
x=6, 
⌊
6
⌋
=
6
⌊6⌋=6, 
6
×
6
=
36
6×6=36, 
⌊
36
⌋
=
36
⌊36⌋=36, which is greater than 29, so 
x
x cannot be 6.

therefore, the solution is indeed 
5.8
≤
x
<
6
5.8≤x<6.

**final answer**

5.8
≤
x
<
6
5.8≤x<6
