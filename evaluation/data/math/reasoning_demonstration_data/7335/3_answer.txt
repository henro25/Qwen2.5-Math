Answer: 1. **Identify the known values:**
   - Total number of people taking either English or French: 25.
   - Number of people taking both English and French: 2.
   - The number of people in the English class is twice the number in the French class.

2. **Define variables:**
   - Let \( F \) represent the number of people taking French.
   - Then, the number of people taking English is \( E = 2F \).

3. **Set up the equation for total students:**
   \[
   E + F - \text{Both} = 25
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   2F + F - 2 = 25
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   3F - 2 = 25
   \]
   \[
   3F = 27
   \]
   \[
   F = 9
   \]
   Therefore, \( E = 2F = 18 \).

4. **Find the number of people taking only English:**
   \[
   \text{English only} = E - \text{Both} = 18 - 2 = 16
   \]

**Answer:** 16 people are taking English but not French.
