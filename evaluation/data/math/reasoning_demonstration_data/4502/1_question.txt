Problem: Two circles have the same center $C.$ (Circles which have the same center are called concentric.) The larger circle has radius $10$ and the smaller circle has radius $6.$ Determine the area of the ring between these two circles. [asy]
import graph;
filldraw(circle((0,0),10), lightgray, black+linewidth(1));
filldraw(circle((0,0),6), white, black+linewidth(1));
dot((0,0));
label("$C$",(0,0),NE);
