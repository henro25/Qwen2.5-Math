Problem: Rachel has two identical basil plants and an aloe plant. She also has two identical white lamps and two identical red lamps she can put each plant under (she can put more than one plant under a lamp, but each plant is under exactly one lamp). How many ways are there for Rachel to put her plants under her lamps?
