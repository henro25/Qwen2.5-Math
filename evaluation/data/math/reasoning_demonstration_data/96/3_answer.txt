Answer: First, we find the area of triangle \(abc\) using the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices:

\[
\text{area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_a(y_b - y_c) + x_b(y_c - y_a) + x_c(y_a - y_b) \right|
\]

plugging in the coordinates \(a(0,8)\), \(b(2,0)\), and \(c(8,0)\):

\[
\text{area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0(0 - 0) + 2(0 - 8) + 8(8 - 0) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 - 16 + 64 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
\]

we need a line through \(b\) that cuts the area of the triangle in half, i.e., 12 square units. we consider the line through \(b\) intersecting \(ac\) at some point \(d(x, y)\).

the equation of line \(ac\) is found using the points \(a(0,8)\) and \(c(8,0)\):

\[
\text{slope of } ac = \frac{0 - 8}{8 - 0} = -1 \quad \text{and} \quad \text{equation: } y = -x + 8
\]

any point \(d\) on \(ac\) is of the form \((x, -x + 8)\). we use the area formula for triangle \(abd\):

\[
\text{area of } \triangle abd = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_a(y_b - y_d) + x_b(y_d - y_a) + x_d(y_a - y_b) \right|
\]

plugging in \(a(0,8)\), \(b(2,0)\), and \(d(x, -x + 8)\):

\[
\text{area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0(0 - (-x + 8)) + 2((-x + 8) - 8) + x(8 - 0) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 + 2(-x) + 8x \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 6x \right| = 3|x|
\]

setting the area equal to 12:

\[
3|x| = 12 \implies |x| = 4 \implies x = 4 \quad (\text{since } x \text{ is between 0 and 8})
\]

thus, \(d\) is at \((4, 4)\). the line through \(b(2,0)\) and \(d(4,4)\) has a slope:

\[
\text{slope} = \frac{4 - 0}{4 - 2} = 2
\]

the equation of the line is:

\[
y - 0 = 2(x - 2) \implies y = 2x - 4
\]

the sum of the slope and the y-intercept is:

\[
2 + (-4) = -2
\]

therefore, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{-2}
\]
