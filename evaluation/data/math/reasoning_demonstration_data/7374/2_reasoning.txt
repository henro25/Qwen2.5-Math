Reasoning: So i have this problem here. it says:

let 
x
x and 
y
y be real numbers such that

4
x
2
+
8
x
y
+
5
y
2
=
1.
4x 
2
 +8xy+5y 
2
 =1.
let 
m
m and 
m
m be the minimum and maximum values of

2
x
2
+
3
x
y
+
2
y
2
,
2x 
2
 +3xy+2y 
2
 ,
respectively. find the product 
m
⋅
m
m⋅m.

okay, first off, i need to find the minimum and maximum values of one quadratic form given that another quadratic form is equal to 1. this seems like an optimization problem with a constraint.

i remember that quadratic forms can be represented using matrices. maybe i can use that to approach this problem.

let me recall that a quadratic form 
q
(
x
,
y
)
=
a
x
2
+
b
x
y
+
c
y
2
q(x,y)=ax 
2
 +bxy+cy 
2
  can be written in matrix form as:

q
(
x
,
y
)
=
(
x
y
 
)
(
a
b
/
2
b
/
2
c
 
)
(
x
y
 
)
.
q(x,y)=( 
x
​	
  
y
​	
 )( 
a
b/2
​	
  
b/2
c
​	
 )( 
x
y
​	
 ).
so, for the constraint equation:

4
x
2
+
8
x
y
+
5
y
2
=
1
,
4x 
2
 +8xy+5y 
2
 =1,
the corresponding matrix is:

a
=
(
4
4
4
5
 
)
.
a=( 
4
4
​	
  
4
5
​	
 ).
and for the function to optimize:

2
x
2
+
3
x
y
+
2
y
2
,
2x 
2
 +3xy+2y 
2
 ,
the matrix is:

b
=
(
2
1.5
1.5
2
 
)
.
b=( 
2
1.5
​	
  
1.5
2
​	
 ).
now, i think this is related to eigenvalues. specifically, i believe that the extrema of one quadratic form subject to another quadratic form being constant are related to the generalized eigenvalues of the matrices involved.

so, perhaps i need to find the eigenvalues 
λ
λ such that:

det
⁡
(
b
−
λ
a
)
=
0.
det(b−λa)=0.
let me set that up:

det
⁡
(
(
2
1.5
1.5
2
 
)
−
λ
(
4
4
4
5
 
)
)
=
0.
det(( 
2
1.5
​	
  
1.5
2
​	
 )−λ( 
4
4
​	
  
4
5
​	
 ))=0.
calculating the matrix inside the determinant:

(
2
−
4
λ
1.5
−
4
λ
1.5
−
4
λ
2
−
5
λ
 
)
.
( 
2−4λ
1.5−4λ
​	
  
1.5−4λ
2−5λ
​	
 ).
now, the determinant is:

(
2
−
4
λ
)
(
2
−
5
λ
)
−
(
1.5
−
4
λ
)
2
=
0.
(2−4λ)(2−5λ)−(1.5−4λ) 
2
 =0.
let me expand this:

first, expand 
(
2
−
4
λ
)
(
2
−
5
λ
)
(2−4λ)(2−5λ):

2
⋅
2
=
4
,
2⋅2=4,
2
⋅
(
−
5
λ
)
=
−
10
λ
,
2⋅(−5λ)=−10λ,
−
4
λ
⋅
2
=
−
8
λ
,
−4λ⋅2=−8λ,
−
4
λ
⋅
(
−
5
λ
)
=
20
λ
2
.
−4λ⋅(−5λ)=20λ 
2
 .
so, 
(
2
−
4
λ
)
(
2
−
5
λ
)
=
4
−
18
λ
+
20
λ
2
(2−4λ)(2−5λ)=4−18λ+20λ 
2
 .

now, expand 
(
1.5
−
4
λ
)
2
(1.5−4λ) 
2
 :

(
1.5
)
2
=
2.25
,
(1.5) 
2
 =2.25,
2
⋅
1.5
⋅
(
−
4
λ
)
=
−
12
λ
,
2⋅1.5⋅(−4λ)=−12λ,
(
−
4
λ
)
2
=
16
λ
2
.
(−4λ) 
2
 =16λ 
2
 .
so, 
(
1.5
−
4
λ
)
2
=
2.25
−
12
λ
+
16
λ
2
(1.5−4λ) 
2
 =2.25−12λ+16λ 
2
 .

now, subtract the second expression from the first:

(
4
−
18
λ
+
20
λ
2
)
−
(
2.25
−
12
λ
+
16
λ
2
)
=
0.
(4−18λ+20λ 
2
 )−(2.25−12λ+16λ 
2
 )=0.
simplify:

4
−
18
λ
+
20
λ
2
−
2.25
+
12
λ
−
16
λ
2
=
0
,
4−18λ+20λ 
2
 −2.25+12λ−16λ 
2
 =0,
which simplifies to:

(
20
λ
2
−
16
λ
2
)
+
(
−
18
λ
+
12
λ
)
+
(
4
−
2.25
)
=
0
,
(20λ 
2
 −16λ 
2
 )+(−18λ+12λ)+(4−2.25)=0,
so:

4
λ
2
−
6
λ
+
1.75
=
0.
4λ 
2
 −6λ+1.75=0.
hmm, i can write 1.75 as 
7
4
4
7
​	
 , so:

4
λ
2
−
6
λ
+
7
4
=
0.
4λ 
2
 −6λ+ 
4
7
​	
 =0.
multiply through by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

16
λ
2
−
24
λ
+
7
=
0.
16λ 
2
 −24λ+7=0.
now, solve this quadratic equation for 
λ
λ. using the quadratic formula:

λ
=
24
±
(
−
24
)
2
−
4
⋅
16
⋅
7
2
⋅
16
=
24
±
576
−
448
32
=
24
±
128
32
.
λ= 
2⋅16
24± 
(−24) 
2
 −4⋅16⋅7
​	
 
​	
 = 
32
24± 
576−448
​	
 
​	
 = 
32
24± 
128
​	
 
​	
 .
simplify 
128
=
64
⋅
2
=
8
2
128
​	
 = 
64⋅2
​	
 =8 
2
​	
 , so:

λ
=
24
±
8
2
32
=
24
32
±
8
2
32
=
3
4
±
2
4
.
λ= 
32
24±8 
2
​	
 
​	
 = 
32
24
​	
 ± 
32
8 
2
​	
 
​	
 = 
4
3
​	
 ± 
4
2
​	
 
​	
 .
so, the eigenvalues are:

λ
1
=
3
+
2
4
,
λ
2
=
3
−
2
4
.
λ 
1
​	
 = 
4
3+ 
2
​	
 
​	
 ,λ 
2
​	
 = 
4
3− 
2
​	
 
​	
 .
now, i believe that these eigenvalues correspond to the extrema of the quadratic form 
2
x
2
+
3
x
y
+
2
y
2
2x 
2
 +3xy+2y 
2
  subject to the constraint 
4
x
2
+
8
x
y
+
5
y
2
=
1
4x 
2
 +8xy+5y 
2
 =1. specifically, the minimum value 
m
m should be 
λ
min
λ 
min
​	
  and the maximum value 
m
m should be 
λ
max
λ 
max
​	
 .

therefore, 
m
=
λ
2
=
3
−
2
4
m=λ 
2
​	
 = 
4
3− 
2
​	
 
​	
  and 
m
=
λ
1
=
3
+
2
4
m=λ 
1
​	
 = 
4
3+ 
2
​	
 
​	
 .

now, to find the product 
m
⋅
m
m⋅m, i can multiply these two expressions:

m
⋅
m
=
(
3
−
2
4
)
(
3
+
2
4
)
=
(
3
−
2
)
(
3
+
2
)
16
.
m⋅m=( 
4
3− 
2
​	
 
​	
 )( 
4
3+ 
2
​	
 
​	
 )= 
16
(3− 
2
​	
 )(3+ 
2
​	
 )
​	
 .
i recognize that 
(
a
−
b
)
(
a
+
b
)
=
a
2
−
b
2
(a−b)(a+b)=a 
2
 −b 
2
 , so:

(
3
−
2
)
(
3
+
2
)
=
9
−
2
=
7.
(3− 
2
​	
 )(3+ 
2
​	
 )=9−2=7.
therefore:

m
⋅
m
=
7
16
.
m⋅m= 
16
7
​	
 .
so, the product of the minimum and maximum values is 
7
16
16
7
​	
 .

i should probably check if this makes sense. maybe i can try another approach to confirm.

another way to approach this could be to use lagrange multipliers, setting up the function to optimize with the constraint.

let me set up the lagrangian:

l
=
2
x
2
+
3
x
y
+
2
y
2
−
λ
(
4
x
2
+
8
x
y
+
5
y
2
−
1
)
.
l=2x 
2
 +3xy+2y 
2
 −λ(4x 
2
 +8xy+5y 
2
 −1).
taking partial derivatives and setting them to zero:

∂
l
∂
x
=
4
x
+
3
y
−
λ
(
8
x
+
8
y
)
=
0
,
∂x
∂l
​	
 =4x+3y−λ(8x+8y)=0,
∂
l
∂
y
=
3
x
+
4
y
−
λ
(
8
x
+
10
y
)
=
0
,
∂y
∂l
​	
 =3x+4y−λ(8x+10y)=0,
∂
l
∂
λ
=
−
(
4
x
2
+
8
x
y
+
5
y
2
−
1
)
=
0.
∂λ
∂l
​	
 =−(4x 
2
 +8xy+5y 
2
 −1)=0.
so, i have the system:

4
x
+
3
y
−
λ
(
8
x
+
8
y
)
=
0
,
(
1
)
4x+3y−λ(8x+8y)=0,(1)
3
x
+
4
y
−
λ
(
8
x
+
10
y
)
=
0
,
(
2
)
3x+4y−λ(8x+10y)=0,(2)
4
x
2
+
8
x
y
+
5
y
2
=
1.
(
3
)
4x 
2
 +8xy+5y 
2
 =1.(3)
i need to solve for 
x
,
y
,
λ
x,y,λ.

let me rearrange equations (1) and (2):

from (1):

4
x
+
3
y
=
λ
(
8
x
+
8
y
)
,
4x+3y=λ(8x+8y),
from (2):

3
x
+
4
y
=
λ
(
8
x
+
10
y
)
.
3x+4y=λ(8x+10y).
i can write these as:

4
x
+
3
y
−
8
λ
x
−
8
λ
y
=
0
,
4x+3y−8λx−8λy=0,
3
x
+
4
y
−
8
λ
x
−
10
λ
y
=
0.
3x+4y−8λx−10λy=0.
let me factor:

x
(
4
−
8
λ
)
+
y
(
3
−
8
λ
)
=
0
,
(
1
a
)
x(4−8λ)+y(3−8λ)=0,(1a)
x
(
3
−
8
λ
)
+
y
(
4
−
10
λ
)
=
0.
(
2
a
)
x(3−8λ)+y(4−10λ)=0.(2a)
now, i have a system of linear equations in 
x
x and 
y
y. for non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero:

∣
4
−
8
λ
3
−
8
λ
3
−
8
λ
4
−
10
λ
 
∣
=
0.
​	
  
4−8λ
3−8λ
​	
  
3−8λ
4−10λ
​	
  
​	
 =0.
calculate the determinant:

(
4
−
8
λ
)
(
4
−
10
λ
)
−
(
3
−
8
λ
)
(
3
−
8
λ
)
=
0.
(4−8λ)(4−10λ)−(3−8λ)(3−8λ)=0.
expand 
(
4
−
8
λ
)
(
4
−
10
λ
)
(4−8λ)(4−10λ):

4
⋅
4
=
16
,
4⋅4=16,
4
⋅
(
−
10
λ
)
=
−
40
λ
,
4⋅(−10λ)=−40λ,
−
8
λ
⋅
4
=
−
32
λ
,
−8λ⋅4=−32λ,
−
8
λ
⋅
(
−
10
λ
)
=
80
λ
2
.
−8λ⋅(−10λ)=80λ 
2
 .
so, 
(
4
−
8
λ
)
(
4
−
10
λ
)
=
16
−
72
λ
+
80
λ
2
(4−8λ)(4−10λ)=16−72λ+80λ 
2
 .

now, expand 
(
3
−
8
λ
)
2
(3−8λ) 
2
 :

3
2
=
9
,
3 
2
 =9,
2
⋅
3
⋅
(
−
8
λ
)
=
−
48
λ
,
2⋅3⋅(−8λ)=−48λ,
(
−
8
λ
)
2
=
64
λ
2
.
(−8λ) 
2
 =64λ 
2
 .
so, 
(
3
−
8
λ
)
2
=
9
−
48
λ
+
64
λ
2
(3−8λ) 
2
 =9−48λ+64λ 
2
 .

now, set the determinant to zero:

(
16
−
72
λ
+
80
λ
2
)
−
(
9
−
48
λ
+
64
λ
2
)
=
0
,
(16−72λ+80λ 
2
 )−(9−48λ+64λ 
2
 )=0,
which simplifies to:

16
−
72
λ
+
80
λ
2
−
9
+
48
λ
−
64
λ
2
=
0
,
16−72λ+80λ 
2
 −9+48λ−64λ 
2
 =0,
combining like terms:

(
80
λ
2
−
64
λ
2
)
+
(
−
72
λ
+
48
λ
)
+
(
16
−
9
)
=
0
,
(80λ 
2
 −64λ 
2
 )+(−72λ+48λ)+(16−9)=0,
so:

16
λ
2
−
24
λ
+
7
=
0.
16λ 
2
 −24λ+7=0.
wait, this is the same quadratic equation i got earlier: 
16
λ
2
−
24
λ
+
7
=
0
16λ 
2
 −24λ+7=0.

so, solving for 
λ
λ again:

λ
=
24
±
(
−
24
)
2
−
4
⋅
16
⋅
7
2
⋅
16
=
24
±
576
−
448
32
=
24
±
128
32
=
24
±
8
2
32
=
3
±
2
4
.
λ= 
2⋅16
24± 
(−24) 
2
 −4⋅16⋅7
​	
 
​	
 = 
32
24± 
576−448
​	
 
​	
 = 
32
24± 
128
​	
 
​	
 = 
32
24±8 
2
​	
 
​	
 = 
4
3± 
2
​	
 
​	
 .
so, same eigenvalues as before. this confirms that the approach using matrices and eigenvalues is consistent with the lagrange multipliers method.

therefore, the product 
m
⋅
m
=
7
16
m⋅m= 
16
7
​	
  is correct.

alternatively, maybe i can try to diagonalize the quadratic forms or use a substitution to express one variable in terms of the other, but that might be more complicated.

another thought: perhaps i can parameterize 
x
x and 
y
y using trigonometric functions, considering the constraint as an ellipse.

let me consider that the equation 
4
x
2
+
8
x
y
+
5
y
2
=
1
4x 
2
 +8xy+5y 
2
 =1 represents an ellipse. maybe i can rotate the coordinate system to eliminate the 
x
y
xy term.

to eliminate the 
x
y
xy term, i need to rotate the axes by an angle 
θ
θ such that:

tan
⁡
(
2
θ
)
=
b
a
−
c
,
tan(2θ)= 
a−c
b
​	
 ,
where for the general quadratic equation 
a
x
2
+
b
x
y
+
c
y
2
=
1
ax 
2
 +bxy+cy 
2
 =1, here 
a
=
4
a=4, 
b
=
8
b=8, and 
c
=
5
c=5.

so,

tan
⁡
(
2
θ
)
=
8
4
−
5
=
8
−
1
=
−
8.
tan(2θ)= 
4−5
8
​	
 = 
−1
8
​	
 =−8.

 arctan(−8).

this seems messy, and i'm not sure if it will simplify the problem enough to find the extrema easily.

alternatively, maybe i can express 
y
y in terms of 
x
x from the constraint and substitute into the function to optimize.

from

this is a quadratic in

using the quadratic formula for

simplify inside the square root:

this seems complicated to substitute back into

 , and i might end up with a messy expression to find the extrema.

perhaps sticking with the eigenvalue approach is better, as it directly gives the extrema.

alternatively, maybe i can use the cauchy-schwarz inequality or some other inequality to bound the expression, but i'm not sure how to apply it here directly.

another idea: since both quadratic forms are positive definite (as their determinants are positive and leading coefficients are positive), perhaps i can use the rayleigh-ritz theorem, which relates the extrema of the ratio of quadratic forms to their generalized eigenvalues.

specifically, for positive definite matrices 
a
a and 
b
b, the extrema of 
x
t
b
x
x
t
a
x
x 
t
 ax
x 
t
 bx
​	
  are the generalized eigenvalues of 
b
b and 
a
a.

but in this problem, the constraint is 
x
t
a
x
=
1
x 
t
 ax=1, and we are to maximize/minimize 
x
t
b
x
x 
t
 bx.

according to the rayleigh-ritz theorem, the extrema are indeed the generalized eigenvalues 
λ
λ such that 
b
x
=
λ
a
x
bx=λax, which is the same as solving 
det
⁡
(
b
−
λ
a
)
=
0
det(b−λa)=0, which is exactly what i did earlier.

therefore, the eigenvalues 
λ
1
=
3
+
2
4
λ 
1
​	
 = 
4
3+ 
2
​	
 
​	
  and 
λ
2
=
3
−
2
4
λ 
2
​	
 = 
4
3− 
2
​	
 
​	
  are the maximum and minimum values, respectively.

therefore, their product is 
m
⋅
m
=
7
16
m⋅m= 
16

​	
 .

i think this is the correct answer.

**final answer**
