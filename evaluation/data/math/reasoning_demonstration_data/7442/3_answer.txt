Answer: Let \( x \) be the number of days sam worked, and \( y \) be the number of days he did not work. we know:

1. \( x + y = 20 \)
2. \( 60x - 30y = 660 \)

from the first equation, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 20 - y \]

substitute this into the second equation:

\[ 60(20 - y) - 30y = 660 \]
\[ 1200 - 60y - 30y = 660 \]
\[ 1200 - 90y = 660 \]
\[ -90y = 660 - 1200 \]
\[ -90y = -540 \]
\[ y = \frac{-540}{-90} \]
\[ y = 6 \]

thus, sam did not work for 6 days. to verify, if \( y = 6 \), then \( x = 20 - 6 = 14 \). his earnings would be:

\[ 14 \times 60 = 840 \]
\[ 6 \times 30 = 180 \]
\[ 840 - 180 = 660 \]

this matches the given total of $660. therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]
