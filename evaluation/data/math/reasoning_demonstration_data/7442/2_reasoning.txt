Reasoning: So i've got this problem here. sam is hired for a 20-day period. on days he works, he earns $60, and if he doesn't work a day, $30 is subtracted from his earnings. at the end of the 20 days, he received $660. the question is, how many days did he not work?

first, i need to figure out a way to set this up. maybe i can use some algebra here. let's see.

let me define some variables to make this easier. let's say:

let 
x
x be the number of days sam worked.

and 
y
y be the number of days he did not work.

i know that the total number of days is 20, so:

x
+
y
=
20
x+y=20

that's one equation.

now, for the earnings. for each day he works, he earns $60, so his total earnings from working days would be 
60
x
60x.

for each day he doesn't work, $30 is subtracted from his earnings. so, the total subtraction would be 
30
y
30y.

his total earnings would then be:

60
x
−
30
y
=
660
60x−30y=660

now i have two equations:

1. 
x
+
y
=
20
x+y=20

2. 
60
x
−
30
y
=
660
60x−30y=660

i can solve this system of equations to find the values of 
x
x and 
y
y.

maybe i can solve the first equation for one variable and substitute into the second equation.

from equation 1:

x
=
20
−
y
x=20−y

now, substitute this into equation 2:

60
(
20
−
y
)
−
30
y
=
660
60(20−y)−30y=660

let me simplify this:

first, distribute the 60:

60
×
20
=
1200
60×20=1200

60
×
(
−
y
)
=
−
60
y
60×(−y)=−60y

so:

1200
−
60
y
−
30
y
=
660
1200−60y−30y=660

combine like terms:

1200
−
90
y
=
660
1200−90y=660

now, subtract 1200 from both sides:

−
90
y
=
660
−
1200
−90y=660−1200

−
90
y
=
−
540
−90y=−540

now, divide both sides by -90:

y
=
−
540
−
90
y= 
−90
−540
​	
 

y
=
6
y=6

so, according to this, sam did not work for 6 days.

wait a minute, let me double-check that.

if 
y
=
6
y=6, then from equation 1:

x
=
20
−
6
=
14
x=20−6=14

so, he worked for 14 days and didn't work for 6 days.

let's check if this makes sense with the earnings.

he worked for 14 days at $60 per day:

14
×
60
=
840
14×60=840

he didn't work for 6 days, so $30 is subtracted each day:

6
×
30
=
180
6×30=180

total earnings:

840
−
180
=
660
840−180=660

yes, that matches the given total of $660. so, it seems correct.

but just to be thorough, maybe i can try another method to confirm.

alternatively, i can think of it in terms of net earnings per day.

on days he works, he earns $60.

on days he doesn't work, he loses $30.

so, the average per day can be calculated.

total earnings over 20 days is $660, so average per day is 
660
20
=
33
20
660
​	
 =33 dollars per day.

now, let's consider the net earnings per day.

let me define the net earnings per day as:

net earnings per day
=
earnings from working
−
loss from not working
net earnings per day=earnings from working−loss from not working

but that might not be the best way to think about it.

alternatively, think of it as:

if he worked all 20 days, he would have earned 
20
×
60
=
1200
20×60=1200 dollars.

but since he didn't work some days, for each day he didn't work, he loses $60 (the amount he would have earned from working) and actually loses an additional $30, so total loss per not working day is $90.

wait, that might be a different way to look at it.

wait, no. the problem says that for each day he doesn't work, $30 is subtracted from his earnings. it doesn't say he loses the $60 he would have earned plus an additional $30.

so, perhaps it's just that for days he doesn't work, $30 is subtracted, regardless of what he would have earned.

in that case, the total earnings can be seen as:

total earnings = (number of days worked × $60) − (number of days not worked × $30)

which is what i had earlier: 
60
x
−
30
y
=
660
60x−30y=660

and 
x
+
y
=
20
x+y=20

so, that seems consistent.

alternatively, maybe i can think about it in terms of the difference in earnings between working and not working.

if he works a day, he earns $60.

if he doesn't work, he loses $30.

so, the difference in earnings between working and not working is 
60
−
(
−
30
)
=
90
60−(−30)=90 dollars.

wait, no. if he doesn't work, $30 is subtracted, so it's like he has -$30 for that day.

so, the difference in earnings between working and not working is 
60
−
(
−
30
)
=
90
60−(−30)=90 dollars.

so, for each day he works instead of not working, he gains an additional $90.

now, if he had not worked all 20 days, he would have:

20
×
(
−
30
)
=
−
600
20×(−30)=−600 dollars.

but he actually received $660, which is $660 - (-600) = $1260 more than if he hadn't worked at all.

since each working day gives him an extra $90, the number of days he worked is 
1260
90
=
14
90
1260
​	
 =14 days.

therefore, he worked 14 days and didn't work 6 days.

this matches what i got earlier.

so, both methods confirm that he didn't work for 6 days.

i think that's solid.

**final answer**
