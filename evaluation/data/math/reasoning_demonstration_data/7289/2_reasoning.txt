Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: let 
r
r and 
s
s be the solutions to 
2
x
2
−
3
x
=
11
2x 
2
 −3x=11. i need to compute the value of 
(
4
r
3
−
4
s
3
)
(
r
−
s
)
−
1
(4r 
3
 −4s 
3
 )(r−s) 
−1
 .

first, i should probably solve the quadratic equation to find 
r
r and 
s
s, but that seems like it might get messy with square roots. maybe there's a smarter way to approach this using properties of quadratic equations and the relationships between the roots.

let me recall that for a quadratic equation of the form 
a
x
2
+
b
x
+
c
=
0
ax 
2
 +bx+c=0, the sum of the roots 
r
+
s
=
−
b
a
r+s=− 
a
b
​	
  and the product 
r
s
=
c
a
rs= 
a
c
​	
 . in this equation, it's 
2
x
2
−
3
x
−
11
=
0
2x 
2
 −3x−11=0, so 
a
=
2
a=2, 
b
=
−
3
b=−3, and 
c
=
−
11
c=−11.

therefore, the sum of the roots 
r
+
s
=
−
−
3
2
=
3
2
r+s=− 
2
−3
​	
 = 
2
3
​	
 , and the product 
r
s
=
−
11
2
rs= 
2
−11
​	
 .

now, the expression i need to compute is 
4
r
3
−
4
s
3
r
−
s
r−s
4r 
3
 −4s 
3
 
​	
 . i can factor out the 4 in the numerator:

4
(
r
3
−
s
3
)
r
−
s
r−s
4(r 
3
 −s 
3
 )
​	
 .

i remember that 
r
3
−
s
3
r 
3
 −s 
3
  can be factored using the difference of cubes formula:

r
3
−
s
3
=
(
r
−
s
)
(
r
2
+
r
s
+
s
2
)
r 
3
 −s 
3
 =(r−s)(r 
2
 +rs+s 
2
 ).

so plugging that in:

4
(
r
−
s
)
(
r
2
+
r
s
+
s
2
)
r
−
s
r−s
4(r−s)(r 
2
 +rs+s 
2
 )
​	
 .

the 
r
−
s
r−s terms cancel out, assuming 
r
≠
s
r

=s, which they aren't since it's a quadratic equation with two distinct roots.

so now i have 
4
(
r
2
+
r
s
+
s
2
)
4(r 
2
 +rs+s 
2
 ).

i need to find a way to express 
r
2
+
r
s
+
s
2
r 
2
 +rs+s 
2
  in terms of 
r
+
s
r+s and 
r
s
rs, since i already know those values.

i know that 
(
r
+
s
)
2
=
r
2
+
2
r
s
+
s
2
(r+s) 
2
 =r 
2
 +2rs+s 
2
 , so 
r
2
+
s
2
=
(
r
+
s
)
2
−
2
r
s
r 
2
 +s 
2
 =(r+s) 
2
 −2rs.

therefore, 
r
2
+
r
s
+
s
2
=
(
r
2
+
s
2
)
+
r
s
=
(
(
r
+
s
)
2
−
2
r
s
)
+
r
s
=
(
r
+
s
)
2
−
r
s
r 
2
 +rs+s 
2
 =(r 
2
 +s 
2
 )+rs=((r+s) 
2
 −2rs)+rs=(r+s) 
2
 −rs.

now, plugging in the known values:

(
r
+
s
)
2
=
(
3
2
)
2
=
9
4
(r+s) 
2
 =( 
2
3
​	
 ) 
2
 = 
4
9
​	
 ,

and 
r
s
=
−
11
2
rs=− 
2
11
​	
 .

so, 
r
2
+
r
s
+
s
2
=
9
4
−
(
−
11
2
)
=
9
4
+
11
2
r 
2
 +rs+s 
2
 = 
4
9
​	
 −(− 
2
11
​	
 )= 
4
9
​	
 + 
2
11
​	
 .

to add these fractions, i need a common denominator, which is 4:

9
4
+
22
4
=
31
4
4
9
​	
 + 
4
22
​	
 = 
4
31
​	
 .

therefore, the original expression simplifies to:

4
×
31
4
=
31
4× 
4
31
​	
 =31.

so the value of 
(
4
r
3
−
4
s
3
)
(
r
−
s
)
−
1
(4r 
3
 −4s 
3
 )(r−s) 
−1
  is 31.

**final answer**

31
