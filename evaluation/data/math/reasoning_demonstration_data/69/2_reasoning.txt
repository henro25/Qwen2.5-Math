Reasoning: So i need to find the product of all real numbers that are doubled when added to their reciprocals. hmm, let's try to understand what that means.

first, let's denote the real number we're looking for as 
x
x. according to the problem, when this number is added to its reciprocal, the result is double the original number. so, in equation form, that would be:

x
+
1
x
=
2
x
x+ 
x
1
​
 =2x
okay, that makes sense. now, i need to solve this equation to find the possible values of 
x
x, and then find the product of those values.

let's start by simplifying the equation. i can subtract 
x
x from both sides to get:

1
x
=
x
x
1
​
 =x
interesting. so, this implies that 
x
x is equal to its own reciprocal. that means 
x
×
x
=
1
x×x=1, or 
x
2
=
1
x 
2
 =1.

so, the solutions to this equation would be the square roots of 1, which are 
x
=
1
x=1 and 
x
=
−
1
x=−1.

now, i need to find the product of all real numbers that satisfy this condition. since the solutions are 1 and -1, their product would be:

1
×
(
−
1
)
=
−
1
1×(−1)=−1
wait a minute, let's double-check to make sure there are no other solutions. sometimes, when dealing with equations involving reciprocals, there might be restrictions or additional solutions to consider.

firstly, note that 
x
x cannot be zero because the reciprocal of zero is undefined. so, 
x
≠
0
x

=0.

let me go back to the original equation:

x
+
1
x
=
2
x
x+ 
x
1
​
 =2x
subtracting 
x
x from both sides gives:

1
x
=
x
x
1
​
 =x
multiplying both sides by 
x
x (which is valid since 
x
≠
0
x

=0):

1
=
x
2
1=x 
2
 
so, indeed, 
x
2
=
1
x 
2
 =1, leading to 
x
=
1
x=1 or 
x
=
−
1
x=−1. there are no other real solutions because any other value of 
x
x would not satisfy 
x
2
=
1
x 
2
 =1.

therefore, the only real numbers that satisfy the condition are 1 and -1, and their product is -1.

just to be thorough, let's plug these values back into the original equation to ensure they work.

first, for 
x
=
1
x=1:

1
+
1
1
=
1
+
1
=
2
1+ 
1
1
​
 =1+1=2
2
×
1
=
2
2×1=2
so, 
2
=
2
2=2, which checks out.

next, for 
x
=
−
1
x=−1:

−
1
+
1
−
1
=
−
1
−
1
=
−
2
−1+ 
−1
1
​
 =−1−1=−2
2
×
(
−
1
)
=
−
2
2×(−1)=−2
again, 
−
2
=
−
2
−2=−2, which also checks out.

therefore, both solutions are valid, and their product is indeed -1.

is there a way to approach this problem differently? maybe by manipulating the original equation in another way.

let's consider the original equation again:

x
+
1
x
=
2
x
x+ 
x
1
​
 =2x
i could subtract 
2
x
2x from both sides to set the equation to zero:

x
+
1
x
−
2
x
=
0
x+ 
x
1
​
 −2x=0
−
x
+
1
x
=
0
−x+ 
x
1
​
 =0
then, move 
x
x to the other side:

1
x
=
x
x
1
​
 =x
which is the same as before. so, no new information there.

alternatively, i could multiply both sides of the original equation by 
x
x to eliminate the denominator:

x
(
x
)
+
x
(
1
x
)
=
2
x
(
x
)
x(x)+x( 
x
1
​
 )=2x(x)
x
2
+
1
=
2
x
2
x 
2
 +1=2x 
2
 
then, subtract 
2
x
2
2x 
2
  from both sides:

−
x
2
+
1
=
0
−x 
2
 +1=0
x
2
=
1
x 
2
 =1
again, leading to 
x
=
1
x=1 or 
x
=
−
1
x=−1.

so, no matter how i approach it, i end up with the same solutions.

just to cover all bases, maybe i should consider if there are any complex solutions, but since the problem specifically asks for real numbers, i don't need to worry about that.

also, since the problem asks for the product of all such real numbers, and there are only two, their product is straightforward.

is there a general formula or theorem that relates to this kind of problem? maybe something about equations where a number and its reciprocal are related in a certain way.

i recall that for equations of the form 
x
+
1
x
=
k
x+ 
x
1
​
 =k, there are standard methods to solve for 
x
x. in this case, 
k
=
2
x
k=2x, which is a bit different because 
k
k is not a constant but depends on 
x
x.

wait, in the standard form 
x
+
1
x
=
k
x+ 
x
1
​
 =k, you can multiply both sides by 
x
x to get a quadratic equation:

x
2
−
k
x
+
1
=
0
x 
2
 −kx+1=0
and then solve for 
x
x using the quadratic formula.

in this problem, since 
k
=
2
x
k=2x, substituting that in would give:

x
2
−
2
x
⋅
x
+
1
=
0
x 
2
 −2x⋅x+1=0
x
2
−
2
x
2
+
1
=
0
x 
2
 −2x 
2
 +1=0
−
x
2
+
1
=
0
−x 
2
 +1=0
x
2
=
1
x 
2
 =1
again, leading to 
x
=
1
x=1 or 
x
=
−
1
x=−1.

so, multiple approaches confirm the same solutions.

maybe another way to think about it is to consider the function 
f
(
x
)
=
x
+
1
x
f(x)=x+ 
x
1
​
  and set it equal to 
2
x
2x, then find the points of intersection.

graphically, 
f
(
x
)
=
x
+
1
x
f(x)=x+ 
x
1
​
  has a hyperbolic shape, and 
2
x
2x is a straight line. their intersections would be at 
x
=
1
x=1 and 
x
=
−
1
x=−1, which matches our solutions.

alternatively, considering the behavior of 
f
(
x
)
f(x), as 
x
x approaches 0 from the positive side, 
f
(
x
)
f(x) goes to positive infinity, and as 
x
x approaches 0 from the negative side, 
f
(
x
)
f(x) goes to negative infinity. at 
x
=
1
x=1 and 
x
=
−
1
x=−1, 
f
(
x
)
=
2
f(x)=2 and 
f
(
x
)
=
−
2
f(x)=−2 respectively, which aligns with 
2
x
2x.

so, all these methods consistently point to the same conclusion.

in summary, the only real numbers that satisfy the condition are 1 and -1, and their product is -1.

**final answer**

−
1
−1
