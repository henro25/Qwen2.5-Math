Answer: To find the product of all real numbers that are doubled when added to their reciprocals, we start with the equation:

\[ x + \frac{1}{x} = 2x \]

subtracting \( x \) from both sides, we get:

\[ \frac{1}{x} = x \]

this implies:

\[ x^2 = 1 \]

thus, the solutions are:

\[ x = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -1 \]

the product of these solutions is:

\[ 1 \times (-1) = -1 \]

therefore, the product of all real numbers that are doubled when added to their reciprocals is:

\[
\boxed{-1}
\]
