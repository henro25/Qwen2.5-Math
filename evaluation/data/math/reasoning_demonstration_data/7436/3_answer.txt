Answer: Given that angle \( a \) lies in the second quadrant and \(\sin a = \frac{3}{4}\), we need to find \(\cos a\).

first, we use the pythagorean identity:
\[
\sin^2 a + \cos^2 a = 1
\]
given \(\sin a = \frac{3}{4}\), we have:
\[
\sin^2 a = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{16}
\]
substituting this into the identity:
\[
\frac{9}{16} + \cos^2 a = 1
\]
solving for \(\cos^2 a\):
\[
\cos^2 a = 1 - \frac{9}{16} = \frac{16}{16} - \frac{9}{16} = \frac{7}{16}
\]
taking the square root of both sides:
\[
\cos a = \pm \sqrt{\frac{7}{16}} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{7}}{4}
\]
since angle \( a \) is in the second quadrant, where cosine is negative, we have:
\[
\cos a = -\frac{\sqrt{7}}{4}
\]

thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{-\frac{\sqrt{7}}{4}}
\]
