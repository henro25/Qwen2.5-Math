Reasoning: So i have this problem here: if 
w
z
=
12
−
8
i
wz=12−8i and 
∣
w
∣
=
13
∣w∣= 
13
​
 , what is 
∣
z
∣
∣z∣? hmm, okay, let's see. i remember that when you multiply two complex numbers, their magnitudes multiply. so, maybe that's the key here.

first, let's recall what the magnitude of a complex number is. if you have a complex number 
a
+
b
i
a+bi, its magnitude is 
a
2
+
b
2
a 
2
 +b 
2
 
​
 . so, for example, if 
w
=
a
+
b
i
w=a+bi, then 
∣
w
∣
=
a
2
+
b
2
∣w∣= 
a 
2
 +b 
2
 
​
 .

now, i have 
w
z
=
12
−
8
i
wz=12−8i. if i think about the magnitudes, 
∣
w
z
∣
=
∣
w
∣
×
∣
z
∣
∣wz∣=∣w∣×∣z∣. that's a property of complex numbers. so, if i can find 
∣
w
z
∣
∣wz∣, and i already know 
∣
w
∣
∣w∣, i can solve for 
∣
z
∣
∣z∣.

let me compute 
∣
w
z
∣
∣wz∣. since 
w
z
=
12
−
8
i
wz=12−8i, its magnitude is 
1
2
2
+
(
−
8
)
2
=
144
+
64
=
208
12 
2
 +(−8) 
2
 
​
 = 
144+64
​
 = 
208
​
 . hmm, 
208
208
​
  seems a bit messy. maybe i can simplify it. let's see, 208 divided by 16 is 13, so 
208
=
16
×
13
=
4
13
208
​
 = 
16×13
​
 =4 
13
​
 .

okay, so 
∣
w
z
∣
=
4
13
∣wz∣=4 
13
​
 , and i know 
∣
w
∣
=
13
∣w∣= 
13
​
 . plugging into the equation 
∣
w
z
∣
=
∣
w
∣
×
∣
z
∣
∣wz∣=∣w∣×∣z∣, i get 
4
13
=
13
×
∣
z
∣
4 
13
​
 = 
13
​
 ×∣z∣.

now, to solve for 
∣
z
∣
∣z∣, i can divide both sides by 
13
13
​
 . so, 
∣
z
∣
=
4
13
13
∣z∣= 
13
​
 
4 
13
​
 
​
 . the 
13
13
​
  in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving 
∣
z
∣
=
4
∣z∣=4.

wait a minute, does that make sense? let me double-check. if 
∣
w
∣
=
13
∣w∣= 
13
​
  and 
∣
z
∣
=
4
∣z∣=4, then 
∣
w
z
∣
=
∣
w
∣
×
∣
z
∣
=
13
×
4
=
4
13
∣wz∣=∣w∣×∣z∣= 
13
​
 ×4=4 
13
​
 , which matches what i calculated earlier for 
∣
w
z
∣
∣wz∣. so, it seems consistent.

alternatively, maybe i should think about this in terms of the complex plane. if 
w
w and 
z
z are complex numbers, their product 
w
z
wz is another complex number, and the magnitudes multiply. so, yeah, that still aligns with what i did above.

is there another way to approach this problem? maybe by expressing 
w
w and 
z
z in polar form. let's see. if 
w
=
r
w
e
i
θ
w
w=r 
w
​
 e 
iθ 
w
​
 
  and 
z
=
r
z
e
i
θ
z
z=r 
z
​
 e 
iθ 
z
​
 
 , then 
w
z
=
r
w
r
z
e
i
(
θ
w
+
θ
z
)
wz=r 
w
​
 r 
z
​
 e 
i(θ 
w
​
 +θ 
z
​
 )
 . the magnitude of 
w
z
wz is 
r
w
r
z
r 
w
​
 r 
z
​
 , which again is 
∣
w
∣
×
∣
z
∣
∣w∣×∣z∣. so, this confirms the earlier property.

i think i'm confident with the answer 
∣
z
∣
=
4
∣z∣=4.

**final answer**

4
