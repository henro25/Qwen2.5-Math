Reasoning: So i've got this equation to solve: 
arccos
⁡
2
x
−
arccos
⁡
x
=
π
3
arccos2x−arccosx= 
3
π
​	
 . alright, let's see how to approach this. i'm a bit rusty on inverse trigonometric functions, but i remember some properties that might help.

first off, let's recall what 
arccos
⁡
arccos means. if i have 
arccos
⁡
y
=
θ
arccosy=θ, that means 
cos
⁡
θ
=
y
cosθ=y and 
θ
θ is in the range 
[
0
,
π
]
[0,π]. so, in this equation, both 
arccos
⁡
2
x
arccos2x and 
arccos
⁡
x
arccosx are angles whose cosines are 
2
x
2x and 
x
x, respectively.

let me denote 
α
=
arccos
⁡
x
α=arccosx and 
β
=
arccos
⁡
2
x
β=arccos2x. then the equation becomes 
β
−
α
=
π
3
β−α= 
3
π
​	
 .

since 
α
=
arccos
⁡
x
α=arccosx, we have 
cos
⁡
α
=
x
cosα=x, and similarly, 
cos
⁡
β
=
2
x
cosβ=2x.

now, i need to find a relationship between 
α
α and 
β
β given that their difference is 
π
3
3
π
​	
 . maybe i can use trigonometric identities to relate 
cos
⁡
β
cosβ and 
cos
⁡
α
cosα.

i know that 
β
=
α
+
π
3
β=α+ 
3
π
​	
 , so i can express 
cos
⁡
β
cosβ in terms of 
α
α:

cos
⁡
β
=
cos
⁡
(
α
+
π
3
)
cosβ=cos(α+ 
3
π
​	
 )
using the cosine addition formula:

cos
⁡
(
α
+
γ
)
=
cos
⁡
α
cos
⁡
γ
−
sin
⁡
α
sin
⁡
γ
cos(α+γ)=cosαcosγ−sinαsinγ
so, plugging in 
γ
=
π
3
γ= 
3
π
​	
 :

cos
⁡
(
α
+
π
3
)
=
cos
⁡
α
cos
⁡
π
3
−
sin
⁡
α
sin
⁡
π
3
cos(α+ 
3
π
​	
 )=cosαcos 
3
π
​	
 −sinαsin 
3
π
​	
 
i know that 
cos
⁡
π
3
=
1
2
cos 
3
π
​	
 = 
2
1
​	
  and 
sin
⁡
π
3
=
3
2
sin 
3
π
​	
 = 
2
3
​	
 
​	
 , so:

cos
⁡
(
α
+
π
3
)
=
cos
⁡
α
⋅
1
2
−
sin
⁡
α
⋅
3
2
cos(α+ 
3
π
​	
 )=cosα⋅ 
2
1
​	
 −sinα⋅ 
2
3
​	
 
​	
 
but 
cos
⁡
β
=
2
x
cosβ=2x and 
cos
⁡
α
=
x
cosα=x, so:

2
x
=
1
2
x
−
3
2
sin
⁡
α
2x= 
2
1
​	
 x− 
2
3
​	
 
​	
 sinα
hmm, this seems a bit messy. maybe there's a better way to approach this.

let me try another angle. i have 
arccos
⁡
2
x
−
arccos
⁡
x
=
π
3
arccos2x−arccosx= 
3
π
​	
 . maybe i can set 
θ
=
arccos
⁡
x
θ=arccosx, so 
x
=
cos
⁡
θ
x=cosθ, and then 
arccos
⁡
2
x
=
arccos
⁡
(
2
cos
⁡
θ
)
arccos2x=arccos(2cosθ). so the equation becomes:

arccos
⁡
(
2
cos
⁡
θ
)
−
θ
=
π
3
arccos(2cosθ)−θ= 
3
π
​	
 
which means:

arccos
⁡
(
2
cos
⁡
θ
)
=
θ
+
π
3
arccos(2cosθ)=θ+ 
3
π
​	
 
now, taking cosine of both sides:

2
cos
⁡
θ
=
cos
⁡
(
θ
+
π
3
)
2cosθ=cos(θ+ 
3
π
​	
 )
again, using the cosine addition formula:

cos
⁡
(
θ
+
π
3
)
=
cos
⁡
θ
⋅
1
2
−
sin
⁡
θ
⋅
3
2
cos(θ+ 
3
π
​	
 )=cosθ⋅ 
2
1
​	
 −sinθ⋅ 
2
3
​	
 
​	
 
so:

2
cos
⁡
θ
=
1
2
cos
⁡
θ
−
3
2
sin
⁡
θ
2cosθ= 
2
1
​	
 cosθ− 
2
3
​	
 
​	
 sinθ
let me rearrange this:

2
cos
⁡
θ
−
1
2
cos
⁡
θ
+
3
2
sin
⁡
θ
=
0
2cosθ− 
2
1
​	
 cosθ+ 
2
3
​	
 
​	
 sinθ=0
combining like terms:

3
2
cos
⁡
θ
+
3
2
sin
⁡
θ
=
0
2
3
​	
 cosθ+ 
2
3
​	
 
​	
 sinθ=0
i can factor out 
1
2
2
1
​	
 :

1
2
(
3
cos
⁡
θ
+
3
sin
⁡
θ
)
=
0
2
1
​	
 (3cosθ+ 
3
​	
 sinθ)=0
so:

3
cos
⁡
θ
+
3
sin
⁡
θ
=
0
3cosθ+ 
3
​	
 sinθ=0
this looks like a linear combination of sine and cosine, which can be expressed as a single sine or cosine function. i recall that 
a
cos
⁡
θ
+
b
sin
⁡
θ
=
r
cos
⁡
(
θ
−
ϕ
)
acosθ+bsinθ=rcos(θ−ϕ), where 
r
=
a
2
+
b
2
r= 
a 
2
 +b 
2
 
​	
  and 
tan
⁡
ϕ
=
b
a
tanϕ= 
a
b
​	
 .

so, in this case, 
a
=
3
a=3 and 
b
=
3
b= 
3
​	
 , so:

r
=
3
2
+
(
3
)
2
=
9
+
3
=
12
=
2
3
r= 
3 
2
 +( 
3
​	
 ) 
2
 
​	
 = 
9+3
​	
 = 
12
​	
 =2 
3
​	
 
and:

tan
⁡
ϕ
=
3
3
=
1
3
  
⟹
  
ϕ
=
π
6
tanϕ= 
3
3
​	
 
​	
 = 
3
​	
 
1
​	
 ⟹ϕ= 
6
π
​	
 
therefore:

3
cos
⁡
θ
+
3
sin
⁡
θ
=
2
3
cos
⁡
(
θ
−
π
6
)
3cosθ+ 
3
​	
 sinθ=2 
3
​	
 cos(θ− 
6
π
​	
 )
so, the equation becomes:

2
3
cos
⁡
(
θ
−
π
6
)
=
0
2 
3
​	
 cos(θ− 
6
π
​	
 )=0
which implies:

cos
⁡
(
θ
−
π
6
)
=
0
cos(θ− 
6
π
​	
 )=0
the solutions to 
cos
⁡
ϕ
=
0
cosϕ=0 are 
ϕ
=
π
2
+
k
π
ϕ= 
2
π
​	
 +kπ, where 
k
k is an integer.

therefore:

θ
−
π
6
=
π
2
+
k
π
  
⟹
  
θ
=
π
2
+
π
6
+
k
π
=
2
π
3
+
k
π
θ− 
6
π
​	
 = 
2
π
​	
 +kπ⟹θ= 
2
π
​	
 + 
6
π
​	
 +kπ= 
3
2π
​	
 +kπ
now, recall that 
θ
=
arccos
⁡
x
θ=arccosx, and 
arccos
⁡
x
arccosx is defined for 
x
∈
[
−
1
,
1
]
x∈[−1,1] and returns values in 
[
0
,
π
]
[0,π].

so, 
θ
=
2
π
3
+
k
π
θ= 
3
2π
​	
 +kπ, but 
θ
θ must be in 
[
0
,
π
]
[0,π].

let's consider 
k
=
0
k=0:

θ
=
2
π
3
θ= 
3
2π
​	
 
which is within 
[
0
,
π
]
[0,π].

now, 
k
=
−
1
k=−1:

θ
=
2
π
3
−
π
=
−
π
3
θ= 
3
2π
​	
 −π=− 
3
π
​	
 
which is not in 
[
0
,
π
]
[0,π].

k
=
1
k=1:

θ
=
2
π
3
+
π
=
5
π
3
θ= 
3
2π
​	
 +π= 
3
5π
​	
 
which is greater than 
π
π, so not in 
[
0
,
π
]
[0,π].

therefore, the only solution for 
θ
θ is 
2
π
3
3
2π
​	
 .

now, since 
θ
=
arccos
⁡
x
θ=arccosx, we have:

x
=
cos
⁡
(
2
π
3
)
=
−
1
2
x=cos( 
3
2π
​	
 )=− 
2
1
​	
 
but wait a minute, i need to check if this solution satisfies the original equation.

let's plug 
x
=
−
1
2
x=− 
2
1
​	
  into the original equation:

arccos
⁡
(
2
⋅
−
1
2
)
−
arccos
⁡
(
−
1
2
)
=
arccos
⁡
(
−
1
)
−
arccos
⁡
(
−
1
2
)
arccos(2⋅− 
2
1
​	
 )−arccos(− 
2
1
​	
 )=arccos(−1)−arccos(− 
2
1
​	
 )
we know that 
arccos
⁡
(
−
1
)
=
π
arccos(−1)=π and 
arccos
⁡
(
−
1
2
)
=
2
π
3
arccos(− 
2
1
​	
 )= 
3
2π
​	
 , so:

π
−
2
π
3
=
π
3
π− 
3
2π
​	
 = 
3
π
​	
 
which matches the right-hand side of the equation. so, 
x
=
−
1
2
x=− 
2
1
​	
  is a valid solution.

however, i should check if there are any other possible solutions. maybe i missed something.

let me go back to where i had:

cos
⁡
(
θ
−
π
6
)
=
0
cos(θ− 
6
π
​	
 )=0
which gave me:

θ
=
π
2
+
π
6
+
k
π
=
2
π
3
+
k
π
θ= 
2
π
​	
 + 
6
π
​	
 +kπ= 
3
2π
​	
 +kπ
but perhaps there are more solutions within the domain of 
arccos
⁡
arccos.

wait, let's consider that 
arccos
⁡
2
x
arccos2x must also be defined. that is, 
2
x
2x must be in 
[
−
1
,
1
]
[−1,1], because the domain of 
arccos
⁡
arccos is 
[
−
1
,
1
]
[−1,1].

so, 
2
x
∈
[
−
1
,
1
]
  
⟹
  
x
∈
[
−
1
2
,
1
2
]
2x∈[−1,1]⟹x∈[− 
2
1
​	
 , 
2
1
​	
 ].

but from earlier, we have 
x
=
−
1
2
x=− 
2
1
​	
 , which is within this interval.

is there another value of 
x
x that could satisfy the equation?

let me think differently. suppose i let 
α
=
arccos
⁡
x
α=arccosx and 
β
=
arccos
⁡
2
x
β=arccos2x, with 
β
−
α
=
π
3
β−α= 
3
π
​	
 .

i can express 
β
β in terms of 
α
α: 
β
=
α
+
π
3
β=α+ 
3
π
​	
 .

now, since 
cos
⁡
β
=
2
x
cosβ=2x and 
cos
⁡
α
=
x
cosα=x, and 
β
=
α
+
π
3
β=α+ 
3
π
​	
 , maybe i can use the double angle formula or something similar.

wait, perhaps i can use the cosine of 
β
β in terms of 
α
α:

cos
⁡
β
=
cos

(
α

​

but 
cos
⁡
β
=
2
x
cosβ=2x and 
cos
⁡
α
=
x
cosα=x, so:

2
x
=

2
x
−
3
2
sin
⁡
α
2x= 
2
1
​	
 x−

3
​	
 
​	
 sinα
this simplifies to:

2
x
−

2
x
=
−
3
2
sin
⁡
α
  
⟹
  
3
2
x

​	
 x=−

then:

x

x
sinα=− 
3
​	
 
3x
​

3
​	
 x
but since 
α

x
α=arccosx, and 
sin
⁡
(
arccos
⁡
x
)
=
1
−
x
2
sin(arccosx)= 
1−x

 , we have:

1
−
x

x

​

3
​	
 x
wait, but 
1
−
x
2
1−x 
2
 
​	
  is always non-negative, and 
−
3
x
− 
3
​	
 x could be positive or negative depending on 
x
x. so, for this equation to hold, 
−
3
x
− 
3
​	
 x must be non-negative, meaning 
x
≤
0
x≤0.

so, we have:

1
−
x
2
=
−
3
x
1−x 
2
 
​	
 =− 
3
​	
 x
let's square both sides to eliminate the square root:

1
−
x

=
3
x
2
  
⟹

=

x

⟹

⟹

 ⟹1=4x 
2
 ⟹x

​	
 ⟹x=± 
2
1
​	
 
but earlier, we determined that 
x
=
−
1
2
x=− 
2
1
​	
  is a solution, and 
x
=
1
2
x= 
2
1
​	
  needs to be checked.

let's check 
x
=
1
2
x= 
2
1
​	
 :

plug into the original equation:

arccos
⁡
(

−
arccos

(

=

arccos(2⋅

 )=arccos(1)−arccos( 
2
1
​	
 )=0− 
3
π
​	
 =− 
3
π
​	
 
but the equation is 
arccos
⁡
2
x
−
arccos
⁡
x
=
π
3
arccos2x−arccosx= 
3
π
​	
 , which is not satisfied by 
x
=
1
2
x= 
2
1
​	
 , since 
−
π
3
≠
π
3
− 
3
π
​	
 

= 
3
π
​	
 .

therefore, 
x
=
1
2
x= 
2
1
​	
  is not a solution.

hence, the only solution is 
x
=
−
1
2
x=− 
2
1
​	
 .

wait, but earlier i thought there might be another solution. maybe i should consider the general solution for 
θ
θ.

recall that 
θ
=
arccos
⁡
x
=
2
π
3
+
k
π
θ=arccosx= 
3
2π
​	
 +kπ, but within 
[
0
,
π
]
[0,π], only 
θ
=
2
π
3
θ= 
3
2π
​	
  is valid.

alternatively, perhaps there are multiple solutions if i consider different branches or something, but in this case, it seems that only one solution exists.

let me double-check by graphing or considering the behavior of the functions involved.

consider the function 
f
(
x
)
=
arccos
⁡
2
x
−
arccos
⁡
x
f(x)=arccos2x−arccosx. i need to find where this equals 
π
3
3
π
​	
 .

the domain is where both 
arccos
⁡
2
x
arccos2x and 
arccos
⁡
x
arccosx are defined, which is 
x
∈
[
−
1
2
,
1
2
]
x∈[− 
2

​	
 , 
2
1
​	
 ], since 
2
x
2x must be in 
[
−

,
1
]
[−1,1].

let's consider the behavior of 
f
(
x
)
f(x) over this interval.

at 
x
=
−
1
2
x=− 
2

​	
 :

f

is there any other point in

 ? maybe i should check the derivative to see if there are multiple crossings.

the derivative

hmm, it's undefined at

arccos

again, undefined at 
x
=

x=

​	
 .

overall, it seems that 
f
(
x
)
f(x) is decreasing in the interval 
[
−
1
2
,
1
2
]
[− 
2

 ,

​	
 ], starting from 
π

π
​	
  at 
x
=
−

x=− 
2

​	
 , decreasing to 
−
π
3
− 
3
π
​	
  at 
x
=
1
2
x= 
2
1
​	
 . therefore, there's only one point where 
f
(
x
)
=
π
3
f(x)= 
3
π
​	
 , which is at 
x
=
−
1
2
x=− 
2
1
​	
 .

so, the only solution is 
x
=
−
1
2
x=− 
2
1
​	
 .

but to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other solutions outside of this interval. however, since 
2
x
2x must be in 
[
−
1
,
1
]
[−1,1], 
x
x must be in 
[
−
1
2
,
1
2
]
[− 
2
1
​	
 , 
2
1
​	
 ], so no need to check beyond that.

therefore, the solution is 
x
=
−
1
2
x=− 
2
1
​	
 .
