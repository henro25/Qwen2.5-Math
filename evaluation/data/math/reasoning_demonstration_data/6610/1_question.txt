Problem: In Zuminglish, all words consist only of the letters $M, O,$ and $P$. As in English, $O$ is said to be a vowel and $M$ and $P$ are consonants. A string of $M's, O's,$ and $P's$ is a word in Zuminglish if and only if between any two $O's$ there appear at least two consonants. Let $N$ denote the number of $10$-letter Zuminglish words. Determine the remainder obtained when $N$ is divided by $1000$.
