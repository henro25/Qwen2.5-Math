Reasoning: So i have this problem here. there are three lines and some points, and i need to find the slope of one of the lines. let me try to understand what's going on step by step.

first, there's line 
l
1
l 
1
​	
  with the equation 
3
x
−
2
y
=
1
3x−2y=1, and it goes through point 
a
=
(
−
1
,
−
2
)
a=(−1,−2). i guess i should confirm that point 
a
a lies on 
l
1
l 
1
​	
 . to do that, i can plug in the coordinates of 
a
a into the equation of 
l
1
l 
1
​	
 .

so, plugging in 
x
=
−
1
x=−1 and 
y
=
−
2
y=−2:

3
(
−
1
)
−
2
(
−
2
)
=
−
3
+
4
=
1
3(−1)−2(−2)=−3+4=1

yes, that equals 1, which matches the equation. so point 
a
a is indeed on 
l
1
l 
1
​	
 .

next, there's line 
l
2
l 
2
​	
  with the equation 
y
=
1
y=1. that's a horizontal line at 
y
=
1
y=1. it meets line 
l
1
l 
1
​	
  at point 
b
b. so, to find point 
b
b, i need to find the intersection of 
l
1
l 
1
​	
  and 
l
2
l 
2
​	
 .

since 
l
2
l 
2
​	
  is 
y
=
1
y=1, i can substitute 
y
=
1
y=1 into the equation of 
l
1
l 
1
​	
 :

3
x
−
2
(
1
)
=
1
3x−2(1)=1

simplifying:

3
x
−
2
=
1
3x−2=1

adding 2 to both sides:

3
x
=
3
3x=3

dividing both sides by 3:

x
=
1
x=1

so, point 
b
b has coordinates 
(
1
,
1
)
(1,1).

now, there's line 
l
3
l 
3
​	
 , which has a positive slope, goes through point 
a
a, and meets 
l
2
l 
2
​	
  at point 
c
c. the area of triangle 
a
b
c
abc is 3, and i need to find the slope of 
l
3
l 
3
​	
 .

first, since 
l
3
l 
3
​	
  goes through point 
a
=
(
−
1
,
−
2
)
a=(−1,−2) and has a positive slope, let's denote the slope as 
m
m, where 
m
>
0
m>0. the equation of 
l
3
l 
3
​	
  can be written in point-slope form:

y
−
y
1
=
m
(
x
−
x
1
)
y−y 
1
​	
 =m(x−x 
1
​	
 )

plugging in 
a
=
(
−
1
,
−
2
)
a=(−1,−2):

y
−
(
−
2
)
=
m
(
x
−
(
−
1
)
)
y−(−2)=m(x−(−1))

simplifying:

y
+
2
=
m
(
x
+
1
)
y+2=m(x+1)

so, the equation of 
l
3
l 
3
​	
  is:

y
=
m
(
x
+
1
)
−
2
y=m(x+1)−2

now, 
l
3
l 
3
​	
  meets 
l
2
l 
2
​	
  at point 
c
c. since 
l
2
l 
2
​	
  is 
y
=
1
y=1, i can set 
y
=
1
y=1 in the equation of 
l
3
l 
3
​	
  to find the x-coordinate of 
c
c:

1
=
m
(
x
+
1
)
−
2
1=m(x+1)−2

solving for 
x
x:

m
(
x
+
1
)
=
3
m(x+1)=3

x
+
1
=
3
m
x+1= 
m
3
​	
 

x
=
3
m
−
1
x= 
m
3
​	
 −1

so, point 
c
c has coordinates 
(
3
m
−
1
,
1
)
( 
m
3
​	
 −1,1).

now, i have points 
a
=
(
−
1
,
−
2
)
a=(−1,−2), 
b
=
(
1
,
1
)
b=(1,1), and 
c
=
(
3
m
−
1
,
1
)
c=( 
m
3
​	
 −1,1). i need to find the area of triangle 
a
b
c
abc and set it equal to 3.

to find the area of a triangle given three points, i can use the shoelace formula. the formula is:

area
=
1
2
∣
x
1
(
y
2
−
y
3
)
+
x
2
(
y
3
−
y
1
)
+
x
3
(
y
1
−
y
2
)
∣
area= 
2
1
​	
 ∣x 
1
​	
 (y 
2
​	
 −y 
3
​	
 )+x 
2
​	
 (y 
3
​	
 −y 
1
​	
 )+x 
3
​	
 (y 
1
​	
 −y 
2
​	
 )∣

plugging in the coordinates:

area
=
1
2
∣
(
−
1
)
(
1
−
1
)
+
1
(
1
−
(
−
2
)
)
+
(
3
m
−
1
)
(
−
2
−
1
)
∣
area= 
2
1
​	
 ∣(−1)(1−1)+1(1−(−2))+( 
m
3
​	
 −1)(−2−1)∣

simplify each part step by step.

first, 
(
−
1
)
(
1
−
1
)
=
(
−
1
)
(
0
)
=
0
(−1)(1−1)=(−1)(0)=0

second, 
1
(
1
−
(
−
2
)
)
=
1
(
3
)
=
3
1(1−(−2))=1(3)=3

third, 
(
3
m
−
1
)
(
−
2
−
1
)
=
(
3
m
−
1
)
(
−
3
)
=
−
3
(
3
m
−
1
)
=
−
9
m
+
3
( 
m
3
​	
 −1)(−2−1)=( 
m
3
​	
 −1)(−3)=−3( 
m
3
​	
 −1)=− 
m
9
​	
 +3

now, summing these up:

0
+
3
+
(
−
9
m
+
3
)
=
3
−
9
m
+
3
=
6
−
9
m
0+3+(− 
m
9
​	
 +3)=3− 
m
9
​	
 +3=6− 
m
9
​	
 

so, the area is:

1
2
∣
6
−
9
m
∣
2
1
​	
 ∣6− 
m
9
​	
 ∣

and we know this area is equal to 3:

1
2
∣
6
−
9
m
∣
=
3
2
1
​	
 ∣6− 
m
9
​	
 ∣=3

multiply both sides by 2:

∣
6
−
9
m
∣
=
6
∣6− 
m
9
​	
 ∣=6

now, solve for 
m
m:

case 1: 
6
−
9
m
=
6
6− 
m
9
​	
 =6

subtract 6 from both sides:

−
9
m
=
0
− 
m
9
​	
 =0

this implies 
m
m is infinite, which isn't possible for a line with a positive slope.

case 2: 
6
−
9
m
=
−
6
6− 
m
9
​	
 =−6

subtract 6 from both sides:

−
9
m
=
−
12
− 
m
9
​	
 =−12

multiply both sides by 
−
1
−1:

9
m
=
12
m
9
​	
 =12

now, solve for 
m
m:

m
=
9
12
=
3
4
m= 
12
9
​	
 = 
4
3
​	
 

so, the slope of 
l
3
l 
3
​	
  is 
3
4
4
3
​	
 .

wait a second, let me check if this makes sense.

given that 
m
=
3
4
m= 
4
3
​	
 , point 
c
c would be:

x
=
3
3
4
−
1
=
4
−
1
=
3
x= 
4
3
​	
 
3
​	
 −1=4−1=3

so, 
c
=
(
3
,
1
)
c=(3,1)

now, let's confirm the area of triangle 
a
b
c
abc with points 
a
(
−
1
,
−
2
)
a(−1,−2), 
b
(
1
,
1
)
b(1,1), and 
c
(
3
,
1
)
c(3,1).

using the shoelace formula again:

area
=
1
2
∣
(
−
1
)
(
1
−
1
)
+
1
(
1
−
(
−
2
)
)
+
3
(
−
2
−
1
)
∣
area= 
2
1
​	
 ∣(−1)(1−1)+1(1−(−2))+3(−2−1)∣

simplify:

1
2
∣
0
+
3
+
(
−
9
)
∣
=
1
2
∣
−
6
∣
=
3
2
1
​	
 ∣0+3+(−9)∣= 
2
1
​	
 ∣−6∣=3

yes, that matches the given area of 3.

so, the slope of 
l
3
l 
3
​	
  is indeed 
3
4
4
3
​	
 .
