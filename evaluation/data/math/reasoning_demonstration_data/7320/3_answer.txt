Answer: First, we confirm that point \( a = (-1, -2) \) lies on line \( l_1 \) with equation \( 3x - 2y = 1 \):

\[
3(-1) - 2(-2) = -3 + 4 = 1
\]

next, we find the intersection point \( b \) of \( l_1 \) and \( l_2 \) (where \( l_2 \) is \( y = 1 \)):

\[
3x - 2(1) = 1 \implies 3x - 2 = 1 \implies 3x = 3 \implies x = 1
\]

thus, point \( b \) is \( (1, 1) \).

for line \( l_3 \), which has a positive slope \( m \) and passes through \( a \), we use the point-slope form:

\[
y + 2 = m(x + 1) \implies y = m(x + 1) - 2
\]

to find point \( c \), where \( l_3 \) meets \( l_2 \) ( \( y = 1 \)):

\[
1 = m(x + 1) - 2 \implies m(x + 1) = 3 \implies x + 1 = \frac{3}{m} \implies x = \frac{3}{m} - 1
\]

thus, point \( c \) is \( \left( \frac{3}{m} - 1, 1 \right) \).

using the shoelace formula to find the area of triangle \( abc \):

\[
\text{area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| (-1)(1 - 1) + 1(1 - (-2)) + \left( \frac{3}{m} - 1 \right)(-2 - 1) \right|
\]

simplifying:

\[
0 + 3 + \left( -\frac{9}{m} + 3 \right) = 6 - \frac{9}{m}
\]

given the area is 3:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left| 6 - \frac{9}{m} \right| = 3 \implies \left| 6 - \frac{9}{m} \right| = 6
\]

solving for \( m \):

\[
6 - \frac{9}{m} = 6 \implies -\frac{9}{m} = 0 \quad (\text{not possible})
\]
\[
6 - \frac{9}{m} = -6 \implies -\frac{9}{m} = -12 \implies \frac{9}{m} = 12 \implies m = \frac{9}{12} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

thus, the slope of \( l_3 \) is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}
\]
