Problem: The solutions to the equation $(z+6)^8=81$ are connected in the complex plane to form a convex regular polygon, three of whose vertices are labeled $A,B,$ and $C$. What is the least possible area of triangle $ABC$?

Enter your answer in the form $\frac{a \sqrt{b} - c}{d},$ and simplified as usual.
