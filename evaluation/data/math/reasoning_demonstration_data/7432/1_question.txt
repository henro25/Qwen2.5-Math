Problem: The letters of the alphabet are given numeric values based on the two conditions below.

$\bullet$  Only the numeric values of $-2,$ $-1,$ $0,$ $1$ and $2$ are used.

$\bullet$  Starting with A and going through Z, a numeric value is assigned to each letter according to the following pattern: $$
1, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -1, 0,\ldots
$$

Two complete cycles of the pattern are shown above. The letter A has a value of $1,$ B has a value of $2,$ F has a value of $-2$ and Z has a value of $2.$ What is the sum of the numeric values of the letters in the word ``numeric''?
