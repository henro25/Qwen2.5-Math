Problem: Megan has lost Fatima's phone number. Megan knows that the first three digits are either 296 or 299. The remaining four digits are 0, 1, 6 and 7, but she isn't sure of the order of these digits. If Megan randomly dials a seven-digit number that meets these conditions, what is the probability that she dials Fatima's correct number? Express your answer as a common fraction.
