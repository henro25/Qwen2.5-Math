Reasoning: Let's see. so, there are 5 blue chips, 4 red chips, and 3 yellow chips in a bag. that makes a total of 5 + 4 + 3 = 12 chips in the bag. the problem says that one chip is drawn from the bag, and then it's placed back into the bag before drawing a second chip. we need to find the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors.

first, since the chip is replaced back into the bag after the first draw, the two draws are independent events. that means the outcome of the first draw doesn't affect the outcome of the second draw. this is important because it simplifies the calculations.

now, i need to find the probability that the two chips are of different colors. one way to approach this is to calculate the probability that the two chips are of the same color and then subtract that from 1, since the only other possibility is that they are of different colors.

so, let's calculate the probability that both chips are blue. the probability of drawing a blue chip on the first draw is 5 out of 12, because there are 5 blue chips and 12 total chips. since the chip is replaced, the probability of drawing a blue chip on the second draw is also 5 out of 12. so, the probability that both chips are blue is (5/12) * (5/12) = 25/144.

next, the probability that both chips are red. there are 4 red chips, so the probability of drawing a red chip on the first draw is 4/12, and the same for the second draw. so, the probability that both are red is (4/12) * (4/12) = 16/144.

similarly, for yellow chips, there are 3 yellow chips, so the probability of drawing a yellow chip on each draw is 3/12. therefore, the probability that both chips are yellow is (3/12) * (3/12) = 9/144.

now, to find the probability that both chips are of the same color, i add up these three probabilities: 25/144 + 16/144 + 9/144 = 50/144.

therefore, the probability that the two chips are of different colors is 1 minus the probability that they are the same color. so, 1 - 50/144.

to subtract these, i can think of 1 as 144/144. so, 144/144 - 50/144 = 94/144.

now, i should simplify this fraction. both numerator and denominator are divisible by 2. so, 94 divided by 2 is 47, and 144 divided by 2 is 72. therefore, the probability is 47/72.

wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

first, total chips: 5 + 4 + 3 = 12. that seems correct.

probability both blue: (5/12)*(5/12) = 25/144.

probability both red: (4/12)*(4/12) = 16/144.

probability both yellow: (3/12)*(3/12) = 9/144.

sum of same color probabilities: 25 + 16 + 9 = 50, over 144. that seems right.

probability of different colors: 1 - 50/144 = 94/144, which simplifies to 47/72.

yes, that looks correct.

alternatively, i could calculate the probability of different colors directly by considering all possible pairs of different colors and adding their probabilities.

let's try that to confirm.

first, blue then red: (5/12)*(4/12) = 20/144.

blue then yellow: (5/12)*(3/12) = 15/144.

red then blue: (4/12)*(5/12) = 20/144.

red then yellow: (4/12)*(3/12) = 12/144.

yellow then blue: (3/12)*(5/12) = 15/144.

yellow then red: (3/12)*(4/12) = 12/144.

now, adding all these up: 20 + 15 + 20 + 12 + 15 + 12 = 94/144, which again simplifies to 47/72.

this matches my previous result, so i'm confident that 47/72 is the correct probability.
