Answer: First, we determine the total number of chips in the bag: \(5 + 4 + 3 = 12\).

next, we calculate the probability that both chips drawn are of the same color. 

1. probability both chips are blue:
   \[
   \left(\frac{5}{12}\right) \times \left(\frac{5}{12}\right) = \frac{25}{144}
   \]

2. probability both chips are red:
   \[
   \left(\frac{4}{12}\right) \times \left(\frac{4}{12}\right) = \frac{16}{144}
   \]

3. probability both chips are yellow:
   \[
   \left(\frac{3}{12}\right) \times \left(\frac{3}{12}\right) = \frac{9}{144}
   \]

adding these probabilities gives the probability that both chips are of the same color:
\[
\frac{25}{144} + \frac{16}{144} + \frac{9}{144} = \frac{50}{144}
\]

the probability that the two chips are of different colors is:
\[
1 - \frac{50}{144} = \frac{144}{144} - \frac{50}{144} = \frac{94}{144}
\]

simplifying \(\frac{94}{144}\):
\[
\frac{94 \div 2}{144 \div 2} = \frac{47}{72}
\]

thus, the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{47}{72}}
\]
