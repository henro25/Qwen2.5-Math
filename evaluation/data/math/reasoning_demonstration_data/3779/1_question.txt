Problem: Through a point on the hypotenuse of a right triangle, lines are drawn parallel to the legs of the triangle so that the triangle is divided into a square and two smaller right triangles. The area of one of the two small right triangles is $m$ times the area of the square. What is the ratio of the area of the other small right triangle to the area of the square?  Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $m$.
