Answer: The natural-number factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The sum of their reciprocals is:

\[
\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6}
\]

To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 6:

\[
\frac{6}{6} + \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{12}{6} = 2
\]

Thus, the sum of the reciprocals of the factors of 6 is:

**2**.
