Reasoning: 
Alright, so I've got this problem here: "What is the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6?" Okay, let's break this down. First off, I need to find all the natural-number factors of 6. Natural numbers are the positive integers, right? So, factors of 6 would be the numbers that divide 6 without leaving a remainder.

Let me list them out. 1 times 6 is 6, so 1 and 6 are factors. Then 2 times 3 is also 6, so 2 and 3 are factors. I don't think there are any others because 4 doesn't go into 6 evenly, and neither does 5. So, the factors are 1, 2, 3, and 6.

Now, the problem is asking for the sum of the reciprocals of these factors. So, I need to find 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6. Let me calculate each of these:

1 divided by 1 is 1.

1 divided by 2 is 0.5.

1 divided by 3 is approximately 0.333...

1 divided by 6 is approximately 0.166...

If I add these up: 1 + 0.5 is 1.5, plus 0.333 is about 1.833, plus 0.166 is roughly 2. So, is the sum 2? That seems too neat. Maybe there's a better way to do this without dealing with decimals, which can be a bit messy.

Let me try adding them as fractions. The denominators are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The least common denominator here is 6. So, I'll convert each fraction to have a denominator of 6:

1/1 is the same as 6/6.

1/2 is 3/6.

1/3 is 2/6.

1/6 stays as 1/6.

Now, adding them up: 6/6 + 3/6 + 2/6 + 1/6 equals (6 + 3 + 2 + 1)/6, which is 12/6. And 12 divided by 6 is indeed 2. So, the sum is 2.

Wait a minute, that was much cleaner than dealing with decimals. I should probably stick to fractions for precision, especially in math problems like this.

Just to double-check, are there any other factors of 6 that I might have missed? Let's see, 6 divided by 4 is 1.5, which isn't an integer, and 6 divided by 5 is 1.2, also not an integer. So, no, I didn't miss any factors.

Another way to think about this is to remember that the sum of the reciprocals of the factors of a number is equal to the sum of the factors of that number divided by the number itself. So, sum of reciprocals = (sum of factors) / number.

Let's verify that. The sum of the factors of 6 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 6, which is 12. Then, 12 divided by 6 is 2. Yep, that matches what I got earlier.

I guess this is a useful formula to remember. It might come in handy for similar problems in the future.

So, to sum it all up, the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6 is 2.
