Answer: To find the smallest possible class size, we set the number of students in three rows as \( x \), and the fourth row has \( x + 1 \) students. The total number of students is then:

\[
3x + (x + 1) = 4x + 1
\]

Since the class has over 30 students, we solve the inequality:

\[
4x + 1 > 30
\]

Subtracting 1 from both sides:

\[
4x > 29
\]

Dividing by 4:

\[
x > 7.25
\]

Since \( x \) must be an integer, the smallest possible value for \( x \) is 8. Substituting \( x = 8 \):

- Three rows have 8 students each.
- One row has 9 students.

The total number of students is:

\[
3(8) + 9 = 24 + 9 = 33
\]

Thus, the smallest possible class size is **33** students.
