Reasoning: Alright, so I've got this problem here about students lining up in four rows for a PE class. The class has over 30 students, and three of the rows have the same number of students, while one row has one more student than the others. I need to find the smallest possible class size that fits these conditions.

Okay, let's start by understanding what's being asked. There are four rows in total. Three of them have the same number of students, and one has one more. So, if I let the number of students in the three equal rows be, say, x, then the fourth row would have x + 1 students.

So, the total number of students would be 3 times x plus (x + 1), which is 3x + x + 1 = 4x + 1.

And we know this total has to be more than 30 students. So, 4x + 1 > 30.

I need to solve for x here. Let's see, 4x + 1 > 30.

Subtract 1 from both sides: 4x > 29.

Then, divide both sides by 4: x > 29/4, which is 7.25.

Since the number of students can't be a fraction, x has to be at least 8.

So, if x is 8, then the three rows have 8 students each, and the fourth row has 8 + 1 = 9 students.

Total students would be 3*8 + 9 = 24 + 9 = 33.

Is 33 more than 30? Yes, it is.

Is there a smaller number that works? Well, if x is 7, then the three rows have 7 students each, and the fourth row has 8 students.

Total would be 3*7 + 8 = 21 + 8 = 29.

But 29 is not more than 30, so that doesn't work.

So, 33 seems to be the smallest possible class size that fits all the given conditions.

Wait, but let me double-check. Is there any way to have a smaller total number of students that's still over 30?

If x is 8, total is 33.

If x is 9, total is 3*9 + 10 = 27 + 10 = 37, which is larger than 33.

So, 33 is indeed smaller than 37.

And with x=8, total is 33, which is more than 30.

If I try x=7.5, but that's not possible because you can't have half a student.

So, x has to be an integer.

Therefore, the smallest possible class size is 33 students.
