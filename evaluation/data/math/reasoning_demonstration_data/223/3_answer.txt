Answer: Given the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) that satisfy \( f(g(x)) = x^2 \) and \( g(f(x)) = x^3 \) for all \( x \ge 1 \), and knowing that \( g(16) = 16 \), we need to find \([g(4)]^3\).

first, we use the given \( g(16) = 16 \) in the equation \( f(g(x)) = x^2 \):
\[
f(g(16)) = f(16) = 16^2 = 256 \implies f(16) = 256
\]

next, using \( g(f(x)) = x^3 \) with \( x = 16 \):
\[
g(f(16)) = g(256) = 16^3 = 4096 \implies g(256) = 4096
\]

we then use the relationship derived from the functional equations:
\[
[g(x)]^3 = g(x^2)
\]

setting \( x = 4 \):
\[
[g(4)]^3 = g(16)
\]

given \( g(16) = 16 \):
\[
[g(4)]^3 = 16
\]

thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]
