Answer: To find the remainder when \( x^4 - 7x^3 + 9x^2 + 16x - 13 \) is divided by \( x - 3 \), we can use the remainder theorem. according to the theorem, the remainder is \( f(3) \), where \( f(x) = x^4 - 7x^3 + 9x^2 + 16x - 13 \).

first, we calculate \( f(3) \):

\[
f(3) = 3^4 - 7 \cdot 3^3 + 9 \cdot 3^2 + 16 \cdot 3 - 13
\]

calculating each term step by step:

\[
3^4 = 81
\]
\[
7 \cdot 3^3 = 7 \cdot 27 = 189
\]
\[
9 \cdot 3^2 = 9 \cdot 9 = 81
\]
\[
16 \cdot 3 = 48
\]

now, summing these values:

\[
f(3) = 81 - 189 + 81 + 48 - 13
\]

step-by-step addition:

\[
81 - 189 = -108
\]
\[
-108 + 81 = -27
\]
\[
-27 + 48 = 21
\]
\[
21 - 13 = 8
\]

thus, the remainder is \(\boxed{8}\).
