Reasoning: 
So i've got this problem here: find the remainder when 
x
4
−
7
x
3
+
9
x
2
+
16
x
−
13
x 
4
 −7x 
3
 +9x 
2
 +16x−13 is divided by 
x
−
3
x−3. hmm, i remember something about polynomial division and remainders. maybe i can use the remainder theorem? let me think about that.

okay, the remainder theorem says that if you divide a polynomial 
f
(
x
)
f(x) by 
x
−
a
x−a, the remainder is just 
f
(
a
)
f(a). so in this case, since i'm dividing by 
x
−
3
x−3, i should plug in 
x
=
3
x=3 into the polynomial to find the remainder.

let me write that down: remainder = 
f
(
3
)
f(3), where 
f
(
x
)
=
x
4
−
7
x
3
+
9
x
2
+
16
x
−
13
f(x)=x 
4
 −7x 
3
 +9x 
2
 +16x−13.

alright, let's calculate 
f
(
3
)
f(3):

first, 
x
=
3
x=3, so:

f
(
3
)
=
(
3
)
4
−
7
(
3
)
3
+
9
(
3
)
2
+
16
(
3
)
−
13
f(3)=(3) 
4
 −7(3) 
3
 +9(3) 
2
 +16(3)−13.

now, calculating each term step by step:

(
3
)
4
=
81
(3) 
4
 =81

7
(
3
)
3
=
7
×
27
=
189
7(3) 
3
 =7×27=189

9
(
3
)
2
=
9
×
9
=
81
9(3) 
2
 =9×9=81

16
(
3
)
=
48
16(3)=48

and then there's the constant term, which is -13.

so, putting it all together:

f
(
3
)
=
81
−
189
+
81
+
48
−
13
f(3)=81−189+81+48−13.

now, let's add these up step by step:

first, 
81
−
189
=
−
108
81−189=−108

then, 
−
108
+
81
=
−
27
−108+81=−27

next, 
−
27
+
48
=
21
−27+48=21

finally, 
21
−
13
=
8
21−13=8

so, the remainder should be 8.

wait a minute, is there another way to check this? maybe i can perform polynomial long division to confirm.

let's set that up. dividing 
x
4
−
7
x
3
+
9
x
2
+
16
x
−
13
x 
4
 −7x 
3
 +9x 
2
 +16x−13 by 
x
−
3
x−3.

first, divide 
x
4
x 
4
  by 
x
x, which gives 
x
3
x 
3
 . multiply 
x
3
x 
3
  by 
x
−
3
x−3: 
x
4
−
3
x
3
x 
4
 −3x 
3
 .

subtract that from the original polynomial:

(
x
4
−
7
x
3
+
9
x
2
+
16
x
−
13
)
−
(
x
4
−
3
x
3
)
=
−
4
x
3
+
9
x
2
+
16
x
−
13
(x 
4
 −7x 
3
 +9x 
2
 +16x−13)−(x 
4
 −3x 
3
 )=−4x 
3
 +9x 
2
 +16x−13.

next, divide 
−
4
x
3
−4x 
3
  by 
x
x, which is 
−
4
x
2
−4x 
2
 . multiply 
−
4
x
2
−4x 
2
  by 
x
−
3
x−3: 
−
4
x
3
+
12
x
2
−4x 
3
 +12x 
2
 .

subtract that:

(
−
4
x
3
+
9
x
2
+
16
x
−
13
)
−
(
−
4
x
3
+
12
x
2
)
=
−
3
x
2
+
16
x
−
13
(−4x 
3
 +9x 
2
 +16x−13)−(−4x 
3
 +12x 
2
 )=−3x 
2
 +16x−13.

now, divide 
−
3
x
2
−3x 
2
  by 
x
x, which gives 
−
3
x
−3x. multiply 
−
3
x
−3x by 
x
−
3
x−3: 
−
3
x
2
+
9
x
−3x 
2
 +9x.

subtract:

(
−
3
x
2
+
16
x
−
13
)
−
(
−
3
x
2
+
9
x
)
=
7
x
−
13
(−3x 
2
 +16x−13)−(−3x 
2
 +9x)=7x−13.

next, divide 
7
x
7x by 
x
x, which is 7. multiply 7 by 
x
−
3
x−3: 
7
x
−
21
7x−21.

subtract:

(
7
x
−
13
)
−
(
7
x
−
21
)
=
8
(7x−13)−(7x−21)=8.

so, the remainder is indeed 8. that matches what i got using the remainder theorem. good, i feel confident about this answer now.

i wonder if there's a synthetic division method to do this even quicker. let me try that.

for synthetic division, since we're dividing by 
x
−
3
x−3, we use 3 as the root.

set up the coefficients: 1 (for 
x
4
x 
4
 ), -7 (for 
x
3
x 
3
 ), 9 (for 
x
2
x 
2
 ), 16 (for 
x
x), and -13 (constant term).

bring down the 1.

multiply 1 by 3 to get 3, add to -7 to get -4.

multiply -4 by 3 to get -12, add to 9 to get -3.

multiply -3 by 3 to get -9, add to 16 to get 7.

multiply 7 by 3 to get 21, add to -13 to get 8.

so, the remainder is 8 again. all three methods give me the same answer, which makes me sure that 8 is the correct remainder.

i think i've got it figured out.

**final answer**
