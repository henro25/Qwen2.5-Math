Reasoning: Let's tackle this problem step by step. so, we have two equations:

1. 
x
+
y
=
7
12
x+y= 
12
7
​	
 

2. 
x
−
y
=
1
12
x−y= 
12
1
​	
 

and we need to find 
x
2
−
y
2
x 
2
 −y 
2
 . hmm, i remember that there's a formula for the difference of squares: 
x
2
−
y
2
=
(
x
+
y
)
(
x
−
y
)
x 
2
 −y 
2
 =(x+y)(x−y). oh, that's convenient because we already have expressions for 
x
+
y
x+y and 
x
−
y
x−y. so, maybe i can just plug those in directly.

let me try that:

x
2
−
y
2
=
(
x
+
y
)
(
x
−
y
)
=
(
7
12
)
(
1
12
)
=
7
×
1
12
×
12
=
7
144
x 
2
 −y 
2
 =(x+y)(x−y)=( 
12
7
​	
 )( 
12
1
​	
 )= 
12×12
7×1
​	
 = 
144
7
​	
 

wait, is that all? it seems too straightforward. maybe i should double-check if there's another way to approach this, just to be sure.

alternatively, i could solve for 
x
x and 
y
y individually and then compute 
x
2
−
y
2
x 
2
 −y 
2
 . let's see if that gives the same answer.

starting with the two equations:

1. 
x
+
y
=
7
12
x+y= 
12
7
​	
 

2. 
x
−
y
=
1
12
x−y= 
12
1
​	
 

if i add these two equations together:

(
x
+
y
)
+
(
x
−
y
)
=
7
12
+
1
12
(x+y)+(x−y)= 
12
7
​	
 + 
12
1
​	
 

simplifying:

2
x
=
8
12
2x= 
12
8
​	
 

so,

x
=
8
24
=
1
3
x= 
24
8
​	
 = 
3
1
​	
 

now, substitute 
x
=
1
3
x= 
3
1
​	
  back into one of the original equations to find 
y
y. let's use the first one:

1
3
+
y
=
7
12
3
1
​	
 +y= 
12
7
​	
 

subtract 
1
3
3
1
​	
  from both sides:

y
=
7
12
−
1
3
y= 
12
7
​	
 − 
3
1
​	
 

to subtract these fractions, they need a common denominator. the least common denominator of 12 and 3 is 12.

so,

y
=
7
12
−
4
12
=
3
12
=
1
4
y= 
12
7
​	
 − 
12
4
​	
 = 
12
3
​	
 = 
4
1
​	
 

now, let's compute 
x
2
−
y
2
x 
2
 −y 
2
 :

x
2
=
(
1
3
)
2
=
1
9
x 
2
 =( 
3
1
​	
 ) 
2
 = 
9
1
​	
 

y
2
=
(
1
4
)
2
=
1
16
y 
2
 =( 
4
1
​	
 ) 
2
 = 
16
1
​	
 

so,

x
2
−
y
2
=
1
9
−
1
16
x 
2
 −y 
2
 = 
9
1
​	
 − 
16
1
​	
 

again, find a common denominator, which is 144.

1
9
=
16
144
9
1
​	
 = 
144
16
​	
 

1
16
=
9
144
16
1
​	
 = 
144
9
​	
 

therefore,

x
2
−
y
2
=
16
144
−
9
144
=
7
144
x 
2
 −y 
2
 = 
144
16
​	
 − 
144
9
​	
 = 
144
7
​	
 

okay, so both methods give me 
7
144
144
7
​	
 . that seems consistent. maybe the first method was correct after all, and there's no need for a more complicated approach.

just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem or if there are any potential mistakes i might have made.

one thing i could check is whether i applied the difference of squares formula correctly. the formula is indeed 
x
2
−
y
2
=
(
x
+
y
)
(
x
−
y
)
x 
2
 −y 
2
 =(x+y)(x−y), so that seems right.

also, when solving for 
x
x and 
y
y, i added the two equations correctly and found 
x
=
1
3
x= 
3
1
​	
 , then substituted back to find 
y
=
1
4
y= 
4
1
​	
 . plugging these back into the original equations:

1. 
1
3
+
1
4
=
4
12
+
3
12
=
7
12
3
1
​	
 + 
4
1
​	
 = 
12
4
​	
 + 
12
3
​	
 = 
12
7
​	
  ✔️

2. 
1
3
−
1
4
=
4
12
−
3
12
=
1
12
3
1
​	
 − 
4
1
​	
 = 
12
4
​	
 − 
12
3
​	
 = 
12
1
​	
  ✔️

everything checks out. so, i'm confident that the answer is 
7
144
144
7
​	
 .

**final answer**

7
144
