Reasoning: Let's tackle this problem step by step. so, we have to find the area of the region defined by three conditions: 
x
≥
0
x≥0, 
y
≥
0
y≥0, and 
100
{
x
}
≥
⌊
x
⌋
+
⌊
y
⌋
100{x}≥⌊x⌋+⌊y⌋.

first, i need to understand what each part of this inequality means. i know that 
⌊
x
⌋
⌊x⌋ is the greatest integer less than or equal to 
x
x, and 
{
x
}
=
x
−
⌊
x
⌋
{x}=x−⌊x⌋ is the fractional part of 
x
x. so, 
{
x
}
{x} is always between 0 and 1, right?

given that, the inequality 
100
{
x
}
≥
⌊
x
⌋
+
⌊
y
⌋
100{x}≥⌊x⌋+⌊y⌋ seems to relate the fractional part of 
x
x to the integer parts of both 
x
x and 
y
y. since 
{
x
}
{x} is less than 1, multiplying it by 100 scales it up to a value between 0 and 100. so, the inequality is saying that this scaled fractional part is at least as big as the sum of the integer parts of 
x
x and 
y
y.

i think it would be helpful to consider 
x
x and 
y
y in terms of their integer and fractional parts. let's denote:

x
=
m
+
α
,
where 
m
=
⌊
x
⌋
 and 
0
≤
α
<
1
,
x=m+α,where m=⌊x⌋ and 0≤α<1,
y
=
n
+
β
,
where 
n
=
⌊
y
⌋
 and 
0
≤
β
<
1.
y=n+β,where n=⌊y⌋ and 0≤β<1.
so, substituting these into the inequality:

100
α
≥
m
+
n
.
100α≥m+n.
our goal is to find the area in the 
x
y
xy-plane where this holds, with 
x
≥
0
x≥0 and 
y
≥
0
y≥0.

since 
m
m and 
n
n are non-negative integers (because 
x
,
y
≥
0
x,y≥0), and 
α
,
β
α,β are in [0,1), for each pair 
(
m
,
n
)
(m,n), we can find the range of 
α
α and 
β
β that satisfy the inequality.

let's fix 
m
m and 
n
n, and see what 
α
α must satisfy:

100
α
≥
m
+
n
  
⟹
  
α
≥
m
+
n
100
.
100α≥m+n⟹α≥ 
100
m+n
​
 .
but since 
α
<
1
α<1, the condition becomes:

m
+
n
100
≤
α
<
1.
100
m+n
​
 ≤α<1.
additionally, since 
α
≥
0
α≥0, we need to consider cases where 
m
+
n
100
≤
1
100
m+n
​
 ≤1, which is always true because 
m
m and 
n
n are non-negative integers, and 
m
+
n
≤
100
m+n≤100 would naturally hold for the inequality to have solutions.

wait, actually, if 
m
+
n
>
100
m+n>100, then 
m
+
n
100
>
1
100
m+n
​
 >1, but since 
α
<
1
α<1, there would be no solution in that case. so, we need 
m
+
n
≤
100
m+n≤100 for there to be any 
α
α satisfying the inequality.

therefore, for each pair 
(
m
,
n
)
(m,n) where 
m
m and 
n
n are non-negative integers and 
m
+
n
≤
100
m+n≤100, the corresponding region in 
α
α and 
β
β is:

α
∈
[
m
+
n
100
,
1
)
,
β
∈
[
0
,
1
)
.
α∈[ 
100
m+n
​
 ,1),β∈[0,1).
since 
β
β can be anything in [0,1), the area for each 
(
m
,
n
)
(m,n) pair is the length of the 
α
α interval times the length of the 
β
β interval. that is:

area for 
(
m
,
n
)
=
(
1
−
m
+
n
100
)
×
1
=
1
−
m
+
n
100
.
area for (m,n)=(1− 
100
m+n
​
 )×1=1− 
100
m+n
​
 .
now, since each 
m
m and 
n
n correspond to a unit square in the 
x
y
xy-plane (since 
x
x and 
y
y are partitioned into integer and fractional parts), the total area is the sum of these areas over all valid 
(
m
,
n
)
(m,n) pairs.

so, the total area 
a
a is:

a
=
∑
m
=
0
100
∑
n
=
0
100
−
m
(
1
−
m
+
n
100
)
.
a= 
m=0
∑
100
​
  
n=0
∑
100−m
​
 (1− 
100
m+n
​
 ).
wait, but actually, 
m
m can be from 0 to infinity in principle, but since 
m
+
n
≤
100
m+n≤100, for each 
m
m, 
n
n can go up to 
100
−
m
100−m. however, both 
m
m and 
n
n are non-negative integers, so 
m
m can range from 0 to 100, and for each 
m
m, 
n
n can range from 0 to 
100
−
m
100−m.

but actually, 
m
m can be any non-negative integer, but if 
m
>
100
m>100, then 
n
n would have to be negative to satisfy 
m
+
n
≤
100
m+n≤100, which isn't possible since 
n
≥
0
n≥0. so, 
m
m indeed ranges from 0 to 100.

now, to compute the double sum:

a
=
∑
m
=
0
100
∑
n
=
0
100
−
m
(
1
−
m
+
n
100
)
.
a= 
m=0
∑
100
​
  
n=0
∑
100−m
​
 (1− 
100
m+n
​
 ).
this seems a bit complicated. maybe there's a smarter way to compute this sum.

let's try to simplify the expression inside the sum:

1
−
m
+
n
100
=
100
−
m
−
n
100
.
1− 
100
m+n
​
 = 
100
100−m−n
​
 .
so, the area becomes:

a
=
∑
m
=
0
100
∑
n
=
0
100
−
m
100
−
m
−
n
100
=
1
100
∑
m
=
0
100
∑
n
=
0
100
−
m
(
100
−
m
−
n
)
.
a= 
m=0
∑
100
​
  
n=0
∑
100−m
​
  
100
100−m−n
​
 = 
100
1
​
  
m=0
∑
100
​
  
n=0
∑
100−m
​
 (100−m−n).
now, let's make a substitution to simplify the inner sum. let 
k
=
100
−
m
−
n
k=100−m−n, which means 
n
=
100
−
m
−
k
n=100−m−k. when 
n
=
0
n=0, 
k
=
100
−
m
k=100−m, and when 
n
=
100
−
m
n=100−m, 
k
=
0
k=0. so, 
k
k ranges from 0 to 
100
−
m
100−m.

but i'm not sure if this substitution helps directly. maybe there's a better way.

alternatively, notice that 
100
−
m
−
n
100−m−n is just the remaining value after assigning 
m
m and 
n
n from 0 up to 100. this seems reminiscent of stars and bars in combinatorics, where we distribute a certain number among variables.

wait a minute, perhaps i can think of 
m
+
n
+
k
=
100
m+n+k=100, where 
k
=
100
−
m
−
n
k=100−m−n, and 
k
≥
0
k≥0. but i'm not sure if that helps directly here.

let me try to compute the inner sum first:

∑
n
=
0
100
−
m
(
100
−
m
−
n
)
=
∑
n
=
0
100
−
m
k
where 
k
=
100
−
m
−
n
.
n=0
∑
100−m
​
 (100−m−n)= 
n=0
∑
100−m
​
 kwhere k=100−m−n.
this is equivalent to summing 
k
k from 
k
=
0
k=0 to 
k
=
100
−
m
k=100−m, which is:

∑
k
=
0
100
−
m
k
=
(
100
−
m
)
(
100
−
m
+
1
)
2
.
k=0
∑
100−m
​
 k= 
2
(100−m)(100−m+1)
​
 .
so, the area becomes:

a
=
1
100
∑
m
=
0
100
(
100
−
m
)
(
101
−
m
)
2
=
1
200
∑
m
=
0
100
(
100
−
m
)
(
101
−
m
)
.
a= 
100
1
​
  
m=0
∑
100
​
  
2
(100−m)(101−m)
​
 = 
200
1
​
  
m=0
∑
100
​
 (100−m)(101−m).
now, let's make a substitution to simplify the sum. let 
m
′
=
100
−
m
m 
′
 =100−m, so when 
m
=
0
m=0, 
m
′
=
100
m 
′
 =100, and when 
m
=
100
m=100, 
m
′
=
0
m 
′
 =0. so, 
m
′
m 
′
  ranges from 0 to 100.

substituting:

a
=
1
200
∑
m
′
=
0
100
m
′
(
m
′
+
1
)
=
1
200
∑
m
′
=
0
100
(
m
′
2
+
m
′
)
.
a= 
200
1
​
  
m 
′
 =0
∑
100
​
 m

 (m

200
1
​
  
m 
′
 =0
∑
100
​
 (m 
′2
 +m 
′
 ).
now, we can split the sum:

a
=
1
200
(
∑
m
′
=
0
100
m
′
2
+
∑
m

)
.
a=

∑
100
​
 m

 + 
m

 =0
∑
100
​
 m

 ).
i recall the formulas for these sums:

∑

 ,

 .
plugging in

∑

let me compute that:

​
 =338,350.
so, plugging back into the expression for

a:

​
 (338,350+5,050)=

wait, that seems too large. let me check my calculations.

first, the sum of squares:

 .
calculating step by step:

100
÷

but actually, it's better to compute it as:

​
 =

100
​
 ×101×201=

​
 ×101×201.
hmm, perhaps there's a better way to compute this.

alternatively, note that:

∑

=

100
m

2
=
∑
m

=

100

=

,
m

∑
100
​
 m

 = 
m

 =1
∑
100
​
 m

 = 
6
100×101×201
​
 =338,350,
and

∑
m

100
m

m 
′
 =0
∑
100
​
 m 
′
 = 
2
100×101
​
 =5,050.
so, indeed, the sum is 
338
,
350
+
5
,
050
=
343
,
400
338,350+5,050=343,400, and dividing by 200 gives:

a
=
343
,
400
200
=
1
,
717.
a= 
200
343,400
​
 =1,717.
but this seems too large for an area defined by these constraints. maybe i made a mistake in setting up the sums.

let me double-check the earlier steps. the area for each 
(
m
,
n
)
(m,n) pair is 
1
−
m
+
n
100
1− 
100
m+n
​
 , and this needs to be summed over all 
m
,
n
m,n with 
m
+
n
≤
100
m+n≤100.

alternatively, perhaps there's a geometric interpretation that can simplify this calculation.

let's consider the 
(
m
,
n
)
(m,n) grid where 
m
m and 
n
n are non-negative integers, and 
m
+
n
≤
100
m+n≤100. this forms a triangular grid with vertices at 
(
0
,
0
)
(0,0), 
(
100
,
0
)
(100,0), and 
(
0
,
100
)
(0,100).

for each such 
(
m
,
n
)
(m,n), the corresponding area is 
1
−
m
+
n
100
1− 
100
m+n
​
 , which is the height of a rectangle with base 1 in the 
α
β
αβ-plane.

alternatively, perhaps i can interpret this area in terms of integration.

let me try to visualize this. for each unit square in the 
(
m
,
n
)
(m,n) grid, the area contribution is 
1
−
m
+
n
100
1− 
100
m+n
​
 .

wait, maybe it's easier to consider integrating over 
x
x and 
y
y, but considering their integer and fractional parts is complicating things.

let me try a different approach.

since 
x
=
m
+
α
x=m+α and 
y
=
n
+
β
y=n+β, with 
m
,
n
m,n integers and 
α
,
β
α,β in [0,1), the condition 
100
α
≥
m
+
n
100α≥m+n can be rewritten as:

α
≥
m
+
n
100
.
α≥ 
100
m+n
​
 .
now, for each fixed 
m
m and 
n
n, 
α
α must be at least 
m
+
n
100
100
m+n
​
 , but since 
α
<
1
α<1, this is only possible if 
m
+
n
100
<
1
100
m+n
​
 <1, i.e., 
m
+
n
<
100
m+n<100.

wait, but earlier i considered 
m
+
n
≤
100
m+n≤100, but actually, 
α
<
1
α<1, so 
m
+
n
100
≤
1
100
m+n
​
 ≤1, meaning 
m
+
n
≤
100
m+n≤100. however, if 
m
+
n
=
100
m+n=100, then 
α
≥
1
α≥1, which is impossible since 
α
<
1
α<1. therefore, 
m
+
n
m+n must be less than 100.

so, 
m
+
n
≤
99
m+n≤99.

wait, but if 
m
+
n
=
100
m+n=100, then 
α
≥
1
α≥1, which is not possible because 
α
<
1
α<1. so, the condition 
m
+
n
≤
99
m+n≤99.

therefore, the valid pairs 
(
m
,
n
)
(m,n) are those with 
m
+
n
≤
99
m+n≤99.

for each such pair, the area is 
1
−
m
+
n
100
1− 
100
m+n
​
 .

therefore, the total area is:

a
=
∑
m
=
0
99
∑
n
=
0
99
−
m
(
1
−
m
+
n

)
.
a= 
m=0
∑
99
​
  
n=0
∑
99−m
​
 (1− 
100
m+n
​
 ).
now, to compute this double sum, let's try to simplify it.

first, note that:

1
−
m
+
n
100
=
100
−
m
−
n
100
.
1− 
100
m+n
​
 = 
100
100−m−n
​
 .
so,

a
=
∑
m
=
0
99
∑
n
=
0
99
−
m
100
−
m
−
n
100
=
1
100
∑
m
=
0
99
∑
n
=
0
99
−
m
(
100
−
m
−
n
)
.
a= 
m=0
∑
99
​
  
n=0
∑
99−m
​
  
100
100−m−n
​
 = 
100
1
​
  
m=0
∑
99
​
  
n=0
∑
99−m
​
 (100−m−n).
now, let's consider the inner sum:

∑
n
=
0
99
−
m
(
100
−
m
−
n
)
=
∑
n
=
0
99
−
m
(
100
−
m
−
n
)
.
n=0
∑
99−m
​
 (100−m−n)= 
n=0
∑
99−m
​
 (100−m−n).
let’s make a substitution: let 
k
=
100
−
m
−
n
k=100−m−n, then 
n
=
100
−
m
−
k
n=100−m−k. when 
n
=
0
n=0, 
k
=
100
−
m
k=100−m, and when 
n
=
99
−
m
n=99−m, 
k
=
100
−
m
−
(
99
−
m
)
=
100
−
m
−
99
+
m
=
1
k=100−m−(99−m)=100−m−99+m=1. so, 
k
k ranges from 1 to 
100
−
m
100−m.

therefore, the inner sum becomes:

∑
k
=
1
100
−
m
k
=
(
100
−
m
)
(
101
−
m
)
2
.
k=1
∑
100−m
​
 k= 
2
(100−m)(101−m)
​
 .
thus, the total area is:

a
=
1
100
∑
m
=
0
99
(
100
−
m
)
(
101
−
m
)
2
=
1
200
∑
m
=
0
99
(
100
−
m
)
(
101
−
m
)
.
a= 
100
1
​
  
m=0
∑
99
​
  
2
(100−m)(101−m)
​
 = 
200
1
​
  
m=0
∑
99
​
 (100−m)(101−m).
let’s make a substitution to simplify the sum. let 
m
′
=
100
−
m
m 
′
 =100−m, then when 
m
=
0
m=0, 
m
′
=
100
m 
′
 =100, and when 
m
=
99
m=99, 
m
′
=
1
m 
′
 =1. so, 
m
′
m 
′
  ranges from 1 to 100.

substituting:

a
=
1
200
∑
m
′
=
1
100
m
′
(
m
′
+
1
)
=
1
200
∑
m
′
=
1
100
(
m
′
2
+
m
′
)
.
a= 
200
1
​
  
m 
′
 =1
∑
100
​
 m 
′
 (m 
′
 +1)= 
200
1
​
  
m 
′
 =1
∑
100
​
 (m 
′2
 +m 
′
 ).
now, split the sum:

a
=
1
200
(
∑
m
′
=
1
100
m
′
2
+
∑
m
′
=
1
100
m
′
)
.
a= 
200
1
​
 ( 
m

 =1
∑
100
​
 m 
′2
 + 
m 
′
 =1
∑
100
​
 m 
′
 ).
using the formulas for the sum of squares and the sum of the first 
n
n positive integers:

∑
m

=
1
100
m
′
2
=
100

201

=

m

∑

 =

​
 =338,350,
∑

m

 =1
∑
100
​
 m

​
 =5,050.
therefore:

a

)
=

a=

​
 (338,350+5,050)=

​
 ×343,400=1,717.
hmm, this seems quite large for an area defined by 
x
x and 
y
y starting from 0 and bounded by the condition 
100
{
x
}
≥
⌊
x
⌋
+
⌊
y
⌋
100{x}≥⌊x⌋+⌊y⌋. maybe i need to check if the approach is correct.

let me consider the possible maximum values. since 
⌊
x
⌋
⌊x⌋ and 
⌊
y
⌋
⌊y⌋ are non-negative integers, and 
100
{
x
}
100{x} is less than 100, the sum 
⌊
x
⌋
+
⌊
y
⌋
⌊x⌋+⌊y⌋ must be less than 100 for there to be any 
x
x and 
y
y satisfying the inequality.

therefore, the condition 
100
{
x
}
≥
⌊
x
⌋
+
⌊
y
⌋
100{x}≥⌊x⌋+⌊y⌋ implies that 
⌊
x
⌋
+
⌊
y
⌋
<
100
⌊x⌋+⌊y⌋<100, since 
100
{
x
}
<
100
100{x}<100.

wait a minute, earlier i thought 
m
+
n
≤
99
m+n≤99, but actually, since 
{
x
}
<
1
{x}<1, 
100
{
x
}
<
100
100{x}<100, so 
m
+
n
<
100
m+n<100, which includes 
m
+
n
=
99
m+n=99 but not 
m
+
n
=
100
m+n=100.

so, the range for 
m
m and 
n
n is 
m
,
n
≥
0
m,n≥0, integers, and 
m
+
n
≤
99
m+n≤99.

thus, the sum should indeed be over 
m
=
0
m=0 to 
99
99, and for each 
m
m, 
n
=
0
n=0 to 
99
−
m
99−m.

but my calculation led to an area of 1,717, which seems too large. maybe i need to reconsider the units.

each unit square in the 
(
m
,
n
)
(m,n) grid corresponds to a unit square in the 
(
x
,
y
)
(x,y) plane, but within each unit square, the area where the condition holds is 
1
−
m
+
n
100
1− 
100
m+n
​
 . so, the total area should be the sum over all such unit squares of 
1
−
m
+
n
100
1− 
100
m+n
​
 .

alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to visualize this region.

let me try to think geometrically. the condition 
100
{
x
}
≥
⌊
x
⌋
+
⌊
y
⌋
100{x}≥⌊x⌋+⌊y⌋ can be rewritten in terms of 
x
x and 
y
y:

100
(
x
−
⌊
x
⌋
)
≥
⌊
x
⌋
+
⌊
y
⌋
.
100(x−⌊x⌋)≥⌊x⌋+⌊y⌋.
this simplifies to:

100
x
−
100
⌊
x
⌋
≥
⌊
x
⌋
+
⌊
y
⌋
.
100x−100⌊x⌋≥⌊x⌋+⌊y⌋.
rearranging:

100
x
≥
⌊
x
⌋
+
⌊
y
⌋
+
100
⌊
x
⌋
=
(
100
+
1
)
⌊
x
⌋
+
⌊
y
⌋
.
100x≥⌊x⌋+⌊y⌋+100⌊x⌋=(100+1)⌊x⌋+⌊y⌋.
wait, that doesn't seem helpful. maybe another approach.

let me consider that for each integer 
m
=
⌊
x
⌋
m=⌊x⌋ and 
n
=
⌊
y
⌋
n=⌊y⌋, the fractional parts 
α
=
x
−
m
α=x−m and 
β
=
y
−
n
β=y−n must satisfy:

100
α
≥
m
+
n
.
100α≥m+n.
since 
α
α is in [0,1), this implies:

α
≥
m
+
n
100
.
α≥ 
100
m+n
​
 .
also, since 
α
<
1
α<1, we have:

m
+
n
100
≤
α
<
1.
100
m+n
​
 ≤α<1.
but for 
α
α to be in this range, we need:

m
+
n
100
<
1
  
⟹
  
m
+
n
<
100.
100
m+n
​
 <1⟹m+n<100.
therefore, 
m
+
n
≤
99
m+n≤99.

now, within each unit square defined by 
m
m and 
n
n, the area where 
α
≥
m
+
n
100
α≥ 
100
m+n
​
  is:

1
−
m
+
n
100
.
1− 
100
m+n
​
 .
therefore, the total area is:

a
=
∑
m
=
0
99
∑
n
=
0
99
−
m
(
1
−
m

n
100
)
.
a= 
m=0
∑
99
​
  
n=0
∑
99−m
​
 (1− 
100
m+n
​
 ).
this matches what i had earlier.

alternatively, perhaps i can switch the order of summation or find a closed-form expression for this double sum.

let me try to compute the inner sum first:

∑
n
=
0
99

∑

​
 1−

∑

​

this simplifies to:

therefore:

so, the inner sum becomes:

this is the same expression i had earlier.

a= 
200

​
 =1,717.
this seems consistent with my earlier calculation, but as i mentioned, it feels quite large for the given constraints. maybe i need to think about this differently.

let me consider the integral over 
x
x and 
y
y. since 
x
x and 
y
y are both non-negative, and we're dealing with their integer and fractional parts, perhaps integrating directly might be more straightforward.

expressed in terms of 
x
x and 
y
y, the condition is:

100
{
x
}
≥
⌊
x
⌋
+
⌊
y
⌋
.
100{x}≥⌊x⌋+⌊y⌋.
let me consider 
x
x and 
y
y in the intervals 
[
k
,
k
+
1
)
[k,k+1) and 
[
l
,
l
+
1
)
[l,l+1) respectively, where 
k
k and 
l
l are non-negative integers.

in this case:

⌊
x
⌋
=
k
,
{
x
}
=
x
−
k
,
⌊x⌋=k,{x}=x−k,
⌊
y
⌋
=
l
,
{
y
}
=
y
−
l
.
⌊y⌋=l,{y}=y−l.
so, the condition becomes:

100
(
x
−
k
)
≥
k
+
l
  
⟹
  
100
x
−
100
k
≥
k
+
l
  
⟹
  
100
x
≥
101
k
+
l
.
100(x−k)≥k+l⟹100x−100k≥k+l⟹100x≥101k+l.
since 
x
∈
[
k
,
k
+
1
)
x∈[k,k+1), 
x
=
k
+
α
x=k+α, where 
0
≤
α
<
1
0≤α<1, so:

100
(
k
+
α
)
≥
101
k
+
l
  
⟹
  
100
k
+
100
α
≥
101
k
+
l
  
⟹
  
100
α
≥
k
+
l
.
100(k+α)≥101k+l⟹100k+100α≥101k+l⟹100α≥k+l.
this matches the earlier condition 
100
α
≥
m
+
n
100α≥m+n, where 
m
=
k
m=k and 
n
=
l
n=l.

now, considering 
x
x and 
y
y in their respective intervals, the area in each 
[
k
,
k
+
1
)
×
[
l
,
l
+
1
)
[k,k+1)×[l,l+1) square where the condition holds is:

area
=
length in 
x
 where 
100
α
≥
k
+
l
×
1
=
(
1
−
k
+
l
100
)
×
1
,
area=length in x where 100α≥k+l×1=(1− 
100
k+l
​
 )×1,
provided that 
k
+
l
100
≤
1
100
k+l
​
 ≤1, which is equivalent to 
k
+
l
≤
99
k+l≤99.

therefore, the total area is indeed:

a
=
∑
k
=
0
99
∑
l
=
0
99
−
k
(
1
−
k
+
l
100
)
.
a= 
k=0
∑
99
​
  
l=0
∑
99−k
​
 (1− 
100
k+l
​
 ).
this seems to confirm my earlier approach. perhaps the area is indeed 1,717, and my intuition about it being too large is misplaced.

alternatively, maybe there's a way to interpret this sum geometrically to find a closed-form expression without summing term by term.

let me consider the sum:

a
=
∑
k
=
0
99
∑
l
=
0
99
−
k
(
1
−
k
+
l
100
)
.
a= 
k=0
∑
99
​
  
l=0
∑
99−k
​
 (1− 
100
k+l
​
 ).
this can be interpreted as the sum over all pairs 
(
k
,
l
)
(k,l) with 
k
+
l
≤
99
k+l≤99 of the area 
1
−
k
+
l
100
1− 
100
k+l
​
 .

alternatively, maybe i can think of this as an integral over a polygon.

consider the region in the 
(
k
,
l
)
(k,l) plane where 
k
,
l
≥
0
k,l≥0 and 
k
+
l
≤
99
k+l≤99. this is a right triangle with vertices at 
(
0
,
0
)
(0,0), 
(
99
,
0
)
(99,0), and 
(
0
,
99
)
(0,99).

within this triangle, for each integer point 
(
k
,
l
)
(k,l), the area contribution is 
1
−
k
+
l
100
1− 
100
k+l
​
 .

this seems complicated to integrate directly, but perhaps i can approximate it or find a pattern.

alternatively, maybe i can consider generating functions or other advanced techniques, but that might be overkill for this problem.

given that my earlier calculation led to 
a
=
1
,
717
a=1,717, and considering that for each unit square where 
k
+
l
≤
99
k+l≤99, the area contribution decreases linearly with 
k
+
l
k+l, this might indeed be the correct result.

to verify, let's consider a smaller case, say 
k
+
l
≤
2
k+l≤2, and compute the area manually.

for 
k
=
0
k=0:

- 
l
=
0
l=0: 
1
−
0
+
0
100
=
1
1− 
100
0+0
​
 =1

- 
l
=
1
l=1: 
1
−
0
+
1
100
=
0.99
1− 
100
0+1
​
 =0.99

- 
l
=
2
l=2: 
1
−
0
+
2
100
=
0.98
1− 
100
0+2
​
 =0.98

for 
k
=
1
k=1:

- 
l
=
0
l=0: 
1
−
1
+
0
100
=
0.99
1− 
100
1+0
​
 =0.99

- 
l
=
1
l=1: 
1
−
1
+
1
100
=
0.98
1− 
100
1+1
​
 =0.98

for 
k
=
2
k=2:

- 
l
=
0
l=0: 
1
−
2
+
0
100
=
0.98
1− 
100
2+0
​
 =0.98

so, total area for this small case:

1
+
0.99
+
0.98
+
0.99
+
0.98
+
0.98
=
5.92.
1+0.99+0.98+0.99+0.98+0.98=5.92.
but if i use the formula:

a
=
1
200
∑
k
=
0
2
∑
l
=
0
2
−
k
(
100
−
k
−
l
)
(
101
−
k
−
l
)
.
a= 
200
1
​
  
k=0
∑
2
​
  
l=0
∑
2−k
​
 (100−k−l)(101−k−l).
wait, perhaps this isn't the best way to verify. maybe instead, i can compute the sum for this small case directly.

alternatively, perhaps i should accept that the area is indeed 1,717 based on the calculations, unless there's a clear error in the approach.

therefore, the area of the region described is 
1717
1717
​
 .

**final answer**

1717
