Reasoning: So i need to find a quadratic polynomial p(x) that satisfies three conditions: p(-2) = 13, p(1) = -2, and p(3) = 8. quadratic polynomials have the general form p(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, and c are constants that i need to determine.

first, since it's a quadratic polynomial, it should have exactly three coefficients: a, b, and c. i have three points given, so i can set up three equations based on these points and solve for a, b, and c.

let's plug in the points one by one.

1. for p(-2) = 13:

p(-2) = a*(-2)² + b*(-2) + c = 13

simplify: 4a - 2b + c = 13

2. for p(1) = -2:

p(1) = a*(1)² + b*(1) + c = -2

simplify: a + b + c = -2

3. for p(3) = 8:

p(3) = a*(3)² + b*(3) + c = 8

simplify: 9a + 3b + c = 8

now, i have a system of three equations:

1. 4a - 2b + c = 13

2. a + b + c = -2

3. 9a + 3b + c = 8

i need to solve this system for a, b, and c. i can use substitution or elimination. i'll try elimination.

first, let's subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate c:

(4a - 2b + c) - (a + b + c) = 13 - (-2)

4a - 2b + c - a - b - c = 15

3a - 3b = 15

simplify: a - b = 5  → equation 4

next, subtract equation 2 from equation 3:

(9a + 3b + c) - (a + b + c) = 8 - (-2)

9a + 3b + c - a - b - c = 10

8a + 2b = 10

simplify: 4a + b = 5  → equation 5

now, i have two equations:

4. a - b = 5

5. 4a + b = 5

i can add these two equations to eliminate b:

(a - b) + (4a + b) = 5 + 5

a - b + 4a + b = 10

5a = 10

so, a = 2

now, plug a = 2 into equation 4:

2 - b = 5

-b = 3

b = -3

now, plug a = 2 and b = -3 into equation 2 to find c:

2 + (-3) + c = -2

-1 + c = -2

c = -1

so, the coefficients are a = 2, b = -3, and c = -1.

therefore, the quadratic polynomial is p(x) = 2x² - 3x - 1.

wait a minute, i should check if this actually satisfies all three points.

let's verify:

1. p(-2) = 2*(-2)² - 3*(-2) - 1 = 2*4 + 6 - 1 = 8 + 6 - 1 = 13 ✓

2. p(1) = 2*(1)² - 3*(1) - 1 = 2 - 3 - 1 = -2 ✓

3. p(3) = 2*(3)² - 3*(3) - 1 = 2*9 - 9 - 1 = 18 - 9 - 1 = 8 ✓

all points satisfy the polynomial, so i think this is correct.

**final answer**
