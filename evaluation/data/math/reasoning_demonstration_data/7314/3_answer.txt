Answer: To find the quadratic polynomial \( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \) that satisfies the conditions \( p(-2) = 13 \), \( p(1) = -2 \), and \( p(3) = 8 \), we set up the following system of equations:

1. \( 4a - 2b + c = 13 \)
2. \( a + b + c = -2 \)
3. \( 9a + 3b + c = 8 \)

first, we subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate \( c \):

\[
(4a - 2b + c) - (a + b + c) = 13 - (-2)
\]
\[
4a - 2b + c - a - b - c = 15
\]
\[
3a - 3b = 15
\]
\[
a - b = 5 \quad \text{(equation 4)}
\]

next, we subtract equation 2 from equation 3 to eliminate \( c \):

\[
(9a + 3b + c) - (a + b + c) = 8 - (-2)
\]
\[
9a + 3b + c - a - b - c = 10
\]
\[
8a + 2b = 10
\]
\[
4a + b = 5 \quad \text{(equation 5)}
\]

we now solve the system of equations 4 and 5:

\[
a - b = 5
\]
\[
4a + b = 5
\]

adding these two equations to eliminate \( b \):

\[
(a - b) + (4a + b) = 5 + 5
\]
\[
a - b + 4a + b = 10
\]
\[
5a = 10
\]
\[
a = 2
\]

substituting \( a = 2 \) into equation 4:

\[
2 - b = 5
\]
\[
-b = 3
\]
\[
b = -3
\]

finally, substituting \( a = 2 \) and \( b = -3 \) into equation 2 to find \( c \):

\[
2 + (-3) + c = -2
\]
\[
-1 + c = -2
\]
\[
c = -1
\]

thus, the quadratic polynomial is:

\[
p(x) = 2x^2 - 3x - 1
\]

verifying the polynomial with the given points:

1. \( p(-2) = 2(-2)^2 - 3(-2) - 1 = 8 + 6 - 1 = 13 \)
2. \( p(1) = 2(1)^2 - 3(1) - 1 = 2 - 3 - 1 = -2 \)
3. \( p(3) = 2(3)^2 - 3(3) - 1 = 18 - 9 - 1 = 8 \)

all points satisfy the polynomial, so the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{2x^2 - 3x - 1}
\]
