Reasoning: Let's tackle this problem step by step. so, we have this expression: √5 + 1/√5 + √7 + 1/√7, and we need to write it in the form (a√5 + b√7)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers, and c is as small as possible. then, we need to find a + b + c.

first, i want to understand the expression better. it has square roots and their reciprocals. maybe i can simplify each pair separately.

let's look at √5 + 1/√5. hmm, can i combine these terms? well, √5 is the same as (√5)/1, and 1/√5 is already in that form. maybe i can find a common denominator to add them.

the common denominator for √5 and 1/√5 would be √5. so, √5 = (√5 * √5)/√5 = 5/√5. wait, no, that's not right. if i have √5 + 1/√5, to add them, i need a common denominator, which would be √5.

so, √5 = (√5 * √5)/√5 = 5/√5.

therefore, √5 + 1/√5 = 5/√5 + 1/√5 = (5 + 1)/√5 = 6/√5.

similarly, for √7 + 1/√7, the same logic applies.

√7 + 1/√7 = (√7 * √7)/√7 + 1/√7 = 7/√7 + 1/√7 = (7 + 1)/√7 = 8/√7.

wait, that seems off. let me check that again.

actually, √7 * √7 is 7, so √7 = 7/√7? no, that doesn't make sense. wait, √7 is √7, and 1/√7 is 1/√7. to add them, i need a common denominator, which is √7.

so, √7 = (√7 * √7)/√7 = 7/√7.

therefore, √7 + 1/√7 = 7/√7 + 1/√7 = (7 + 1)/√7 = 8/√7.

okay, that makes sense.

so now, the original expression is √5 + 1/√5 + √7 + 1/√7 = 6/√5 + 8/√7.

but the problem wants it in the form (a√5 + b√7)/c.

so, i have 6/√5 + 8/√7, and i need to combine these into a single fraction with radicals in the numerator.

one way to do this is to rationalize the denominators first.

let's rationalize 6/√5.

6/√5 = 6√5 / (√5 * √5) = 6√5 / 5.

similarly, 8/√7 = 8√7 / 7.

so, now the expression is 6√5 / 5 + 8√7 / 7.

to combine these into a single fraction, i need a common denominator.

the denominators are 5 and 7, so the least common multiple is 35.

so, 6√5 / 5 = (6√5 * 7) / 35 = 42√5 / 35.

and 8√7 / 7 = (8√7 * 5) / 35 = 40√7 / 35.

now, adding them together: 42√5 / 35 + 40√7 / 35 = (42√5 + 40√7) / 35.

so, this is in the form (a√5 + b√7)/c, where a = 42, b = 40, c = 35.

but the problem says to make c as small as possible.

is there a way to reduce this fraction further?

let's see if 42, 40, and 35 have a common factor.

42 and 35 are both divisible by 7: 42 ÷ 7 = 6, 35 ÷ 7 = 5.

40 ÷ 7 is not an integer, so 7 is not a common factor for all three.

wait, 40 is divisible by 5: 40 ÷ 5 = 8, and 35 ÷ 5 = 7, but 42 ÷ 5 is not an integer. so, 5 is not a common factor for all three.

is there any other common factor?

let's check 2: 42 ÷ 2 = 21, 40 ÷ 2 = 20, 35 ÷ 2 is not an integer.

next, 1: obviously, but that doesn't help reduce the fraction.

so, it seems that 35 is already the smallest possible denominator for c.

therefore, a = 42, b = 40, c = 35.

so, a + b + c = 42 + 40 + 35 = 117.

but wait a minute, the problem says "c is as small as possible." is there a way to make c smaller?

let me think differently. maybe there's a better way to approach this from the beginning.

original expression: √5 + 1/√5 + √7 + 1/√7.

maybe instead of combining √5 + 1/√5 and √7 + 1/√7 separately, i can find a common expression or factor.

alternatively, perhaps i can write the entire expression over a common denominator right from the start.

let me try that.

first, write all terms with denominator √5 * √7, but that seems complicated.

alternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of √5 and √7.

wait, maybe i can factor out √5 and √7.

but that might not be straightforward.

alternatively, perhaps consider multiplying numerator and denominator by something to rationalize.

wait, but i already have denominators rationalized in the previous approach.

alternatively, perhaps i can look for a common expression.

wait, maybe i can think about the expression as:

√5 + 1/√5 + √7 + 1/√7 = (√5 + √7) + (1/√5 + 1/√7).

is there a way to combine these terms in a different way?

alternatively, perhaps consider that √5 + 1/√5 is equal to (√5)^2 + 1 / √5 = 5 + 1 / √5, but that seems like i'm going backwards.

wait, no, √5 + 1/√5 is equal to (√5)^2 + 1 / √5, but that's not helpful.

let me try another approach.

suppose i set the entire expression equal to (a√5 + b√7)/c, and then solve for a, b, c.

so, √5 + 1/√5 + √7 + 1/√7 = (a√5 + b√7)/c.

i need to find integers a, b, c such that this equality holds, and c is minimized.

maybe i can express the left side in terms of √5 and √7 and then equate coefficients.

first, express each term:

√5 is already √5.

1/√5 = √5 / 5.

similarly, √7 is √7.

1/√7 = √7 / 7.

so, the expression becomes:

√5 + (√5)/5 + √7 + (√7)/7.

now, combine like terms:

for √5: 1 + 1/5 = 6/5.

for √7: 1 + 1/7 = 8/7.

so, the expression is (6/5)√5 + (8/7)√7.

now, to combine these into a single fraction, find a common denominator for 6/5 and 8/7, which is 35.

so, (6/5)√5 = (6*7)/(5*7)√5 = 42/35 √5.

similarly, (8/7)√7 = (8*5)/(7*5)√7 = 40/35 √7.

therefore, the expression is (42√5 + 40√7)/35.

so, a = 42, b = 40, c = 35.

therefore, a + b + c = 42 + 40 + 35 = 117.

but earlier, i thought that maybe c can be smaller, but it seems 35 is the smallest possible.

alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach that could lead to a smaller c.

let me see.

wait, maybe i can factor numerator and denominator.

42√5 + 40√7 = 2(21√5 + 20√7).

and denominator is 35.

so, (2(21√5 + 20√7))/35 = 2(21√5 + 20√7)/35.

but 2 and 35 have a common factor of 1, so c cannot be reduced further.

alternatively, perhaps there's a way to write the original expression differently.

let me consider rationalizing the entire expression.

wait, perhaps i can write the original expression as a single fraction.

original expression: √5 + 1/√5 + √7 + 1/√7.

let me combine √5 and √7 first, then the reciprocals.

√5 + √7 + 1/√5 + 1/√7.

alternatively, perhaps factor √5 and √7 from certain terms.

alternatively, perhaps consider the entire expression as:

(√5 + √7) + (1/√5 + 1/√7).

now, to combine these, perhaps find a common denominator for the second part.

1/√5 + 1/√7 = (√7 + √5)/(√5 * √7).

so, the expression is (√5 + √7) + (√5 + √7)/(√5 * √7).

let me denote x = √5 + √7.

then, the expression becomes x + x/(√5 * √7).

factor x: x(1 + 1/(√5 * √7)).

now, √5 * √7 = √35.

so, x(1 + 1/√35).

now, x = √5 + √7.

so, the expression is (√5 + √7)(1 + 1/√35).

now, let's multiply these two terms.

first, √5 * 1 = √5.

next, √5 * 1/√35 = √5 / √35 = √(5/35) = √(1/7) = 1/√7.

then, √7 * 1 = √7.

finally, √7 * 1/√35 = √7 / √35 = √(7/35) = √(1/5) = 1/√5.

so, overall, we have √5 + 1/√7 + √7 + 1/√5, which is the original expression.

hmm, that didn't help much.

let me try another approach.

perhaps consider the entire expression over a common denominator.

original expression: √5 + 1/√5 + √7 + 1/√7.

let me write all terms with denominator √5 * √7 = √35.

so, √5 = √5 * √35 / √35 = √(5*35)/√35 = √175 / √35.

similarly, 1/√5 = 1/√5 * √35 / √35 = √35 / (5√35) = 1/5.

wait, that seems off.

alternatively, to write √5 with denominator √35, multiply numerator and denominator by √7:

√5 = √5 * √7 / √7 = √35 / √7.

wait, that's not helpful.

alternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the initial approach.

so, we have (42√5 + 40√7)/35.

and since there are no common factors among 42, 40, and 35, c = 35 is the smallest possible denominator.

therefore, a + b + c = 42 + 40 + 35 = 117.

but, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that c cannot be smaller.

let me check if 42√5 + 40√7 can be simplified further.

is there a common factor in 42 and 40 that can be factored out, and adjust c accordingly?

42 and 40 are both divisible by 2.

so, 42√5 + 40√7 = 2(21√5 + 20√7).

therefore, (42√5 + 40√7)/35 = 2(21√5 + 20√7)/35 = (21√5 + 20√7)/35 * 2.

wait, that doesn't seem helpful.

alternatively, perhaps i can write it as (21√5 + 20√7)/35 * 2, but that complicates things.

alternatively, perhaps factor out something else.

wait, 21 and 20 have a common factor of 1, and 35 and 2 have no common factors, so c remains 35.

therefore, i think c cannot be reduced further.

thus, the final answer is a + b + c = 42 + 40 + 35 = 117.

but, to make sure, let's try to see if there's a different approach that could lead to a smaller c.

alternatively, perhaps consider that √5 + 1/√5 = (√5)^2 + 1 / √5 = 5 + 1 / √5, which doesn't seem helpful.

alternatively, perhaps consider multiplying numerator and denominator by √5 * √7 to eliminate denominators.

wait, but that would complicate things.

alternatively, perhaps consider that √5 + 1/√5 = (√5 + 1/√5) = (√5)^2 + 1 / √5 = 5 + 1/√5, which is not useful.

alternatively, perhaps consider that √5 + 1/√5 = (√5 + 1/√5) = (√5)^2 + 1 / √5 = 5 + 1 / √5, which again is not helpful.

alternatively, maybe consider that √5 + 1/√5 = (√5 + 1/√5) = (√5 * √5 + 1) / √5 = (5 + 1)/√5 = 6/√5.

similarly, √7 + 1/√7 = 8/√7.

so, the expression is 6/√5 + 8/√7.

now, to write this as (a√5 + b√7)/c, perhaps find a common denominator.

as earlier, 6/√5 + 8/√7 = (6√7 + 8√5)/(√5 * √7) = (6√7 + 8√5)/√35.

but, this is not in the desired form, because c should be an integer, and √35 is irrational.

alternatively, to rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by √35.

so, (6√7 + 8√5)/√35 * √35/√35 = (6√7 * √35 + 8√5 * √35)/35.

now, √7 * √35 = √(7*35) = √245 = √(49*5) = 7√5.

similarly, √5 * √35 = √(5*35) = √175 = √(25*7) = 5√7.

so, the expression becomes (6*7√5 + 8*5√7)/35 = (42√5 + 40√7)/35.

again, same as before.

therefore, a = 42, b = 40, c = 35.

hence, a + b + c = 117.

therefore, the answer is 117.
