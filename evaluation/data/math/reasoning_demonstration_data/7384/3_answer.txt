Answer: The smallest four-digit positive integer with all distinct digits that is divisible by each of its digits is **1236**.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Range:**
   - We are looking for a four-digit number between 1000 and 9999.

2. **Conditions:**
   - All digits must be different.
   - The number must be divisible by each of its digits.
   - The number cannot contain zero, as division by zero is undefined.

3. **Starting from the Smallest Numbers:**
   - Begin checking from the smallest four-digit numbers while ensuring no zeros and no repeating digits.

4. **Checking 1236:**
   - Digits: 1, 2, 3, 6 (all distinct, no zeros).
   - Divisibility:
     - 1236 รท 1 = 1236 (integer).
     - 1236 รท 2 = 618 (integer).
     - 1236 รท 3 = 412 (integer).
     - 1236 รท 6 = 206 (integer).
   - All divisions result in integers, so 1236 meets the criteria.

5. **Verification of Smaller Numbers:**
   - After checking smaller candidates systematically (e.g., numbers starting with 10, 11, 12, 13, etc.), no valid number smaller than 1236 was found that satisfies all conditions.

**Conclusion:**
- **1236** is the smallest four-digit number with distinct, non-zero digits that is divisible by each of its digits.
