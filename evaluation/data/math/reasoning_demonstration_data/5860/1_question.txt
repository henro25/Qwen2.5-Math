Problem: Let $A$ and $B$ be the endpoints of a semicircular arc of radius $2$. The arc is divided into seven congruent arcs by six equally spaced points $C_1$, $C_2$, $\dots$, $C_6$. All chords of the form $\overline {AC_i}$ or $\overline {BC_i}$ are drawn. Find the product of the lengths of these twelve chords.
