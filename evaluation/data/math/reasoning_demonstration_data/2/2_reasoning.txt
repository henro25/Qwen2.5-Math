Reasoning: Okay, so I have this problem here: "What is the number of square meters in the area of a circle with diameter 4 meters? Express your answer in terms of π." Alright, let's see how to approach this.

First, I know that the area of a circle is calculated using the formula A = πr², where r is the radius of the circle. But wait, the problem gives me the diameter, not the radius. I remember that the radius is half of the diameter. So, if the diameter is 4 meters, then the radius should be 4 divided by 2, which is 2 meters. That makes sense.

Now, plugging the radius back into the area formula: A = π*(2)². Squaring 2 gives me 4, so the area should be π*4, which is 4π square meters. That seems straightforward, but maybe I'm missing something.

Let me double-check the formula for the area of a circle. Yes, A = πr² is correct. And since the radius is half the diameter, that part is also correct. Okay, I think I'm on the right track.

Is there another way to look at this? Maybe using the diameter directly in the formula? I recall there's a formula for the area in terms of diameter: A = (πd²)/4. Let's try that with d = 4 meters. Plugging in, A = (π*(4)²)/4 = (π*16)/4 = 4π. Same answer as before. Good, that matches.

I guess I'm confident now that the area is 4π square meters. I don't think I need to do anything else here. The problem asked for the answer in terms of π, so I don't need to approximate it or anything.

Just to be thorough, let's consider the units. The diameter is in meters, so the radius is also in meters. Squaring the radius gives square meters, and multiplying by π keeps it in square meters. So the units check out.

I think that's it. I've got the answer: 4π square meters.
