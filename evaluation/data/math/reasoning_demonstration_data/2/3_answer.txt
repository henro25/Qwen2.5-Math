Answer: To find the area of a circle with a diameter of 4 meters, we use the formula for the area of a circle in terms of its radius:

\[
A = \pi r^2
\]

Since the radius is half of the diameter, we calculate:

\[
r = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ meters}
\]

Now, substitute the radius into the area formula:

\[
A = \pi (2)^2 = \pi \times 4 = 4\pi \text{ square meters}
\]

Thus, the area of the circle is:

\[
\boxed{4\pi}
\]
