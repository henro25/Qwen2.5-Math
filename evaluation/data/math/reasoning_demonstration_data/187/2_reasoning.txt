Reasoning: Okay, so I've got this problem here: bacteria in a lab dish double every four hours, and there are currently 500 bacteria cells. I need to find out in how many hours there will be exactly 32,000 bacteria. Hmm, let's see.

First, I need to understand what's going on. The bacteria are doubling every four hours, which means their number increases by a factor of two every four hours. So, starting with 500, after four hours, there will be 1000, then after another four hours, 2000, and so on.

I guess I can keep doubling until I reach 32,000 and count how many steps that takes. Let's try that:

- Start: 500

- After 4 hours: 500 * 2 = 1000

- After 8 hours: 1000 * 2 = 2000

- After 12 hours: 2000 * 2 = 4000

- After 16 hours: 4000 * 2 = 8000

- After 20 hours: 8000 * 2 = 16,000

- After 24 hours: 16,000 * 2 = 32,000

So, it looks like it takes 24 hours to go from 500 to 32,000 bacteria. But is there a better way to do this without listing each step?

Maybe I can use exponents or logarithms. Since the bacteria double every four hours, this is exponential growth. The formula for exponential growth is:

N = N0 * (2)^(t/T)

Where:

- N is the final amount

- N0 is the initial amount

- t is the time elapsed

- T is the doubling time

In this case, N0 is 500, N is 32,000, and T is 4 hours. So plugging in the values:

32,000 = 500 * (2)^(t/4)

I need to solve for t. First, divide both sides by 500:

32,000 / 500 = (2)^(t/4)

64 = (2)^(t/4)

Now, 64 is a power of 2. Let's see, 2^6 = 64.

So, 2^6 = (2)^(t/4)

Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal:

6 = t/4

Then, t = 6 * 4 = 24 hours

Okay, that matches what I got earlier by doubling each time. So, the answer should be 24 hours.

But wait, maybe I should check if there's a different way to approach this, just to be sure.

Another way could be to use logarithms. Taking the natural log of both sides:

ln(32,000) = ln(500 * (2)^(t/4))

Using logarithm properties:

ln(32,000) = ln(500) + ln(2^(t/4)) = ln(500) + (t/4) * ln(2)

So,

t/4 = (ln(32,000) - ln(500)) / ln(2)

t = 4 * (ln(32,000) - ln(500)) / ln(2)

I can calculate the values:

ln(32,000) ≈ 10.377

ln(500) ≈ 6.213

ln(2) ≈ 0.693

So,

t = 4 * (10.377 - 6.213) / 0.693 = 4 * (4.164) / 0.693 ≈ 4 * 6 ≈ 24 hours

Again, I get 24 hours. So, this confirms my previous answer.

Is there any other way to look at this? Maybe using a table or graph, but I think the mathematical approaches I've used are sufficient.

Just to make sure, let's check if starting with 500 and doubling every 4 hours actually reaches 32,000 in 24 hours.

- Start: 500

- After 4 hours: 1,000

- After 8 hours: 2,000

- After 12 hours: 4,000

- After 16 hours: 8,000

- After 20 hours: 16,000

- After 24 hours: 32,000

Yes, that checks out.

I think I've covered all bases here. The answer is definitely 24 hours.
