Reasoning: So i have this problem where allie and betty are playing a game with a standard die, and they earn points based on the number they roll, according to this function f(n):

f(n) = {

6 if n is a multiple of both 2 and 3,

2 if n is only a multiple of 2,

0 if n is not a multiple of 2.

}

allie rolls the die four times and gets a 5, 4, 1, and 2.

betty rolls and gets 6, 3, 3, and 2.

i need to find the product of allie's total points and betty's total points.

first, i need to understand the scoring system.

let's look at the function f(n):

- if n is a multiple of both 2 and 3, which means n is a multiple of 6, then f(n) = 6.

- if n is only a multiple of 2, meaning it's even but not a multiple of 3, then f(n) = 2.

- if n is not a multiple of 2, meaning it's odd, then f(n) = 0.

so, for each roll, depending on the number rolled, they get points as per f(n).

first, let's list out the possible outcomes of a standard die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

now, let's determine f(n) for each possible n:

- n=1: not a multiple of 2 → f(1)=0

- n=2: multiple of 2 but not of 3 → f(2)=2

- n=3: not a multiple of 2 → f(3)=0

- n=4: multiple of 2 but not of 3 → f(4)=2

- n=5: not a multiple of 2 → f(5)=0

- n=6: multiple of both 2 and 3 → f(6)=6

so, f(n) is 6 for 6, 2 for 2 and 4, and 0 for 1, 3, and 5.

now, let's calculate allie's total points.

allie rolled: 5, 4, 1, and 2.

using f(n):

- f(5) = 0

- f(4) = 2

- f(1) = 0

- f(2) = 2

so, allie's points: 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4 points.

now, betty rolled: 6, 3, 3, and 2.

using f(n):

- f(6) = 6

- f(3) = 0

- f(3) = 0

- f(2) = 2

so, betty's points: 6 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 8 points.

now, the product of allie's total points and betty's total points is 4 * 8 = 32.

wait a minute, is that all? it seems straightforward. maybe i should double-check my calculations.

for allie:

- 5: f(5)=0

- 4: f(4)=2

- 1: f(1)=0

- 2: f(2)=2

total: 0+2+0+2=4. that seems correct.

for betty:

- 6: f(6)=6

- 3: f(3)=0

- 3: f(3)=0

- 2: f(2)=2

total: 6+0+0+2=8. that also seems correct.

product: 4 * 8 = 32.

i don't see any mistakes here. the function definitions are clear, and i've applied them correctly to each roll.

i guess the answer is 32.

**final answer**

32
