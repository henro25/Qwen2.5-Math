Answer: First, we define the function \( f(n) \) based on the rules provided:

\[
f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
6 & \text{if } n \text{ is a multiple of both 2 and 3}, \\
2 & \text{if } n \text{ is only a multiple of 2}, \\
0 & \text{if } n \text{ is not a multiple of 2}.
\end{array}
\right.
\]

next, we calculate the points for each roll:

for allie's rolls (5, 4, 1, 2):
\[
\begin{aligned}
f(5) &= 0, \\
f(4) &= 2, \\
f(1) &= 0, \\
f(2) &= 2.
\end{aligned}
\]
total points for allie:
\[
0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4.
\]

for betty's rolls (6, 3, 3, 2):
\[
\begin{aligned}
f(6) &= 6, \\
f(3) &= 0, \\
f(3) &= 0, \\
f(2) &= 2.
\end{aligned}
\]
total points for betty:
\[
6 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 8.
\]

finally, the product of allie's total points and betty's total points is:
\[
4 \times 8 = 32.
\]

\[
\boxed{32}
\]
