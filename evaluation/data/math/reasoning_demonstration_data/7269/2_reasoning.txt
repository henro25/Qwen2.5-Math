Reasoning: Alright, so I've got this problem: "What is the smallest positive integer with exactly 10 positive integer divisors?" Hmm, interesting. I need to find the smallest number that has exactly 10 divisors. I remember that the number of divisors a number has is related to its prime factorization, but I'm not entirely sure how. Let me think about this.

First, I need to recall how to find the number of divisors of a number based on its prime factors. I think it involves exponents in the prime factorization. For example, if a number is expressed as a product of primes raised to certain powers, like 
n
=
p
a
×
q
b
×
r
c
n=p 
a
 ×q 
b
 ×r 
c
 , then the number of divisors is something like (a+1)(b+1)(c+1). Yeah, that sounds familiar.

So, if I have a number with prime factors raised to exponents a, b, c, etc., the total number of divisors is the product of each exponent plus one. That means for a number to have exactly 10 divisors, the product of (exponent + 1) for each prime factor should be 10.

Now, 10 can be factored in a few ways: 10 = 10×1, 5×2, or 2×5, and so on. But since exponents are positive integers, and we're looking to minimize the number itself, I should probably use the smallest primes possible and arrange the exponents in a way that gives the smallest product.

Let's consider the possible combinations for the exponents:

1. One prime factor with exponent 9: 
n
=
p
9
n=p 
9
 . The number of divisors would be 9 + 1 = 10.

2. Two prime factors with exponents 4 and 1: 
n
=
p
4
×
q
1
n=p 
4
 ×q 
1
 . The number of divisors would be (4+1)(1+1) = 5×2 = 10.

3. Two prime factors with exponents 2 and 3: 
n
=
p
2
×
q
3
n=p 
2
 ×q 
3
 . The number of divisors would be (2+1)(3+1) = 3×4 = 12. Oh, that's too many.

4. Three prime factors with exponents 1 each: 
n
=
p
1
×
q
1
×
r
1
n=p 
1
 ×q 
1
 ×r 
1
 . The number of divisors would be (1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 2×2×2 = 8. Not enough.

So, options 1 and 2 give exactly 10 divisors. Option 3 gives too many, and option 4 gives too few. Now, I need to find which of these options gives the smallest number.

Option 1: 
n
=
p
9
n=p 
9
 . To minimize n, I should choose the smallest prime, which is 2. So, 
n
=
2
9
=
512
n=2 
9
 =512.

Option 2: 
n
=
p
4
×
q
1
n=p 
4
 ×q 
1
 . Again, choosing the smallest primes, p=2 and q=3. So, 
n
=
2
4
×
3
1
=
16
×
3
=
48
n=2 
4
 ×3 
1
 =16×3=48.

Comparing 512 and 48, 48 is smaller. Is there any other combination that could give a smaller number?

Wait, could there be a combination with three prime factors? Let's see. If I have three prime factors, the exponents would need to satisfy (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) = 10. But 10 can't be expressed as a product of three integers greater than 1, except for 2×2×something, but that doesn't work since 2×2×something would be at least 2×2×2=8, which is less than 10, and 2×5×1=10, but having an exponent of 0 doesn't make sense because that would mean omitting that prime factor.

So, it seems like the only viable options are the ones I already considered: 
p
9
p 
9
  and 
p
4
×
q
1
p 
4
 ×q 
1
 . Between those, 48 is smaller than 512.

Is there any other way to arrange the exponents to get exactly 10 divisors with a smaller number? Let's check another combination just to be sure.

What if I have 
p
1
×
q
4
p 
1
 ×q 
4
 ? That would be 
2
1
×
3
4
=
2
×
81
=
162
2 
1
 ×3 
4
 =2×81=162, which is larger than 48.

Or 
p
2
×
q
2
p 
2
 ×q 
2
 : 
2
2
×
3
2
=
4
×
9
=
36
2 
2
 ×3 
2
 =4×9=36. But the number of divisors would be (2+1)(2+1) = 3×3 = 9, which is less than 10. So that's not it.

Another thought: what if I have four prime factors? For example, 
p
1
×
q
1
×
r
1
×
s
1
p 
1
 ×q 
1
 ×r 
1
 ×s 
1
 . The number of divisors would be (1+1)^4 = 16, which is more than 10. But that's too many.

Wait, no. Actually, for four distinct primes, the number of divisors would be (1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 16, which is more than 10.

So, it seems like the best option is 
p
4
×
q
1
p 
4
 ×q 
1
 , with p=2 and q=3, giving n=48.

Just to double-check, let's list the divisors of 48:

1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48.

That's exactly 10 divisors. Perfect.

Is there any smaller number than 48 that has exactly 10 divisors? Let's see. Maybe 36: divisors are 1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36 – that's 9 divisors, not 10.

40: divisors are 1,2,4,5,8,10,20,40 – that's 8 divisors.

42: 1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42 – 8 divisors.

44: 1,2,4,11,22,44 – 6 divisors.

45: 1,3,5,9,15,45 – 6 divisors.

46: 1,2,23,46 – 4 divisors.

47: 1,47 – 2 divisors.

48: As above, 10 divisors.

49: 1,7,49 – 3 divisors.

50: 1,2,5,10,25,50 – 6 divisors.

So, yes, 48 is the smallest number with exactly 10 divisors.

I think that's it. I don't see any smaller number that fits the criteria.
