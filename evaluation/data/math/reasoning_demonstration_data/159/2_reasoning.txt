Reasoning: So i've got this problem here about finding the average percent score for 100 students based on the data provided. let's see, there's a table that shows different percent scores and how many students got each score. i need to find the average percent score for all these students.

first, i need to understand what an average is. the average, or mean, is calculated by adding up all the values and then dividing by the number of values. in this case, the values are the percent scores, and the number of values is the number of students, which is 100.

but wait, the table doesn't list each student's score individually; it groups the scores into categories with the number of students who got each score. so, i need to find a way to account for that.

let me look at the table again:

%
 score
number of students
100
7
90
18
80
35
70
25
60
10
50
3
40
2
% score
100
90
80
70
60
50
40
​
  
number of students
7
18
35
25
10
3
2
​
 
​
 
so, there are 7 students who scored 100%, 18 who scored 90%, and so on, down to 2 students who scored 40%.

to find the average, i need to calculate the total sum of all the percent scores and then divide that by the total number of students, which is 100.

let's denote the percentage scores as 
p
i
p 
i
​
  and the number of students who got each score as 
n
i
n 
i
​
 . the total sum of all scores would be the sum of each score multiplied by the number of students who got that score.

mathematically, that would be:

total sum
=
∑
(
p
i
×
n
i
)
total sum=∑(p 
i
​
 ×n 
i
​
 )
then, the average score 
p
ˉ
p
ˉ
​
  would be:

p
ˉ
=
total sum
total number of students
=
∑
(
p
i
×
n
i
)
100
p
ˉ
​
 = 
total number of students
total sum
​
 = 
100
∑(p 
i
​
 ×n 
i
​
 )
​
 
alright, so i need to compute each 
p
i
×
n
i
p 
i
​
 ×n 
i
​
 , sum them up, and then divide by 100.

let's do this step by step.

first, for the 100% score:

100
%
×
7
=
700
100%×7=700
next, for the 90% score:

90
%
×
18
=
1620
90%×18=1620
then, for the 80% score:

80
%
×
35
=
2800
80%×35=2800
next, for the 70% score:

70
%
×
25
=
1750
70%×25=1750
then, for the 60% score:

60
%
×
10
=
600
60%×10=600
after that, for the 50% score:

50
%
×
3
=
150
50%×3=150
finally, for the 40% score:

40
%
×
2
=
80
40%×2=80
now, i need to add up all these products to get the total sum:

700
+
1620
+
2800
+
1750
+
600
+
150
+
80
=
?
700+1620+2800+1750+600+150+80=?
let me add them one by one.

first, 700 + 1620 = 2320

then, 2320 + 2800 = 5120

next, 5120 + 1750 = 6870

then, 6870 + 600 = 7470

after that, 7470 + 150 = 7620

finally, 7620 + 80 = 7700

so, the total sum of all percent scores is 7700.

now, to find the average, i divide this sum by the total number of students, which is 100.

p
ˉ
=
7700
100
=
77
p
ˉ
​
 = 
100
7700
​
 =77
therefore, the average percent score for these 100 students is 77%.

wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

first, checking the multiplication:

- 100% * 7 = 700 ✔️

- 90% * 18 = 1620 ✔️

- 80% * 35 = 2800 ✔️

- 70% * 25 = 1750 ✔️

- 60% * 10 = 600 ✔️

- 50% * 3 = 150 ✔️

- 40% * 2 = 80 ✔️

now, adding them up:

700 + 1620 = 2320 ✔️

2320 + 2800 = 5120 ✔️

5120 + 1750 = 6870 ✔️

6870 + 600 = 7470 ✔️

7470 + 150 = 7620 ✔️

7620 + 80 = 7700 ✔️

total sum is indeed 7700, and dividing by 100 gives 77%.

so, the average percent score is 77%.

just to be thorough, maybe i can think of another way to approach this problem, like calculating the weighted average.

in this case, the weights are the number of students, and the values are the percent scores.

the formula for the weighted average is:

p
ˉ
=
∑
(
p
i
×
n
i
)
∑
n
i
p
ˉ
​
 = 
∑n 
i
​
 
∑(p 
i
​
 ×n 
i
​
 )
​
 
which is essentially what i did earlier, since 
∑
n
i
=
100
∑n 
i
​
 =100.

alternatively, i could calculate the percentage of students in each score category and then find the weighted average based on those percentages.

but that seems more complicated, and my initial method seems straightforward and correct.

i don't think there's any error in my calculations, so i'm confident that the average percent score is 77%.

**final answer**

77
77
