Reasoning: Let's tackle this problem step by step. we have four prime numbers, a, b, c, and d, that form an increasing arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6. also, a is greater than 5. we need to find the ones digit of a.

first, let's recall what an arithmetic sequence is. in an arithmetic sequence, each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference to the preceding term. here, the common difference is 6. so, the sequence looks like this:

a, a + 6, a + 12, a + 18

and all these terms are primes, with a > 5.

our goal is to find the ones digit of a.

since we're dealing with primes greater than 5, none of them can be even numbers or multiples of 5, except for the prime number 2 and 5 themselves, but since a > 5, we can ignore 2 and 5 for a.

let's think about the possible ones digits for prime numbers greater than 5. the ones digit of a prime number greater than 5 can only be 1, 3, 7, or 9. this is because:

- if a number ends with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, it's even and greater than 2, so not prime.

- if a number ends with 5 and is greater than 5, it's divisible by 5, so not prime.

so, the possible ones digits for a are 1, 3, 7, or 9.

now, since we have an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6, let's look at how the ones digits change when we add 6 to a number.

let's consider each possible ones digit for a and see what happens when we add 6 successively:

1. if a ends with 1:

- a ends with 1

- a + 6 ends with 7

- a + 12 ends with 3

- a + 18 ends with 9

2. if a ends with 3:

- a ends with 3

- a + 6 ends with 9

- a + 12 ends with 5

- a + 18 ends with 1

but wait, if a ends with 3, then a + 12 ends with 5. however, a + 12 must be a prime greater than 5, and any number ending with 5 greater than 5 is divisible by 5, hence not prime. so, a cannot end with 3.

3. if a ends with 7:

- a ends with 7

- a + 6 ends with 3

- a + 12 ends with 9

- a + 18 ends with 5

again, a + 18 ends with 5, which would make it divisible by 5 and greater than 5, hence not prime. so, a cannot end with 7.

4. if a ends with 9:

- a ends with 9

- a + 6 ends with 5

- a + 12 ends with 1

- a + 18 ends with 7

here, a + 6 ends with 5, which again would make it divisible by 5 and greater than 5, so not prime. therefore, a cannot end with 9.

from this analysis, the only possible ones digit for a is 1. let's double-check this conclusion.

if a ends with 1, then:

- a is prime.

- a + 6 ends with 7, which can be prime.

- a + 12 ends with 3, which can be prime.

- a + 18 ends with 9, which can be prime.

now, we need to confirm if there actually exist primes a, a + 6, a + 12, and a + 18 where a ends with 1 and a > 5.

let's try some examples:

take a = 11:

- 11 is prime.

- 11 + 6 = 17, which is prime.

- 11 + 12 = 23, which is prime.

- 11 + 18 = 29, which is prime.

so, 11, 17, 23, 29 is a valid sequence.

another example: a = 101

- 101 is prime.

- 101 + 6 = 107, which is prime.

- 101 + 12 = 113, which is prime.

- 101 + 18 = 119, which is not prime (119 = 7 * 17).

so, this sequence doesn't work.

let's try a = 19:

- 19 is prime.

- 19 + 6 = 25, which is not prime.

so, invalid.

another one: a = 5:

- but a > 5, so we can't use a = 5.

a = 7:

- 7 is prime.

- 7 + 6 = 13, prime.

- 7 + 12 = 19, prime.

- 7 + 18 = 25, not prime.

invalid.

a = 13:

- 13 is prime.

- 13 + 6 = 19, prime.

- 13 + 12 = 25, not prime.

invalid.

a = 17:

- 17 is prime.

- 17 + 6 = 23, prime.

- 17 + 12 = 29, prime.

- 17 + 18 = 35, not prime.

invalid.

a = 19:

- already checked, invalid.

a = 23:

- 23 is prime.

- 23 + 6 = 29, prime.

- 23 + 12 = 35, not prime.

invalid.

a = 29:

- 29 is prime.

- 29 + 6 = 35, not prime.

invalid.

a = 31:

- 31 is prime.

- 31 + 6 = 37, prime.

- 31 + 12 = 43, prime.

- 31 + 18 = 49, not prime.

invalid.

a = 37:

- 37 is prime.

- 37 + 6 = 43, prime.

- 37 + 12 = 49, not prime.

invalid.

a = 41:

- 41 is prime.

- 41 + 6 = 47, prime.

- 41 + 12 = 53, prime.

- 41 + 18 = 59, prime.

so, 41, 47, 53, 59 is another valid sequence.

from these examples, it seems that when a ends with 1, there are sequences where all four numbers are prime. for other ending digits (3, 7, 9), at least one of the terms in the sequence becomes a multiple of 5 and hence not prime.

therefore, the ones digit of a must be 1.
