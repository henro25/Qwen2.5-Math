Answer: Given four prime numbers \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) forming an increasing arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6 and \( a > 5 \), we need to find the ones digit of \( a \).

the sequence is:
\[ a, a+6, a+12, a+18 \]

since \( a > 5 \) and all terms are primes, the ones digit of \( a \) must be such that none of the terms in the sequence are divisible by 2 or 5 (except for the prime numbers 2 and 5 themselves, which are not applicable here).

the possible ones digits for a prime number greater than 5 are 1, 3, 7, or 9. we analyze each case:

1. if \( a \) ends with 1:
   \[ a \text{ ends with } 1 \]
   \[ a + 6 \text{ ends with } 7 \]
   \[ a + 12 \text{ ends with } 3 \]
   \[ a + 18 \text{ ends with } 9 \]
   all these endings are possible for primes.

2. if \( a \) ends with 3:
   \[ a \text{ ends with } 3 \]
   \[ a + 6 \text{ ends with } 9 \]
   \[ a + 12 \text{ ends with } 5 \]
   \[ a + 18 \text{ ends with } 1 \]
   \( a + 12 \) ends with 5, which is not prime (except for 5 itself).

3. if \( a \) ends with 7:
   \[ a \text{ ends with } 7 \]
   \[ a + 6 \text{ ends with } 3 \]
   \[ a + 12 \text{ ends with } 9 \]
   \[ a + 18 \text{ ends with } 5 \]
   \( a + 18 \) ends with 5, which is not prime (except for 5 itself).

4. if \( a \) ends with 9:
   \[ a \text{ ends with } 9 \]
   \[ a + 6 \text{ ends with } 5 \]
   \[ a + 12 \text{ ends with } 1 \]
   \[ a + 18 \text{ ends with } 7 \]
   \( a + 6 \) ends with 5, which is not prime (except for 5 itself).

from this analysis, the only possible ones digit for \( a \) is 1. we verify this with examples:

- for \( a = 11 \):
  \[ 11, 17, 23, 29 \] are all primes.

- for \( a = 41 \):
  \[ 41, 47, 53, 59 \] are all primes.

thus, the ones digit of \( a \) must be 1.

\[
\boxed{1}
\]
