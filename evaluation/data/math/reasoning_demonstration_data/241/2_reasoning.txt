Reasoning: So i have this problem here: in the complex plane, the graph of |z - 3| = 2|z + 3| intersects the graph of |z| = k in exactly one point. i need to find all possible values of k.

first off, i need to understand what these equations represent in the complex plane. the equation |z - 3| = 2|z + 3| is an equation involving complex numbers, and |z| = k is a circle centered at the origin with radius k.

let me recall that for a complex number z = x + yi, |z - a| represents the distance from z to the point a in the complex plane. so, |z - 3| is the distance from z to 3 (which is the point (3,0) in the plane), and |z + 3| is the distance from z to -3 (the point (-3,0)).

so, |z - 3| = 2|z + 3| means that the distance from z to 3 is twice the distance from z to -3. this kind of equation should represent some sort of locus of points in the plane. i think it's going to be a circle or some conic section.

similarly, |z| = k is a circle centered at the origin with radius k.

now, i need to find the values of k such that these two graphs intersect at exactly one point. that means the two circles are tangent to each other, right? because if they intersect at exactly one point, they're tangent.

but wait, is the first equation actually a circle? let me check.

let me set z = x + yi, where x and y are real numbers. then,

|z - 3| = |(x - 3) + yi| = sqrt((x - 3)^2 + y^2)

|z + 3| = |(x + 3) + yi| = sqrt((x + 3)^2 + y^2)

so, the equation |z - 3| = 2|z + 3| becomes:

sqrt((x - 3)^2 + y^2) = 2 sqrt((x + 3)^2 + y^2)

to eliminate the square roots, i'll square both sides:

(x - 3)^2 + y^2 = 4[(x + 3)^2 + y^2]

let me expand both sides:

left side: (x - 3)^2 + y^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2

right side: 4[(x + 3)^2 + y^2] = 4(x^2 + 6x + 9 + y^2) = 4x^2 + 24x + 36 + 4y^2

so, x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 = 4x^2 + 24x + 36 + 4y^2

let me bring all terms to one side:

x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 - 4x^2 - 24x - 36 - 4y^2 = 0

combine like terms:

-3x^2 - 30x - 27 - 3y^2 = 0

i can divide the entire equation by -3 to simplify:

x^2 + 10x + 9 + y^2 = 0

hmm, that doesn't look right. a circle equation should be in the form (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, where r is the radius. but here, the left side is x^2 + 10x + 9 + y^2 = 0.

wait, maybe i made a mistake in the algebra. let me double-check the expansion.

original equation after squaring:

(x - 3)^2 + y^2 = 4[(x + 3)^2 + y^2]

expand left side: x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2

expand right side: 4(x^2 + 6x + 9 + y^2) = 4x^2 + 24x + 36 + 4y^2

bring all terms to left:

x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 - 4x^2 - 24x - 36 - 4y^2 = 0

combine like terms:

-3x^2 - 30x - 27 - 3y^2 = 0

divide by -3:

x^2 + 10x + 9 + y^2 = 0

wait, this seems off. a sum of squares equal to zero would only be true if x^2 + 10x + 9 + y^2 = 0, which would only be possible if x and y are such that x^2 + 10x + 9 + y^2 = 0.

but x^2 + 10x + y^2 + 9 = 0

this looks like a circle equation, but let's complete the square for x.

x^2 + 10x + y^2 + 9 = 0

x^2 + 10x + 25 + y^2 + 9 - 25 = 0

(x + 5)^2 + y^2 - 16 = 0

so, (x + 5)^2 + y^2 = 16

ah, there we go! so, the equation |z - 3| = 2|z + 3| represents a circle centered at (-5, 0) with radius 4.

now, the other equation is |z| = k, which is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius k.

so, we have two circles:

1. circle a: center at (-5, 0), radius 4

2. circle b: center at (0,0), radius k

we need these two circles to intersect at exactly one point, meaning they are tangent to each other.

for two circles to be tangent, the distance between their centers must be equal to the sum or the difference of their radii.

so, distance between centers: d = sqrt[(-5 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2] = sqrt(25) = 5

therefore, for tangency:

either d = r1 + r2 or d = |r1 - r2|

here, r1 = 4 (radius of circle a), r2 = k (radius of circle b)

so, either:

5 = 4 + k --> k = 1

or

5 = |4 - k|

the equation 5 = |4 - k| has two cases:

case 1: 4 - k = 5 --> k = 4 - 5 = -1

but k represents a radius, which can't be negative, so k = -1 is invalid.

case 2: -(4 - k) = 5 --> -4 + k = 5 --> k = 9

so, possible k values are k = 1 and k = 9

therefore, the possible values of k are 1 and 9.
