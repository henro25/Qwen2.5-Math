Answer: To solve the problem, we start by interpreting the given equations in the complex plane. the equation \(|z - 3| = 2|z + 3|\) represents the set of points \(z = x + yi\) such that the distance from \(z\) to \(3\) is twice the distance from \(z\) to \(-3\). this can be written as:

\[
\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + y^2} = 2 \sqrt{(x + 3)^2 + y^2}
\]

squaring both sides, we get:

\[
(x - 3)^2 + y^2 = 4[(x + 3)^2 + y^2]
\]

expanding and simplifying:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 = 4(x^2 + 6x + 9 + y^2)
\]

\[
x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 = 4x^2 + 24x + 36 + 4y^2
\]

\[
x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 - 4x^2 - 24x - 36 - 4y^2 = 0
\]

\[
-3x^2 - 30x - 27 - 3y^2 = 0
\]

dividing by \(-3\):

\[
x^2 + 10x + 9 + y^2 = 0
\]

completing the square for \(x\):

\[
(x + 5)^2 + y^2 = 16
\]

this represents a circle centered at \((-5, 0)\) with radius 4.

the equation \(|z| = k\) represents a circle centered at the origin \((0,0)\) with radius \(k\).

for these circles to intersect at exactly one point, they must be tangent to each other. the distance between their centers is:

\[
d = \sqrt{(-5 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = 5
\]

for tangency, the distance between the centers must be equal to the sum or the difference of their radii:

\[
5 = 4 + k \quad \text{or} \quad 5 = |4 - k|
\]

solving these:

1. \(5 = 4 + k \implies k = 1\)
2. \(5 = |4 - k|\)

for \(5 = |4 - k|\):

\[
4 - k = 5 \implies k = -1 \quad (\text{not possible since } k \geq 0)
\]
\[
-(4 - k) = 5 \implies k = 9
\]

thus, the possible values of \(k\) are:

\[
\boxed{1, 9}
\]
