Reasoning: So i have this problem involving logarithms, gcd, and lcm of two positive integers x and y. the equations given are:

log
⁡
10
x
+
2
log
⁡
10
(
gcd
(
x
,
y
)
)
=
60
log 
10
​
 x+2log 
10
​
 (gcd(x,y))=60
log
⁡
10
y
+
2
log
⁡
10
(
lcm
(
x
,
y
)
)
=
570
log 
10
​
 y+2log 
10
​
 (lcm(x,y))=570
and i need to find 
3
m
+
2
n
3m+2n, where m is the number of prime factors of x (counted with multiplicity), and n is the number for y.

first, i need to recall some properties of gcd and lcm. i know that for any two positive integers x and y:

gcd
(
x
,
y
)
×
lcm
(
x
,
y
)
=
x
×
y
gcd(x,y)×lcm(x,y)=x×y
that's a fundamental property that might be useful here.

also, i need to remember logarithm properties, especially the power rule and the product rule.

the power rule is:

log
⁡
b
(
a
k
)
=
k
log
⁡
b
a
log 
b
​
 (a 
k
 )=klog 
b
​
 a
and the product rule is:

log
⁡
b
(
a
×
c
)
=
log
⁡
b
a
+
log
⁡
b
c
log 
b
​
 (a×c)=log 
b
​
 a+log 
b
​
 c
so, looking at the first equation:

log
⁡
10
x
+
2
log
⁡
10
(
gcd
(
x
,
y
)
)
=
60
log 
10
​
 x+2log 
10
​
 (gcd(x,y))=60
i can use the power rule to bring the 2 inside the log:

log
⁡
10
x
+
log
⁡
10
(
gcd
(
x
,
y
)
)
2
=
60
log 
10
​
 x+log 
10
​
 (gcd(x,y)) 
2
 =60
then, using the product rule, combine the logs:

log
⁡
10
[
x
×
(
gcd
(
x
,
y
)
)
2
]
=
60
log 
10
​
 [x×(gcd(x,y)) 
2
 ]=60
this implies:

x
×
(
gcd
(
x
,
y
)
)
2
=
1
0
60
x×(gcd(x,y)) 
2
 =10 
60
 
similarly, for the second equation:

log
⁡
10
y
+
2
log
⁡
10
(
lcm
(
x
,
y
)
)
=
570
log 
10
​
 y+2log 
10
​
 (lcm(x,y))=570
apply the power rule:

log
⁡
10
y
+
log
⁡
10
(
lcm
(
x
,
y
)
)
2
=
570
log 
10
​
 y+log 
10
​
 (lcm(x,y)) 
2
 =570
combine the logs:

log
⁡
10
[
y
×
(
lcm
(
x
,
y
)
)
2
]
=
570
log 
10
​
 [y×(lcm(x,y)) 
2
 ]=570
which means:

y
×
(
lcm
(
x
,
y
)
)
2
=
1
0
570
y×(lcm(x,y)) 
2
 =10 
570
 
now, i have two equations:

1. 
x
×
(
gcd
(
x
,
y
)
)
2
=
1
0
60
x×(gcd(x,y)) 
2
 =10 
60
 

2. 
y
×
(
lcm
(
x
,
y
)
)
2
=
1
0
570
y×(lcm(x,y)) 
2
 =10 
570
 

and i also know that:

gcd
(
x
,
y
)
×
lcm
(
x
,
y
)
=
x
×
y
gcd(x,y)×lcm(x,y)=x×y
maybe i can use this relationship to eliminate one of the variables.

let me denote 
d
=
gcd
(
x
,
y
)
d=gcd(x,y). then, i can write x and y in terms of d.

let 
x
=
d
×
a
x=d×a and 
y
=
d
×
b
y=d×b, where 
a
a and 
b
b are coprime integers (since d is the gcd).

then, 
lcm
(
x
,
y
)
=
d
×
a
×
b
lcm(x,y)=d×a×b, because a and b are coprime.

now, substitute back into the first equation:

x
×
(
gcd
(
x
,
y
)
)
2
=
d
×
a
×
d
2
=
d
3
a
=
1
0
60
x×(gcd(x,y)) 
2
 =d×a×d 
2
 =d 
3
 a=10 
60
 
so:

d
3
a
=
1
0
60
(1)
d 
3
 a=10 
60
 (1)
and the second equation:

y
×
(
lcm
(
x
,
y
)
)
2
=
d
×
b
×
(
d
×
a
×
b
)
2
=
d
×
b
×
d
2
×
a
2
×
b
2
=
d
3
a
2
b
3
=
1
0
570
(2)
y×(lcm(x,y)) 
2
 =d×b×(d×a×b) 
2
 =d×b×d 
2
 ×a 
2
 ×b 
2
 =d 
3
 a 
2
 b 
3
 =10 
570
 (2)
so now i have:

d
3
a
=
1
0
60
(1)
d 
3
 a=10 
60
 (1)
d
3
a
2
b
3
=
1
0
570
(2)
d 
3
 a 
2
 b 
3
 =10 
570
 (2)
i can divide equation (2) by equation (1):

d
3
a
2
b
3
d
3
a
=
1
0
570
1
0
60
  
⟹
  
a
b
3
=
1
0
510
d 
3
 a
d 
3
 a 
2
 b 
3
 
​
 = 
10 
60
 
10 
570
 
​
 ⟹ab 
3
 =10 
510
 
so:

a
b
3
=
1
0
510
(3)
ab 
3
 =10 
510
 (3)
now, from equation (1):

d
3
a
=
1
0
60
  
⟹
  
a
=
1
0
60
d
3
d 
3
 a=10 
60
 ⟹a= 
d 
3
 
10 
60
 
​
 
substitute this into equation (3):

1
0
60
d
3
×
b
3
=
1
0
510
d 
3
 
10 
60
 
​
 ×b 
3
 =10 
510
 
multiply both sides by 
d
3
d 
3
 :

1
0
60
×
b
3
=
1
0
510
×
d
3
10 
60
 ×b 
3
 =10 
510
 ×d 
3
 
then:

b
3
=
1
0
510
×
d
3
/
1
0
60
=
1
0
450
×
d
3
b 
3
 =10 
510
 ×d 
3
 /10 
60
 =10 
450
 ×d 
3
 
so:

b
3
=
1
0
450
×
d
3
b 
3
 =10 
450
 ×d 
3
 
take cube roots:

b
=
1
0
150
×
d
b=10 
150
 ×d
but since 
a
a and 
b
b are coprime, and 
d
d divides both x and y, i need to think about the prime factors here.

given that 
b
=
1
0
150
×
d
b=10 
150
 ×d, but b and a are coprime, and a is 
1
0
60
/
d
3
10 
60
 /d 
3
 , i need to ensure that a and b share no common prime factors.

let me consider the prime factorization of d, a, and b.

since 
d
=
gcd
(
x
,
y
)
d=gcd(x,y), and x and y are built from d, a, and b, and a and b are coprime, d must capture all the common prime factors of x and y.

given that 
x
=
d
×
a
x=d×a and 
y
=
d
×
b
y=d×b, and a and b are coprime, the exponents of the primes in d, a, and b should reflect that.

let me consider the prime factorization of 10, which is 
2
×
5
2×5. so, 10 is just made up of primes 2 and 5.

therefore, d, a, and b can only have 2 and 5 as their prime factors.

so, let me write d, a, and b in terms of powers of 2 and 5.

let:

d
=
2
k
×
5
l
d=2 
k
 ×5 
l
 
a
=
2
m
×
5
n
a=2 
m
 ×5 
n
 
b
=
2
p
×
5
q
b=2 
p
 ×5 
q
 
since a and b are coprime, they share no common prime factors, so either m or p is zero, and either n or q is zero.

but wait, since a and b are coprime, they can't both have 2 or both have 5 as factors. so, if a has 2^m and 5^n, b must have 2^p and 5^q with p=0 if m>0, and q=0 if n>0.

but actually, more precisely, since a and b are coprime, if a has 2^m (m >0), then b must have 2^0, and if a has 5^n (n >0), then b must have 5^0, and vice versa.

so, in terms of exponents:

- if m >0, then p=0

- if n >0, then q=0

but it's possible for a to have both m and n positive, and b to have neither, but since they are coprime, that's allowed.

wait, no. if a has both m and n positive, and b has p and q positive, but if p=0 or q=0 depending on a's exponents.

wait, this is getting confusing. maybe a better approach is to consider that since a and b are coprime, their exponents for each prime must be zero in one and possibly positive in the other.

given that 10 is 2 and 5, and d is a multiple of 2 and/or 5, let's think about possible cases.

first, note that d, a, and b are all powers of 2 and 5.

from equation (1):

d
3
a
=
1
0
60
=
2
60
×
5
60
d 
3
 a=10 
60
 =2 
60
 ×5 
60
 
similarly, from equation (3):

a
b
3
=
1
0
510
=
2
510
×
5
510
ab 
3
 =10 
510
 =2 
510
 ×5 
510
 
and from earlier, we have:

b
=
1
0
150
×
d
=
2
150
×
5
150
×
d
b=10 
150
 ×d=2 
150
 ×5 
150
 ×d
substituting d's expression:

b
=
2
150
×
5
150
×
2
k
×
5
l
=
2
150
+
k
×
5
150
+
l
b=2 
150
 ×5 
150
 ×2 
k
 ×5 
l
 =2 
150+k
 ×5 
150+l
 
now, since b is expressed in terms of k and l, and a is expressed from equation (1):

a
=
1
0
60
d
3
=
2
60
×
5
60
2
3
k

3l
 
2 
60
 ×5

​
 =2 
60−3k
 ×5 
60−3l
 
now, plug a and b into equation (3):

a
b
3
=
2
60
−

k
×
5
60
−
3
l
×
(
2
150
+
k
)
3
×
(
5
150

l
)
3
=

−

−

k

5

−

l
=

5
510
ab 
3
 =2 
60−3k
 ×5 
60−3l
 ×(2 
150+k
 ) 
3
 ×(5 
150+l
 ) 
3
 =2 
60−3k
 ×5 
60−3l
 ×2 
450+3k
 ×5 
450+3l
 =2 
60−3k+450+3k
 ×5 
60−3l+450+3l
 =2 
510
 ×5 
510
 
which matches equation (3), so this checks out.

now, since a and b are coprime, their exponents for each prime must not both be positive.

so, for prime 2:

either 
60
−
3
k
=
0
60−3k=0 (meaning a has no factor of 2), or 
150
+
k
=
0
150+k=0 (meaning b has no factor of 2). but 
150
+
k
=
0
150+k=0 would imply k = -150, which is impossible since k is a non-negative integer (as exponents in prime factorization are non-negative integers). therefore, 
60
−
3
k
=
0
60−3k=0, which implies k = 20.

similarly, for prime 5:

either 
60
−
3
l
=
0
60−3l=0 (meaning a has no factor of 5), or 
150
+
l
=
0
150+l=0 (meaning b has no factor of 5). again, 
150
+
l
=
0
150+l=0 is impossible, so 
60
−
3
l
=
0
60−3l=0, which implies l = 20.

so, k = 20 and l = 20.

therefore, d = 
2
20
×
5
20
2 
20
 ×5 
20
 .

then, a = 
2
60
−
3
(
20
)
×
5
60
−
3
(
20
)
=
2
60
−
60
×
5
60
−
60
=
2
0
×
5
0
=
1
2 
60−3(20)
 ×5 
60−3(20)
 =2 
60−60
 ×5 
60−60
 =2 
0
 ×5 
0
 =1.

and b = 
2
150
+
20
×
5
150
+
20
=
2
170
×
5
170
2 
150+20
 ×5 
150+20
 =2 
170
 ×5 
170
 .

therefore, x = d * a = 
2
20
×
5
20
×
1
=
2
20
×
5
20
2 
20
 ×5 
20
 ×1=2 
20
 ×5 
20
 .

and y = d * b = 
2
20
×
5
20
×
2
170
×
5
170
=
2
190
×
5
190
2 
20
 ×5 
20
 ×2 
170
 ×5 
170
 =2 
190
 ×5 
190
 .

now, m is the number of prime factors of x, counted with multiplicity. x = 
2
20
×
5
20
2 
20
 ×5 
20
 , so it has 20 factors of 2 and 20 factors of 5, totaling m = 40.

similarly, y = 
2
190
×
5
190
2 
190
 ×5 
190
 , so it has 190 factors of 2 and 190 factors of 5, totaling n = 380.

therefore, 
3
m
+
2
n
=
3
(
40
)
+
2
(
380
)
=
120
+
760
=
880
3m+2n=3(40)+2(380)=120+760=880.

**final answer**
