Answer: Given the system of equations:

\[
\log_{10} x + 2 \log_{10} (\text{gcd}(x,y)) = 60
\]
\[
\log_{10} y + 2 \log_{10} (\text{lcm}(x,y)) = 570
\]

we use the properties of logarithms and the relationship between gcd and lcm:

\[
\text{gcd}(x,y) \times \text{lcm}(x,y) = x \times y
\]

rewriting the equations, we get:

\[
x \times (\text{gcd}(x,y))^2 = 10^{60}
\]
\[
y \times (\text{lcm}(x,y))^2 = 10^{570}
\]

let \( d = \text{gcd}(x,y) \). then \( x = d \times a \) and \( y = d \times b \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are coprime. thus:

\[
d^3 a = 10^{60}
\]
\[
d^3 a^2 b^3 = 10^{570}
\]

dividing the second equation by the first:

\[
a b^3 = 10^{510}
\]

substituting \( a = \frac{10^{60}}{d^3} \) into \( a b^3 = 10^{510} \):

\[
\frac{10^{60}}{d^3} \times b^3 = 10^{510}
\]
\[
b^3 = 10^{450} \times d^3
\]
\[
b = 10^{150} \times d
\]

given \( a \) and \( b \) are coprime, we find \( d = 2^{20} \times 5^{20} \), \( a = 1 \), and \( b = 2^{170} \times 5^{170} \). therefore:

\[
x = 2^{20} \times 5^{20}
\]
\[
y = 2^{190} \times 5^{190}
\]

the number of prime factors (counted with multiplicity) for \( x \) is \( 20 + 20 = 40 \) and for \( y \) is \( 190 + 190 = 380 \). thus:

\[
3m + 2n = 3(40) + 2(380) = 120 + 760 = 880
\]

\[
\boxed{880}
\]
