Reasoning: 
So i've got this problem here. it says that there's a function 
f
:
r
→
r
f:r→r with 
f
(
1
)
=
1
f(1)=1, and it satisfies the equation

f
(
x
2
−
y
2
)
=
(
x
−
y
)
(
f
(
x
)
+
f
(
y
)
)
f(x 
2
 −y 
2
 )=(x−y)(f(x)+f(y))
for all real numbers 
x
x and 
y
y. i need to find the number of possible values of 
f
(
2
)
f(2), call that 
n
n, and the sum of all possible values of 
f
(
2
)
f(2), call that 
s
s, and then find 
n
×
s
n×s.

first, i need to understand what this functional equation is telling me. it relates the value of the function at 
x
2
−
y
2
x 
2
 −y 
2
  to the values of the function at 
x
x and 
y
y, scaled by 
(
x
−
y
)
(x−y).

i know that 
x
2
−
y
2
=
(
x
−
y
)
(
x
+
y
)
x 
2
 −y 
2
 =(x−y)(x+y), which is the difference of squares. maybe that can be useful.

given that 
f
(
1
)
=
1
f(1)=1, perhaps i can plug in specific values for 
x
x and 
y
y to find more values of 
f
f.

let me try setting 
y
=
0
y=0. then the equation becomes:

f
(
x
2
−
0
2
)
=
(
x
−
0
)
(
f
(
x
)
+
f
(
0
)
)
f(x 
2
 −0 
2
 )=(x−0)(f(x)+f(0))
simplifying:

f
(
x
2
)
=
x
(
f
(
x
)
+
f
(
0
)
)
f(x 
2
 )=x(f(x)+f(0))
hmm, interesting. so 
f
(
x
2
)
f(x 
2
 ) is expressed in terms of 
f
(
x
)
f(x) and 
f
(
0
)
f(0). i wonder what 
f
(
0
)
f(0) is.

let me try setting 
x
=
y
x=y. then:

f
(
x
2
−
x
2
)
=
(
x
−
x
)
(
f
(
x
)
+
f
(
x
)
)
f(x 
2
 −x 
2
 )=(x−x)(f(x)+f(x))
simplifying:

f
(
0
)
=
0
×
(
2
f
(
x
)
)
f(0)=0×(2f(x))
so 
f
(
0
)
=
0
f(0)=0.

great, so now i know 
f
(
0
)
=
0
f(0)=0.

now, going back to the earlier equation:

f
(
x
2
)
=
x
(
f
(
x
)
+
0
)
=
x
f
(
x
)
f(x 
2
 )=x(f(x)+0)=xf(x)
so 
f
(
x
2
)
=
x
f
(
x
)
f(x 
2
 )=xf(x).

that's a useful relationship.

let me see if i can find 
f
(
−
x
)
f(−x) in terms of 
f
(
x
)
f(x).

let me set 
y
=
−
x
y=−x. then:

f
(
x
2
−
(
−
x
)
2
)
=
(
x
−
(
−
x
)
)
(
f
(
x
)
+
f
(
−
x
)
)
f(x 
2
 −(−x) 
2
 )=(x−(−x))(f(x)+f(−x))
simplifying:

f
(
x
2
−
x
2
)
=
(
x
+
x
)
(
f
(
x
)
+
f
(
−
x
)
)
f(x 
2
 −x 
2
 )=(x+x)(f(x)+f(−x))
so:

f
(
0
)
=
2
x
(
f
(
x
)
+
f
(
−
x
)
)
f(0)=2x(f(x)+f(−x))
but i already know that 
f
(
0
)
=
0
f(0)=0, so:

0
=
2
x
(
f
(
x
)
+
f
(
−
x
)
)
0=2x(f(x)+f(−x))
assuming 
x
≠
0
x

=0, i can divide both sides by 
2
x
2x:

f
(
x
)
+
f
(
−
x
)
=
0
f(x)+f(−x)=0
so 
f
(
−
x
)
=
−
f
(
x
)
f(−x)=−f(x). this means that 
f
f is an odd function.

that's good to know.

now, i need to find 
f
(
2
)
f(2), so maybe i should try to find a general expression for 
f
(
x
)
f(x).

let me consider if 
f
f is a polynomial function. maybe it's a linear function.

assume 
f
(
x
)
=
k
x
f(x)=kx, where 
k
k is a constant.

let's test this assumption.

given 
f
(
1
)
=
1
f(1)=1, so 
k
×
1
=
1
k×1=1, hence 
k
=
1
k=1. so 
f
(
x
)
=
x
f(x)=x.

now, check if this satisfies the functional equation.

left-hand side (lhs):

f
(
x
2
−
y
2
)
=
x
2
−
y
2
f(x 
2
 −y 
2
 )=x 
2
 −y 
2
 
right-hand side (rhs):

(
x
−
y
)
(
f
(
x
)
+
f
(
y
)
)
=
(
x
−
y
)
(
x
+
y
)
=
x
2
−
y
2
(x−y)(f(x)+f(y))=(x−y)(x+y)=x 
2
 −y 
2
 
so, lhs = rhs. therefore, 
f
(
x
)
=
x
f(x)=x is a solution.

but the problem says "possible values of 
f
(
2
)
f(2)", suggesting there might be more than one solution.

is there another function that satisfies the given condition?

maybe 
f
(
x
)
=
0
f(x)=0 for all 
x
x, but wait, 
f
(
1
)
=
1
f(1)=1, so that's not possible.

alternatively, could 
f
(
x
)
f(x) be a higher-degree polynomial?

let me assume 
f
(
x
)
=
k
x
n
f(x)=kx 
n
 , and see what happens.

given 
f
(
1
)
=
1
f(1)=1, so 
k
×
1
n
=
1
k×1 
n
 =1, hence 
k
=
1
k=1, so 
f
(
x
)
=
x
n
f(x)=x 
n
 .

now, plug into the functional equation:

lhs:

f
(
x
2
−
y
2
)
=
(
x
2
−
y
2
)
n
f(x 
2
 −y 
2
 )=(x 
2
 −y 
2
 ) 
n
 
rhs:

(
x
−
y
)
(
f
(
x
)
+
f
(
y
)
)
=
(
x
−
y
)
(
x
n
+
y
n
)
(x−y)(f(x)+f(y))=(x−y)(x 
n
 +y 
n
 )
for these to be equal for all real 
x
x and 
y
y, the expressions must match for all 
x
x and 
y
y.

let me consider specific values to see what 
n
n could be.

first, take 
y
=
0
y=0:

(
x
2
−
0
)
n
=
(
x
−
0
)
(
x
n
+
0
n
)
(x 
2
 −0) 
n
 =(x−0)(x 
n
 +0 
n
 )
x
2
n
=
x
×
x
n
=
x
n
+
1
x 
2n
 =x×x 
n
 =x 
n+1
 
so, 
x
2
n
=
x
n
+
1
x 
2n
 =x 
n+1
  for all 
x
x, which implies 
2
n
=
n
+
1
2n=n+1, so 
n
=
1
n=1.

therefore, the only polynomial solution is 
f
(
x
)
=
x
f(x)=x.

but the problem suggests there might be more solutions, or maybe only this one.

alternatively, perhaps 
f
(
x
)
=
x
f(x)=x is the only solution.

let me try to see if there are any other functions that satisfy the given condition.

suppose that 
f
f is an odd function, as we established earlier.

also, from 
f
(
x
2
)
=
x
f
(
x
)
f(x 
2
 )=xf(x), perhaps i can use this to find 
f
(
2
)
f(2).

wait, 
f
(
x
2
)
=
x
f
(
x
)
f(x 
2
 )=xf(x), so for 
x
=
2
x=2, 
f
(
4
)
=
2
f
(
2
)
f(4)=2f(2).

similarly, for 
x
=
2
x= 
2
​
 , 
f
(
2
)
=
2
f
(
2
)
f(2)= 
2
​
 f( 
2
​
 ).

but this seems like it's getting complicated.

maybe i can try to find a general expression for 
f
(
x
)
f(x).

let me consider expressing 
f
(
x
)
f(x) in terms of another function.

wait, perhaps i can use the fact that 
f
(
x
2
)
=
x
f
(
x
)
f(x 
2
 )=xf(x).

let me try to express 
f
(
x
)
f(x) for positive 
x
x in terms of 
f
(
x
)
f( 
x
​
 ).

wait, if 
x
x is positive, then 
f
(
x
)
=
f
(
(
x
)
2
)
=
x
f
(
x
)
f(x)=f(( 
x
​
 ) 
2
 )= 
x
​
 f( 
x
​
 ).

but i'm not sure if that helps directly.

alternatively, maybe i can consider the function's behavior for positive and negative 
x
x separately.

given that 
f
f is odd, i can focus on 
x
>
0
x>0, and then extend to 
x
<
0
x<0 using 
f
(
−
x
)
=
−
f
(
x
)
f(−x)=−f(x).

let me consider differentiating both sides, but that might be overkill.

alternatively, maybe i can consider specific values to find a pattern.

we know 
f
(
1
)
=
1
f(1)=1.

let me find 
f
(
0
)
f(0), which we already have as 0.

let me find 
f
(
−
1
)
f(−1). since 
f
f is odd, 
f
(
−
1
)
=
−
f
(
1
)
=
−
1
f(−1)=−f(1)=−1.

now, let's find 
f
(
2
)
f(2).

to find 
f
(
2
)
f(2), i need to find a relation that involves 
f
(
2
)
f(2).

let me try to set 
y
=
1
y=1 and 
x
=
2
+
1
x= 
2+1
​
 , but that might not be helpful.

wait, perhaps set 
x
=
2
x=2 and 
y
=
1
y=1, and see what happens.

so, set 
x
=
2
x=2, 
y
=
1
y=1:

f
(
2
2
−
1
2
)
=
(
2
−
1
)
(
f
(
2
)
+
f
(
1
)
)
f(2 
2
 −1 
2
 )=(2−1)(f(2)+f(1))
f
(
4
−
1
)
=
1
×
(
f
(
2
)
+
1
)
f(4−1)=1×(f(2)+1)
f
(
3
)
=
f
(
2
)
+
1
f(3)=f(2)+1
so, 
f
(
3
)
=
f
(
2
)
+
1
f(3)=f(2)+1.

that's one equation involving 
f
(
2
)
f(2) and 
f
(
3
)
f(3).

now, can i find another equation involving 
f
(
3
)
f(3) and maybe 
f
(
2
)
f(2)?

let me set 
x
=
3
x=3, 
y
=
2
y=2:

f
(
3
2
−
2
2
)
=
(
3
−
2
)
(
f
(
3
)
+
f
(
2
)
)
f(3 
2
 −2 
2
 )=(3−2)(f(3)+f(2))
f
(
9
−
4
)
=
1
×
(
f
(
3
)
+
f
(
2
)
)
f(9−4)=1×(f(3)+f(2))
f
(
5
)
=
f
(
3
)
+
f
(
2
)
f(5)=f(3)+f(2)
now, 
f
(
5
)
=
f
(
3
)
+
f
(
2
)
f(5)=f(3)+f(2), and from earlier, 
f
(
3
)
=
f
(
2
)
+
1
f(3)=f(2)+1, so:

f
(
5
)
=
(
f
(
2
)
+
1
)
+
f
(
2
)
=
2
f
(
2
)
+
1
f(5)=(f(2)+1)+f(2)=2f(2)+1
not sure if that helps yet.

let me try another pair. maybe set 
x
=
1
x=1, 
y
=
0
y=0:

f
(
1
2
−
0
2
)
=
(
1
−
0
)
(
f
(
1
)
+
f
(
0
)
)
f(1 
2
 −0 
2
 )=(1−0)(f(1)+f(0))
f
(
1
)
=
1
×
(
1
+
0
)
f(1)=1×(1+0)
1
=
1
1=1
which is just confirming what we already know.

how about setting 
y
=
2
y=2, 
x
=
1
x=1:

f
(
1
2
−
2
2
)
=
(
1
−
2
)
(
f
(
1
)
+
f
(
2
)
)
f(1 
2
 −2 
2
 )=(1−2)(f(1)+f(2))
f
(
1
−
4
)
=
(
−
1
)
(
1
+
f
(
2
)
)
f(1−4)=(−1)(1+f(2))
f
(
−
3
)
=
−
1
−
f
(
2
)
f(−3)=−1−f(2)
but since 
f
f is odd, 
f
(
−
3
)
=
−
f
(
3
)
f(−3)=−f(3), so:

−
f
(
3
)
=
−
1
−
f
(
2
)
−f(3)=−1−f(2)
f
(
3
)
=
1
+
f
(
2
)
f(3)=1+f(2)
which matches what we had earlier.

let me try setting 
x
=
0
x=0, 
y
=
y
y=y:

f
(
0
2
−
y
2
)
=
(
0
−
y
)
(
f
(
0
)
+
f
(
y
)
)
f(0 
2
 −y 
2
 )=(0−y)(f(0)+f(y))
f
(
−
y
2
)
=
−
y
(
0
+
f
(
y
)
)
f(−y 
2
 )=−y(0+f(y))
f
(
−
y
2
)
=
−
y
f
(
y
)
f(−y 
2
 )=−yf(y)
but since 
f
f is odd, 
f
(
−
y
2
)
=
−
f
(
y
2
)
f(−y 
2
 )=−f(y 
2
 ), so:

−
f
(
y
2
)
=
−
y
f
(
y
)
−f(y 
2
 )=−yf(y)
f
(
y
2
)
=
y
f
(
y
)
f(y 
2
 )=yf(y)
which matches the earlier equation 
f
(
x
2
)
=
x
f
(
x
)
f(x 
2
 )=xf(x).

not new information.

maybe i need to consider higher values or look for a pattern.

let me try to find 
f
(
4
)
f(4). using 
f
(
x
2
)
=
x
f
(
x
)
f(x 
2
 )=xf(x), set 
x
=
2
x=2:

f
(
4
)
=
2
f
(
2
)
f(4)=2f(2)
similarly, set 
x
=
3
x=3:

f
(
9
)
=
3
f
(
3
)
=
3
(
f
(
2
)
+
1
)
f(9)=3f(3)=3(f(2)+1)
not sure yet.

alternatively, maybe i can look for a recursive relationship or try to find a general formula.

wait, perhaps i can consider 
y
=
0
y=0, which gave me 
f
(
x
2
)
=
x
f
(
x
)
f(x 
2
 )=xf(x), and i can use this to express 
f
(
x
)
f(x) in terms of 
f
(
x
)
f( 
x
​
 ), but that seems circular.

alternatively, maybe i can consider the ratio 
f
(
x
)
x
x
f(x)
​
 , assuming 
x
≠
0
x

=0.

let me define 
g
(
x
)
=
f
(
x
)
x
g(x)= 
x
f(x)
​
 , for 
x
≠
0
x

=0, and 
g
(
0
)
=
f
′
(
0
)
g(0)=f 
′
 (0) or something, but maybe that's too advanced.

wait, perhaps that's a good approach.

define 
g
(
x
)
=
f
(
x
)
x
g(x)= 
x
f(x)
​
  for 
x
≠
0
x

=0, and 
g
(
0
)
=
0
g(0)=0, since 
f
(
0
)
=
0
f(0)=0.

then, from 
f
(
x
2
)
=
x
f
(
x
)
f(x 
2
 )=xf(x), we have:

f
(
x
2
)
=
x
f
(
x
)
f(x 
2
 )=xf(x)
x
2
g
(
x
2
)
=
x
×
x
g
(
x
)
x 
2
 g(x 
2
 )=x×xg(x)
x
2
g
(
x
2
)
=
x
2
g
(
x
)
x 
2
 g(x 
2
 )=x 
2
 g(x)
g
(
x
2
)
=
g
(
x
)
g(x 
2
 )=g(x)
so, 
g
(
x
2
)
=
g
(
x
)
g(x 
2
 )=g(x) for all 
x
x.

this suggests that 
g
(
x
)
g(x) is a constant function, because 
x
2
x 
2
  can be any non-negative real number, and repeatedly applying this, 
g
(
x
)
=
g
(
x
)
=
g
(
x
)
=
…
g(x)=g( 
x
​
 )=g( 
x
​
 
​
 )=…, which implies 
g
(
x
)
g(x) is constant for 
x
>
0
x>0.

since 
g
(
x
)
g(x) is constant for 
x
>
0
x>0, and 
g
(
−
x
)
=
f
(
−
x
)
−
x
=
−
f
(
x
)
−
x
=
f
(
x
)
x
=
g
(
x
)
g(−x)= 
−x
f(−x)
​
 = 
−x
−f(x)
​
 = 
x
f(x)
​
 =g(x), so 
g
(
x
)
g(x) is even.

therefore, 
g
(
x
)
g(x) is constant for all 
x
≠
0
x

=0, and since 
g
(
0
)
=
0
g(0)=0, but 
g
(
x
)
=
g
(
x
2
)
=
g
(
x
4
)
=
…
g(x)=g(x 
2
 )=g(x 
4
 )=…, implying 
g
(
x
)
g(x) is the same constant for all 
x
x.

therefore, 
g
(
x
)
=
c
g(x)=c, where 
c
c is a constant.

thus, 
f
(
x
)
=
c
x
f(x)=cx for all 
x
x.

now, we know that 
f
(
1
)
=
1
f(1)=1, so:

c
×
1
=
1
c×1=1
c
=
1
c=1
therefore, the only possible function is 
f
(
x
)
=
x
f(x)=x, and hence 
f
(
2
)
=
2
f(2)=2.

but the problem says "possible values of 
f
(
2
)
f(2)", implying there might be multiple solutions, but according to this, there's only one solution.

wait, maybe there are other solutions that are not linear.

is there a possibility that 
f
(
x
)
f(x) is not linear but still satisfies the given condition?

let me assume 
f
(
x
)
=
x
f(x)=x for 
x
≥
0
x≥0 and 
f
(
x
)
=
−
x
f(x)=−x for 
x
<
0
x<0, but that's just the standard linear function extended to negatives, which is still 
f
(
x
)
=
x
f(x)=x.

alternatively, maybe there's a piecewise function that satisfies the condition.

wait, but earlier i derived that 
g
(
x
)
g(x) must be constant, which leads to 
f
(
x
)
=
c
x
f(x)=cx, and with 
f
(
1
)
=
1
f(1)=1, 
c
=
1
c=1, so 
f
(
x
)
=
x
f(x)=x is the only solution.

therefore, there is only one possible value for 
f
(
2
)
f(2), which is 
2
2, so 
n
=
1
n=1, and 
s
=
2
s=2, hence 
n
×
s
=
2
n×s=2.

but just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other functions that could satisfy the condition.

suppose that 
f
(
x
)
=
x
f(x)=x for 
x
≠
a
x

=a, and 
f
(
a
)
f(a) is different, but then plugging into the functional equation might lead to inconsistencies, unless 
a
a is somehow special.

alternatively, maybe there are non-linear functions that satisfy the condition, but from the earlier steps, it seems that 
f
(
x
)
=
c
x
f(x)=cx is the only solution.

therefore, the number of possible values of 
f
(
2
)
f(2) is 
n
=
1
n=1, and the sum of all possible values is 
s
=
2
s=2, so 
n
×
s
=
2
n×s=2.
