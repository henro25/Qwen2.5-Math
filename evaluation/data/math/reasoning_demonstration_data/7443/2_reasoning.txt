Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: i need to find the positive value of 
t
t that satisfies 
a
b
=
t
−
2
i
ab=t−2i, given that 
∣
a
∣
=
2
∣a∣=2 and 
∣
b
∣
=
26
∣b∣= 
26
​	
 . alright, let's break this down.

first off, 
a
a and 
b
b are complex numbers because they're being multiplied to give another complex number 
t
−
2
i
t−2i. so, 
a
a and 
b
b must each have real and imaginary parts.

i know that for any complex number 
z
=
x
+
y
i
z=x+yi, the magnitude 
∣
z
∣
∣z∣ is given by 
x
2
+
y
2
x 
2
 +y 
2
 
​	
 . so, 
∣
a
∣
=
2
∣a∣=2 means that if 
a
=
x
+
y
i
a=x+yi, then 
x
2
+
y
2
=
2
x 
2
 +y 
2
 
​	
 =2, which implies 
x
2
+
y
2
=
4
x 
2
 +y 
2
 =4.

similarly, 
∣
b
∣
=
26
∣b∣= 
26
​	
  means that if 
b
=
u
+
v
i
b=u+vi, then 
u
2
+
v
2
=
26
u 
2
 +v 
2
 
​	
 = 
26
​	
 , so 
u
2
+
v
2
=
26
u 
2
 +v 
2
 =26.

now, the product 
a
b
=
(
x
+
y
i
)
(
u
+
v
i
)
ab=(x+yi)(u+vi). let's multiply that out:

a
b
=
x
u
+
x
v
i
+
y
u
i
+
y
v
i
2
ab=xu+xvi+yui+yvi 
2
 .

since 
i
2
=
−
1
i 
2
 =−1, this simplifies to:

a
b
=
(
x
u
−
y
v
)
+
(
x
v
+
y
u
)
i
ab=(xu−yv)+(xv+yu)i.

according to the problem, this product is equal to 
t
−
2
i
t−2i. so, we can equate the real and imaginary parts:

real part: 
x
u
−
y
v
=
t
xu−yv=t

imaginary part: 
x
v
+
y
u
=
−
2
xv+yu=−2

so now i have a system of two equations:

1. 
x
u
−
y
v
=
t
xu−yv=t

2. 
x
v
+
y
u
=
−
2
xv+yu=−2

but i need to find 
t
t, and i don't know 
x
,
y
,
u
,
v
x,y,u,v. that seems tricky. maybe there's a better way to approach this.

wait a minute, perhaps i can use the magnitudes of 
a
a and 
b
b to find the magnitude of 
a
b
ab, and then relate that to 
t
−
2
i
t−2i.

i recall that the magnitude of the product of two complex numbers is the product of their magnitudes. that is, 
∣
a
b
∣
=
∣
a
∣
⋅
∣
b
∣
∣ab∣=∣a∣⋅∣b∣.

given that 
∣
a
∣
=
2
∣a∣=2 and 
∣
b
∣
=
26
∣b∣= 
26
​	
 , then 
∣
a
b
∣
=
2
×
26
=
2
26
∣ab∣=2× 
26
​	
 =2 
26
​	
 .

on the other hand, 
a
b
=
t
−
2
i
ab=t−2i, so its magnitude is 
∣
t
−
2
i
∣
=
t
2
+
(
−
2
)
2
=
t
2
+
4
∣t−2i∣= 
t 
2
 +(−2) 
2
 
​	
 = 
t 
2
 +4
​	
 .

so, setting these equal:

t
2
+
4
=
2
26
t 
2
 +4
​	
 =2 
26
​	
 

now, i can square both sides to eliminate the square root:

t
2
+
4
=
(
2
26
)
2
t 
2
 +4=(2 
26
​	
 ) 
2
 

calculating the right side:

(
2
26
)
2
=
4
×
26
=
104
(2 
26
​	
 ) 
2
 =4×26=104

so:

t
2
+
4
=
104
t 
2
 +4=104

subtract 4 from both sides:

t
2
=
100
t 
2
 =100

taking the square root of both sides:

t
=
±
10
t=±10

but the problem asks for the positive value of 
t
t, so 
t
=
10
t=10.

wait, but does this satisfy the original equation? let's check.

if 
t
=
10
t=10, then 
a
b
=
10
−
2
i
ab=10−2i, and 
∣
a
b
∣
=
1
0
2
+
(
−
2
)
2
=
100
+
4
=
104
=
2
26
∣ab∣= 
10 
2
 +(−2) 
2
 
​	
 = 
100+4
​	
 = 
104
​	
 =2 
26
​	
 , which matches 
∣
a
∣
⋅
∣
b
∣
∣a∣⋅∣b∣. so it seems correct.

is there anything else i need to consider? maybe the argument of the complex numbers, but the problem only asks for the magnitude-related 
t
t, so i think this is sufficient.

therefore, the positive value of 
t
t is 10.

**final answer**

10
