Answer: Given the problem, we need to find the positive value of \( t \) that satisfies \( ab = t - 2i \) given \( |a| = 2 \) and \( |b| = \sqrt{26} \).

first, we use the property of magnitudes of complex numbers: \( |ab| = |a| \cdot |b| \).

given:
\[ |a| = 2 \]
\[ |b| = \sqrt{26} \]

thus:
\[ |ab| = 2 \times \sqrt{26} = 2\sqrt{26} \]

the magnitude of \( ab \) is also given by:
\[ |t - 2i| = \sqrt{t^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{t^2 + 4} \]

equating the magnitudes:
\[ \sqrt{t^2 + 4} = 2\sqrt{26} \]

squaring both sides:
\[ t^2 + 4 = (2\sqrt{26})^2 \]
\[ t^2 + 4 = 4 \times 26 \]
\[ t^2 + 4 = 104 \]

subtracting 4 from both sides:
\[ t^2 = 100 \]

taking the square root:
\[ t = \pm 10 \]

since we need the positive value:
\[ t = 10 \]

therefore, the positive value of \( t \) is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
