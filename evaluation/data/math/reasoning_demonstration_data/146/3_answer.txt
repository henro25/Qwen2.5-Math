Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the radius \( r \) of the smaller circles given that the largest circle has a radius \( r = 6 \) meters and the smaller circles are arranged such that they are tangent to each other and to the largest circle.

1. the distance between the centers of the largest circle and one of the smaller circles is \( r - r \) because the smaller circle is tangent internally to the largest circle.
2. the distance between the centers of the central smaller circle and one of the outer smaller circles is \( 2r \) because they are tangent to each other.

since the center of the largest circle is also the center of the central smaller circle, we equate the two distances:
\[
2r = r - r
\]
substituting \( r = 6 \) meters:
\[
2r = 6 - r
\]
solving for \( r \):
\[
2r + r = 6 \implies 3r = 6 \implies r = 2
\]

therefore, the radius of each of the five smaller circles is \(\boxed{2}\) meters.
