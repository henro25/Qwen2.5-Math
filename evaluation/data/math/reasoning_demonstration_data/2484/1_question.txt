Problem: Eight circles of diameter 1 are packed in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane as shown. Let region $\mathcal{R}$ be the union of the eight circular regions. Line $l,$ with slope 3, divides $\mathcal{R}$ into two regions of equal area. Line $l$'s equation can be expressed in the form $ax=by+c,$ where $a, b,$ and $c$ are positive integers whose greatest common divisor is 1. Find $a^2+b^2+c^2.$[asy] size(150);defaultpen(linewidth(0.7)); draw((6.5,0)--origin--(0,6.5), Arrows(5)); int[] array={3,3,2}; int i,j; for(i=0; i<3; i=i+1) { for(j=0; j<array[i]; j=j+1) { draw(Circle((1+2*i,1+2*j),1)); }} label("x", (7,0)); label("y", (0,7));[/asy]
