Reasoning: Alright, so I have this problem here: Robert reads 90 pages per hour. How many 270-page books can he read in six hours? Okay, let's see. So, Robert reads at a rate of 90 pages every hour. That seems straightforward enough. Now, I need to figure out how many full books of 270 pages he can get through in six hours.

First, maybe I should find out how many pages he can read in total in six hours. If he reads 90 pages each hour, then in six hours, he would read 90 times 6. Let me calculate that. 90 times 6 is 540 pages. So, in six hours, he can read 540 pages.

Now, each book is 270 pages. So, to find out how many such books he can read, I need to see how many times 270 pages fit into 540 pages. That would be 540 divided by 270. Let's do that. 540 divided by 270 is 2. So, he can read 2 books in six hours.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If he reads 90 pages per hour, in one hour he reads 90 pages. In two hours, that's 180 pages. Three hours would be 270 pages, which is one book. So, in three hours, he finishes one book. Therefore, in six hours, which is double that time, he should finish two books. Yeah, that checks out.

Is there another way to look at it? Maybe by figuring out how much time one book takes and then seeing how many fit into six hours. So, if one book is 270 pages and he reads 90 pages per hour, how many hours does it take to read one book? That would be 270 divided by 90, which is 3 hours per book. So, in six hours, he can read two books. Yep, same answer.

I guess that's pretty straightforward. I don't see any complications here. Maybe I should consider if there are any breaks or if his reading speed changes, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. So, assuming he reads steadily at 90 pages per hour for six hours straight, two books seems correct.

Just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation. Like, could "how many 270-page books can he read in six hours" mean something else? Maybe if the books are of different lengths, but no, they're all 270 pages. So, no confusion there.

Also, making sure that I'm not misreading the numbers. 90 pages per hour, six hours, 270-page books. Yep, that's what I have.

I think I've covered all the bases here. The answer should be 2 books.
