Problem: On the first day, Barry Sotter used his magic wand to make an object's length increase by $\frac{1}{2}$, meaning that if the length of the object was originally $x,$ then it is now $x + \frac{1}{2} x.$  On the second day he increased the object's longer length by $\frac{1}{3}$; on the third day he increased the object's new length by $\frac{1}{4}$; and so on. On the $n^{\text{th}}$ day of performing this trick, Barry will make the object's length exactly 100 times its original length. What is the value of $n$?
