Problem: The coefficients of the polynomial
\[x^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = 0\]are all integers.  Let $n$ be the exact number of integer roots of the polynomial, counting multiplicity.  For example, the polynomial $(x + 3)^2 (x^2 + 4x + 11) = 0$ has two integer roots counting multiplicity, because the root $-3$ is counted twice.

Enter all possible values of $n,$ separated by commas.
