Answer: In 2003, the average monthly rainfall in Mathborough was 41.5 mm. In 2004, the average monthly rainfall was 2 mm more than in 2003, which means the average monthly rainfall in 2004 was 41.5 mm + 2 mm = 43.5 mm.

To find the total rainfall for 2004, multiply the average monthly rainfall by 12:

\[
43.5 \, \text{mm/month} \times 12 \, \text{months} = 522 \, \text{mm}
\]

Thus, the total amount of rain that fell in Mathborough in 2004 was **522 mm**.
