Answer: To determine the fraction of the square quilt that is shaded, we start by analyzing the given asymptote code and visualizing the 3x3 grid of unit squares. each unit square has an area of 1, making the total area of the quilt 9.

we identify the shaded regions based on the paths defined in the asymptote code:

1. the first shaded region is a triangle with vertices (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), which is a right triangle with legs of length 1, so its area is \( \frac{1}{2} \).
2. the second shaded region is a square with vertices (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), which is a 1x1 square, so its area is 1.
3. the third shaded region is a triangle with vertices (1,2), (0,2), (1,3), which is a right triangle with legs of length 1, so its area is \( \frac{1}{2} \).
4. the fourth shaded region is a triangle with vertices (2,1), (2,0), (3,1), which is a right triangle with legs of length 1, so its area is \( \frac{1}{2} \).
5. the fifth shaded region is a triangle with vertices (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), which is a right triangle with legs of length 1, so its area is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

summing up the areas of all shaded regions:
\[
\frac{1}{2} + 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 3
\]

the total area of the quilt is 9, so the fraction of the quilt that is shaded is:
\[
\frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

thus, the fraction of the square quilt that is shaded is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}
\]
