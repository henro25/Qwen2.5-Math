Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: i need to find the base 4 representation of the base 2 number 11011000₂. hmm, base conversions can be a bit tricky, but let's see how to approach this.

first off, i know that base 2 is binary and base 4 is, well, base 4. since 4 is a power of 2 (specifically, 2 squared), there should be a straightforward way to convert from base 2 to base 4 without going through base 10, which would probably be more complicated.

let me recall: in base conversions between powers of the same number, you can group the digits in a certain way. since 4 is 2 squared, i think i can group the binary digits into pairs, starting from the right, because each group of two binary digits will correspond to one base 4 digit.

so, let's take the binary number 11011000₂ and group it into pairs from the right:

11 01 10 00

wait, does that make sense? actually, binary digits are read from right to left, so i should make sure i'm grouping them correctly. let me double-check: the rightmost pair is 00, then 10, then 01, and finally 11.

so, the groups are:

11 01 10 00

now, i need to convert each of these binary pairs into their base 4 equivalents. let's recall the binary to decimal conversions for 2-bit numbers:

00 in binary is 0 in decimal.

01 in binary is 1 in decimal.

10 in binary is 2 in decimal.

11 in binary is 3 in decimal.

since base 4 digits range from 0 to 3, this should directly map to base 4.

so, converting each pair:

11 in binary is 3 in base 4.

01 in binary is 1 in base 4.

10 in binary is 2 in base 4.

00 in binary is 0 in base 4.

therefore, putting it all together, the base 4 number should be 3120₄.

wait a minute, let me verify that. maybe i should check by converting both the original binary number and my base 4 result to base 10 and see if they match.

first, let's convert 11011000₂ to base 10.

starting from the right, the positions are:

2⁷ 2⁶ 2⁵ 2⁴ 2³ 2² 2¹ 2⁰

so, 1*2⁷ + 1*2⁶ + 0*2⁵ + 1*2⁴ + 1*2³ + 0*2² + 0*2¹ + 0*2⁰

calculating each term:

1*128 = 128

1*64 = 64

0*32 = 0

1*16 = 16

1*8 = 8

0*4 = 0

0*2 = 0

0*1 = 0

adding them up: 128 + 64 = 192, plus 16 is 208, plus 8 is 216.

so, 11011000₂ is 216 in base 10.

now, let's convert my base 4 number, 3120₄, to base 10 to see if it matches.

the positions in base 4 are:

4³ 4² 4¹ 4⁰

so, 3*4³ + 1*4² + 2*4¹ + 0*4⁰

calculating each term:

3*64 = 192

1*16 = 16

2*4 = 8

0*1 = 0

adding them up: 192 + 16 = 208, plus 8 is 216.

perfect, it matches the base 10 equivalent of the original binary number. so, 3120₄ is indeed the correct base 4 representation of 11011000₂.

alternatively, just to be thorough, i could have converted the binary number to base 4 by another method, perhaps by first converting to base 10 and then to base 4, but that seems more time-consuming and unnecessary since grouping the binary digits directly into base 4 is straightforward.

let me try that alternative method quickly to confirm.

first, convert 11011000₂ to base 10, which we already did and got 216.

now, convert 216 from base 10 to base 4.

to do this, i need to divide the number by 4 and keep track of the remainders.

216 divided by 4 is 54 with a remainder of 0.

54 divided by 4 is 13 with a remainder of 2.

13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1.

3 divided by 4 is 0 with a remainder of 3.

now, reading the remainders from bottom to top, i get 3120₄, which matches what i got earlier by grouping the binary digits.

so, both methods confirm that the base 4 representation is 3120₄.

therefore, the final answer is 3120₄.

**final answer**

3120 
4
