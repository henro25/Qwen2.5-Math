Answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the number of ordered triples \((a_1, a_2, a_3)\) where each \(a_i\) is an integer between 1 and 10, and the sequence generated by the rule \(a_n = a_{n-1} \cdot |a_{n-2} - a_{n-3}|\) for \(n \geq 4\) eventually includes a zero.

first, we note that a term \(a_n\) becomes zero if either \(a_{n-1} = 0\) or \(a_{n-2} = a_{n-3}\). since \(a_1, a_2, a_3\) are all between 1 and 10, they cannot be zero initially.

we consider the conditions under which the sequence hits zero:
1. if \(a_2 = a_1\), then \(a_4 = 0\).
2. if \(a_3 = a_2\), then \(a_5 = 0\).
3. if \(|a_2 - a_1| = 1\), then \(a_6 = 0\).

to find the number of triples where the sequence never hits zero, we need:
- \(a_2 \neq a_1\)
- \(a_3 \neq a_2\)
- \(|a_2 - a_1| \neq 1\)

we calculate the number of such triples:
- for each \(a_1\), the forbidden values for \(a_2\) are \(a_1 - 1\), \(a_1\), and \(a_1 + 1\) (if within 1 to 10).
- for \(a_1 = 1\) or \(10\), there are 2 forbidden values for \(a_2\), giving 8 choices.
- for \(a_1 = 2\) to \(9\), there are 3 forbidden values for \(a_2\), giving 7 choices.

thus, the total number of valid \((a_1, a_2)\) pairs is:
\[
(2 \times 8) + (8 \times 7) = 16 + 56 = 72
\]

for each valid \((a_1, a_2)\) pair, \(a_3\) can be any of 10 values except \(a_2\), giving 9 choices.

therefore, the number of triples where the sequence never hits zero is:
\[
72 \times 9 = 648
\]

the total number of ordered triples is \(10^3 = 1000\). thus, the number of triples where the sequence hits zero is:
\[
1000 - 648 = 352
\]

therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{352}
\]
