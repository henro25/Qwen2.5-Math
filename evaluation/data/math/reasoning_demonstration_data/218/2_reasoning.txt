Reasoning: So i have this problem here: let 
f
(
n
)
f(n) be the sum of all the divisors of a positive integer 
n
n. if 
f
(
f
(
n
)
)
=
n
+
2
f(f(n))=n+2, then call 
n
n superdeficient. i need to find out how many superdeficient positive integers there are.

first, i need to understand what 
f
(
n
)
f(n) represents. it's the sum of all positive divisors of 
n
n, including 1 and 
n
n itself. for example, if 
n
=
6
n=6, its divisors are 1, 2, 3, and 6, so 
f
(
6
)
=
1
+
2
+
3
+
6
=
12
f(6)=1+2+3+6=12.

the condition given is 
f
(
f
(
n
)
)
=
n
+
2
f(f(n))=n+2. that means if i apply the function 
f
f twice, the result should be equal to 
n
+
2
n+2.

my goal is to find all positive integers 
n
n that satisfy this condition.

let me start by considering small values of 
n
n and see if any of them satisfy the condition.

let's try 
n
=
1
n=1:

- divisors of 1: 1

- 
f
(
1
)
=
1
f(1)=1

- 
f
(
f

=
f
(

)
=

f(f(1))=f(1)=1

- 
n
+
2
=
1
+
2
=
3
n+2=1+2=3

- 
1
≠
3
1

=3, so 1 is not superdeficient.

next, 
n
=
2
n=2:

- divisors of 2: 1, 2

- 
f
(
2
)
=
1
+
2
=
3
f(2)=1+2=3

- divisors of 3: 1, 3

- 
f
(
f
(
2
)
)
=
f
(
3
)
=
1
+
3
=
4
f(f(2))=f(3)=1+3=4

- 
n
+
2
=
2
+
2
=
4
n+2=2+2=4

- 
4
=
4
4=4, so 2 is superdeficient.

okay, so 2 is a superdeficient number.

now, 
n
=
3
n=3:

- divisors of 3: 1, 3

- 
f
(
3
)
=

f(3)=1+3=4

- divisors of 4: 1, 2, 4

- 
f
(
f

=
f
(
4

f(f(3))=f(4)=1+2+4=7

- 
n

n+2=3+2=5

- 
7

7

=5, so 3 is not superdeficient.

next, 
n
=
4
n=4:

- divisors of 4: 1, 2, 4

- 
f
(
4
)
=
1
+
2

f(4)=1+2+4=7

- divisors of 7: 1, 7

- 
f

f(f(4))=f(7)=1+7=8

n+2=4+2=6

n+2=5+2=7

so far, only

n=2 satisfies the condition. let's try

so, up to 
n
=
10
n=10, only 
n
=
2
n=2 works. maybe there are more larger numbers that satisfy the condition. but checking each one manually would take too much time. i need a better approach.

let me consider the properties of 
f
(
n
)
f(n). 
f
(
n
)
f(n) is known as the sigma function, and it's multiplicative. that means that if 
n
n can be factored into primes as 
n
=
p
1
a
1
p
2
a
2
…
p
k
a
k
n=p 
1
a 
1
​
 
​
 p 
2
a 
2
​
 
​
 …p 
k
a 
k
​
 
​
 , then:

f
(
n
)
=
∏
i
=
1
k
(
p
i
a
i
+
1
−
1
p
i
−
1
)
f(n)= 
i=1
∏
k
​
 ( 
p 
i
​
 −1
p 
i
a 
i
​
 +1
​
 −1
​
 )
but i'm not sure if that helps directly here. maybe i can think about the relationship between 
f
(
n
)
f(n) and 
n
n.

given that 
f
(
f
(
n
)
)
=
n
+
2
f(f(n))=n+2, perhaps i can express 
f
(
n
)
f(n) in terms of 
n
n. let me denote 
m
=
f
(
n
)
m=f(n), so the equation becomes 
f
(
m
)
=
n
+
2
f(m)=n+2.

so, 
f
(
m
)
=
n
+
2
f(m)=n+2, and 
m
=
f
(
n
)
m=f(n).

this seems a bit circular. maybe i can look for numbers where 
f
(
n
)
f(n) is related to 
n
n in a specific way.

let me consider the case where 
n
n is prime. if 
n
n is prime, then its divisors are 1 and 
n
n, so 
f
(
n
)
=
1
+
n
f(n)=1+n.

then, 
f
(
f
(
n
)
)
=
f
(
n
+
1
)
f(f(n))=f(n+1).

we need 
f
(
n
+
1
)
=
n
+
2
f(n+1)=n+2.

so, for prime 
n
n, we have 
f
(
n
+
1
)
=
n
+
2
f(n+1)=n+2.

but 
f
(
n
+
1
)
f(n+1) is the sum of divisors of 
n
+
1
n+1. for this to be equal to 
n
+
2
n+2, 
n
+
1
n+1 must be such that the sum of its divisors is 
n
+
2
n+2.

let's see what this implies. the sum of divisors of a number is at least 1 plus the number itself. so, 
f
(
k
)
≥
1
+
k
f(k)≥1+k for any 
k
≥
1
k≥1, with equality if and only if 
k
=
1
k=1 or 
k
k is prime.

wait, for 
k
=
1
k=1, 
f
(
1
)
=
1
f(1)=1, which is less than 
1
+
1
=
2
1+1=2, but for 
k
≥
2
k≥2, 
f
(
k
)
≥
1
+
k
f(k)≥1+k, with equality if and only if 
k
k is prime.

so, 
f
(
k
)
=
1
+
k
f(k)=1+k if and only if 
k
k is prime or 
k
=
1
k=1.

but 
k
=
1
k=1 gives 
f
(
1
)
=
1
f(1)=1, which is not equal to 
1
+
1
=
2
1+1=2, so only primes satisfy 
f
(
k
)
=
1
+
k
f(k)=1+k.

therefore, for prime 
n
n, 
f
(
n
+
1
)
=
n
+
2
f(n+1)=n+2 implies that 
n
+
1
n+1 is prime, because only then 
f
(
n
+
1
)
=
1
+
(
n
+
1
)
=
n
+
2
f(n+1)=1+(n+1)=n+2.

so, for prime 
n
n, 
n
+
1
n+1 must also be prime for 
f
(
f
(
n
)
)
=
n
+
2
f(f(n))=n+2.

in other words, both 
n
n and 
n
+
1
n+1 are prime. but wait, the only two consecutive integers that are both prime are 2 and 3, because any even number greater than 2 is not prime.

so, the only case where both 
n
n and 
n
+
1
n+1 are prime is 
n
=
2
n=2, since 
n
+
1
=
3
n+1=3, which is prime.

this matches what i found earlier, where 
n
=
2
n=2 is superdeficient.

now, what if 
n
n is not prime? let's consider composite numbers.

let me take 
n
=
4
n=4, which is composite. earlier, i saw that 
f
(
f
(
4
)
)
=
8
f(f(4))=8, while 
n
+
2
=
6
n+2=6, so it doesn't satisfy the condition.

another composite number, 
n
=
6
n=6:

- 
f
(
6
)
=
12
f(6)=12

- 
f
(
12
)
=
28
f(12)=28

- 
n
+
2
=
8
n+2=8

- 
28
≠
8
28

=8, so it doesn't work.

n
=
8
n=8:

- 
f
(
8
)
=
15
f(8)=15

- 
f
(
15
)
=
24
f(15)=24

- 
n
+
2
=
10
n+2=10

- 
24
≠
10
24

=10, so no.

n
=
9
n=9:

- 
f
(
9
)
=
13
f(9)=13

- 
f
(
13
)
=
14
f(13)=14

- 
n
+
2
=
11
n+2=11

- 
14
≠
11
14

=11, no.

n
=
10
n=10:

- 
f
(
10
)
=
18
f(10)=18

- 
f
(
18
)
=
39
f(18)=39

- 
n
+
2
=
12
n+2=12

- 
39
≠
12
39

=12, no.

hmm, none of these work. maybe superdeficient numbers are rare, and perhaps only 
n
=
2
n=2 satisfies the condition.

but to be thorough, let's consider the general properties.

given that 
f
(
f
(
n
)
)
=
n
+
2
f(f(n))=n+2, and 
f
(
n
)
f(n) is the sum of divisors of 
n
n, which is always greater than or equal to 
n
+
1
n+1 for 
n
>
1
n>1, because 
1
1 and 
n
n are always divisors.

wait, actually, for 
n
=
1
n=1, 
f
(
1
)
=
1
f(1)=1, which is less than 
1
+
1
=
2
1+1=2. for 
n
=
2
n=2, 
f
(
2
)
=
3
f(2)=3, which is greater than 
2
+
1
=
3
2+1=3. for 
n
=
3
n=3, 
f
(
3
)
=
4
f(3)=4, which is greater than 
3
+
1
=
4
3+1=4, and so on.

in general, for 
n
≥
2
n≥2, 
f
(
n
)
≥
n
+
1
f(n)≥n+1, with equality if and only if 
n
n is prime.

wait, but for 
n
=
2
n=2, 
f
(
2
)
=
3
=
2
+
1
f(2)=3=2+1, and for 
n
=
3
n=3, 
f
(
3
)
=
4
=
3
+
1
f(3)=4=3+1, but for 
n
=
4
n=4, 
f
(
4
)
=
7
>
4
+
1
=
5
f(4)=7>4+1=5, and so on.

actually, for any prime 
p
p, 
f
(
p
)
=
p
+
1
f(p)=p+1, and for composite 
n
n, 
f
(
n
)
>
n
+
1
f(n)>n+1.

so, in the case where 
n
n is prime, 
f
(
n
)
=
n
+
1
f(n)=n+1, and 
f
(
f
(
n
)
)
=
f
(
n
+
1
)
f(f(n))=f(n+1).

we need 
f
(
n
+
1
)
=
n
+
2
f(n+1)=n+2, which, as established earlier, implies that 
n
+
1
n+1 is prime, because only then 
f
(
n
+
1
)
=
(
n
+
1
)
+
1
=
n
+
2
f(n+1)=(n+1)+1=n+2.

therefore, both 
n
n and 
n
+
1
n+1 must be prime. the only such case is 
n
=
2
n=2, since 2 is prime and 3 is prime, but for any 
n
>
2
n>2, 
n
n and 
n
+
1
n+1 cannot both be prime because one of them is even and greater than 2, hence not prime.

therefore, 
n
=
2
n=2 is the only prime that satisfies the condition.

now, what about composite numbers? let's assume 
n
n is composite, so 
f
(
n
)
>
n
+
1
f(n)>n+1.

then, 
f
(
f
(
n
)
)
f(f(n)) would be at least 
f
(
n
+
1
)
f(n+1), but since 
n
n is composite, 
f
(
n
)
f(n) is at least 
n
+
1
+
d
n+1+d, where 
d
d is some divisor greater than 1.

wait, perhaps i need to find a lower bound for 
f
(
f
(
n
)
)
f(f(n)).

given that 
n
n is composite, 
f
(
n
)
≥
n
+
1
+
d
f(n)≥n+1+d, where 
d
d is the smallest prime divisor of 
n
n, perhaps.

but this seems complicated. maybe i can consider that for composite 
n
n, 
f
(
n
)
f(n) is significantly larger than 
n
+
1
n+1, making 
f
(
f
(
n
)
)
f(f(n)) much larger than 
n
+
2
n+2, so it's unlikely to satisfy 
f
(
f
(
n
)
)
=
n
+
2
f(f(n))=n+2.

given that, and since only 
n
=
2
n=2 satisfies the condition among primes, and no composite number seems to satisfy it based on the examples i've checked, perhaps 
n
=
2
n=2 is the only superdeficient positive integer.

to confirm this, let's consider that for 
n
≥
3
n≥3, if 
n
n is composite, 
f
(
n
)
f(n) is at least 
n
+
1
+
d
n+1+d, where 
d
d is a divisor of 
n
n greater than 1.

for example, 
n
=
4
n=4, 
f
(
4
)
=
1
+
2
+
4
=
7
f(4)=1+2+4=7, which is 
4
+
3
4+3, where 2 is a divisor greater than 1.

then 
f
(
f
(
n
)
)
=
f
(
7
)
=
8
f(f(n))=f(7)=8, which is 
4
+
4
4+4, which is greater than 
4
+
2
=
6
4+2=6.

similarly, 
n
=
6
n=6, 
f
(
6
)
=
12
f(6)=12, 
f
(
12
)
=
28
f(12)=28, which is much larger than 
6
+
2
=
8
6+2=8.

so, it seems that for composite 
n
n, 
f
(
f
(
n
)
)
f(f(n)) grows much faster than 
n
+
2
n+2, making the equality unlikely.

therefore, the only superdeficient positive integer is 
n
=
2
n=2.
