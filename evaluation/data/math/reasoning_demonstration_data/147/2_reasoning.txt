Reasoning: So i've got this problem here about a car traveling from point a to point b and back, and i need to find the speed on the return trip. let's see.

first, the car goes from a to b, which is 120 miles, at 60 miles per hour. then it comes back the same 120 miles, but at a different speed that i need to find. the average rate for the whole round trip is given as 45 miles per hour.

okay, i know that average speed for a round trip isn't just the average of the two speeds; it's actually the total distance divided by the total time. so, i need to find the total distance and the total time.

total distance is easy: 120 miles going to b plus 120 miles coming back to a, so that's 240 miles in total.

now, the average speed is 45 mph, and average speed is total distance divided by total time. so, i can set up the equation:

45 = 240 / total time

from this, i can solve for total time:

total time = 240 / 45

let me calculate that. 240 divided by 45 is... let's see, 45 times 5 is 225, and 45 times 5.333... is 240. so, total time is 5 and 1/3 hours, or 5 hours and 20 minutes.

wait, let me double-check that. 45 times 5 is 225, plus 45 times 1/3 is 15, so yes, 225 plus 15 is 240. so, total time is 5 and 1/3 hours.

now, i need to find the time taken for each leg of the trip. the trip from a to b is 120 miles at 60 mph, so time is distance over speed, which is 120 / 60 = 2 hours.

so, time going to b is 2 hours, and time coming back is what's left from the total time.

total time is 5 and 1/3 hours, which is 5.333... hours.

so, time coming back is 5.333... minus 2, which is 3.333... hours.

now, the distance back is 120 miles, and the time is 3.333... hours. so, speed is distance over time, which is 120 / 3.333... let's calculate that.

120 divided by 3.333... is the same as 120 divided by (10/3), which is 120 * (3/10) = 36.

so, the speed on the return trip is 36 mph.

wait a minute, does that make sense? let me check.

if going to b takes 2 hours, and coming back takes 3.333... hours, total time is indeed 5.333... hours, and total distance is 240 miles.

average speed is total distance over total time, which is 240 / 5.333... = 45 mph, which matches the given average speed.

so, it seems correct.

alternatively, i could use the harmonic mean formula for average speed for a round trip, which is 2ab / (a + b), where a and b are the speeds going and coming back.

in this case, a is 60 mph, and b is what we're trying to find, and the average speed is 45 mph.

so, setting up the equation:

2 * 60 * b / (60 + b) = 45

now, solve for b.

first, multiply both sides by (60 + b):

2 * 60 * b = 45 * (60 + b)

simplify:

120b = 45 * 60 + 45b

120b = 2700 + 45b

subtract 45b from both sides:

120b - 45b = 2700

75b = 2700

divide both sides by 75:

b = 2700 / 75 = 36

again, i get 36 mph for the return trip speed.

this matches my earlier calculation, so it seems consistent.

therefore, the speed on the return trip is 36 miles per hour.

**final answer**
