Problem: In triangle $ABC$, $AB$ is congruent to $AC$, the measure of angle $ABC$ is $72^{\circ}$ and segment $BD$ bisects angle $ABC$ with point $D$ on side $AC$. If point $E$ is on side $BC$ such that segment $DE$ is parallel to side $AB$, and point $F$ is on side $AC$ such that segment $EF$ is parallel to segment $BD$, how many isosceles triangles are in the figure shown?
