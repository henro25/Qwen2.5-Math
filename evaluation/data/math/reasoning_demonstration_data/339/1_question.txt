Problem: A basement has a 24-foot by 32-foot rectangular floor. The basement is flooded with water to a depth of 18 inches. Three pumps are used to pump the water out of the basement.  Each  pump will pump 8 gallons of water per minute.  If a cubic foot of water contains 7.5 gallons, how many minutes will it take  to pump all of the water out of the basement using the three  pumps?
