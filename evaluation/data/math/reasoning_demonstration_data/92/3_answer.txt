Answer: To simplify the expression \(\sin (x - y) \cos y + \cos (x - y) \sin y\), we can use the sine addition formula:

\[
\sin(a + b) = \sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b
\]

let \(a = x - y\) and \(b = y\). then the expression becomes:

\[
\sin((x - y) + y) = \sin(x - y) \cos y + \cos(x - y) \sin y
\]

simplifying the left side:

\[
\sin((x - y) + y) = \sin(x)
\]

thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\sin(x)
\]

therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\sin x}
\]
