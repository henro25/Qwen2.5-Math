Reasoning: So i have this expression to simplify: sin(x - y) * cos y + cos(x - y) * sin y. hmm, that looks a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe there's a trigonometric identity that can help me simplify it.

let me recall some trigonometric identities. there's the sine addition formula, which is sin(a + b) = sin a cos b + cos a sin b. wait a minute, that looks similar to what i have here. in my expression, i have sin(x - y) * cos y + cos(x - y) * sin y. if i think of (x - y) as 'a' and y as 'b', then my expression becomes sin(a) * cos(b) + cos(a) * sin(b), which is exactly the sine addition formula for sin(a + b). so, sin(a + b) = sin(x - y + y) = sin(x).

wait, so does that mean my original expression simplifies to sin(x)? that seems too straightforward. let me double-check to make sure i didn't make a mistake.

let's substitute a = x - y and b = y into the sine addition formula:

sin(a + b) = sin(a)cos(b) + cos(a)sin(b)

plugging in a and b:

sin((x - y) + y) = sin(x - y)cos(y) + cos(x - y)sin(y)

simplifying the left side:

sin(x - y + y) = sin(x)

so, sin(x - y)cos(y) + cos(x - y)sin(y) = sin(x)

yep, that checks out. it looks like the expression simplifies to sin(x). i think that's the answer.

just to be thorough, maybe i can try plugging in some values for x and y to see if both sides are equal. let's say x = 45 degrees and y = 30 degrees.

first, calculate sin(x - y)cos(y) + cos(x - y)sin(y):

x - y = 45 - 30 = 15 degrees

sin(15°)cos(30°) + cos(15°)sin(30°)

i know that sin(15°) ≈ 0.2588, cos(30°) ≈ 0.8660, cos(15°) ≈ 0.9659, sin(30°) = 0.5

so, 0.2588 * 0.8660 + 0.9659 * 0.5 ≈ 0.2231 + 0.4830 = 0.7061

now, sin(x) = sin(45°) ≈ 0.7071

these are very close, considering the rounding errors in the sine and cosine values. so, it seems like the simplification is correct.

alternatively, i could use radians for a more precise check. let's try x = π/3 radians (60 degrees) and y = π/6 radians (30 degrees).

x - y = π/3 - π/6 = π/6 radians

sin(π/6)cos(π/6) + cos(π/6)sin(π/6)

sin(π/6) = 0.5, cos(π/6) = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

so, 0.5 * 0.8660 + 0.8660 * 0.5 = 0.4330 + 0.4330 = 0.8660

now, sin(x) = sin(π/3) = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

again, both sides are equal, which reinforces that the simplification is correct.

i think i've got it. the expression simplifies to sin(x).
