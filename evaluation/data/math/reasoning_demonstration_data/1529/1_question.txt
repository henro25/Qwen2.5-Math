Problem: Let $f(x) = x^2 + ax + b$ and $g(x) = x^2 + cx + d$ be two distinct polynomials with real coefficients such that the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of $f$ is a root of $g,$ and the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of $g$ is a root of $f,$ and both $f$ and $g$ have the same minimum value.  If the graphs of the two polynomials intersect at the point $(100,-100),$ what is the value of $a + c$?
