Answer: Let \( A \) represent the number of pennies Alex currently has and \( B \) represent the number of pennies Bob currently has.

### Step 1: Set up the equations based on the given conditions.

1. **If Alex gives Bob a penny:**
   - Alex will have \( A - 1 \) pennies.
   - Bob will have \( B + 1 \) pennies.
   - According to the problem: \( B + 1 = 3(A - 1) \).

2. **If Bob gives Alex a penny:**
   - Alex will have \( A + 1 \) pennies.
   - Bob will have \( B - 1 \) pennies.
   - According to the problem: \( B - 1 = 2(A + 1) \).

### Step 2: Solve the system of equations.

From the first equation:
\[
B + 1 = 3(A - 1)
\]
\[
B + 1 = 3A - 3
\]
\[
B = 3A - 4
\]

Substitute \( B = 3A - 4 \) into the second equation:
\[
(3A - 4) - 1 = 2(A + 1)
\]
\[
3A - 5 = 2A + 2
\]
\[
A = 7
\]

Now substitute \( A = 7 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[
B = 3(7) - 4
\]
\[
B = 21 - 4
\]
\[
B = 17
\]

### Step 3: Verify the solution.

1. **Alex gives Bob a penny:**
   - Alex: \( 7 - 1 = 6 \) pennies.
   - Bob: \( 17 + 1 = 18 \) pennies.
   - Check: \( 18 = 3 \times 6 \), which holds true.

2. **Bob gives Alex a penny:**
   - Alex: \( 7 + 1 = 8 \) pennies.
   - Bob: \( 17 - 1 = 16 \) pennies.
   - Check: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \), which also holds true.

### Conclusion:
Bob currently has **17 pennies**.
