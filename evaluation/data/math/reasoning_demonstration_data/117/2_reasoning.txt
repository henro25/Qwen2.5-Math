Reasoning: Okay, let's see. I've got this problem here: "If Alex gives Bob a penny, Bob will have three times as many pennies as Alex has. If Bob gives Alex a penny, Bob will have twice as many pennies as Alex has. How many pennies does Bob currently have?"

Alright, so I need to find out how many pennies Bob has right now. There are two scenarios given: one where Alex gives Bob a penny, and another where Bob gives Alex a penny. In each case, there's a relationship between the number of pennies they have after the transaction.

First, I should probably define some variables to represent the current number of pennies each person has. Let's say:

Let A = the number of pennies Alex currently has.

Let B = the number of pennies Bob currently has.

Now, in the first scenario, Alex gives Bob a penny. So after this transaction:

Alex will have A - 1 pennies.

Bob will have B + 1 pennies.

And according to the problem, at this point, Bob has three times as many pennies as Alex. So:

B + 1 = 3 * (A - 1)

Okay, that's one equation.

In the second scenario, Bob gives Alex a penny. So after this transaction:

Alex will have A + 1 pennies.

Bob will have B - 1 pennies.

And in this case, Bob has twice as many pennies as Alex. So:

B - 1 = 2 * (A + 1)

Alright, now I have two equations:

1) B + 1 = 3(A - 1)

2) B - 1 = 2(A + 1)

I need to solve these two equations to find the values of A and B, but the question specifically asks for the number of pennies Bob currently has, which is B.

So, I need to solve this system of equations to find B.

Let me see, I can use substitution or elimination. Maybe substitution would be easier here.

From equation 1:

B + 1 = 3A - 3

So, B = 3A - 3 - 1

B = 3A - 4

Now, I can substitute this expression for B into equation 2.

Equation 2: B - 1 = 2(A + 1)

Substitute B:

(3A - 4) - 1 = 2(A + 1)

Simplify:

3A - 5 = 2A + 2

Now, subtract 2A from both sides:

A - 5 = 2

Add 5 to both sides:

A = 7

Now that I have A, I can plug it back into the expression for B.

B = 3A - 4

B = 3*7 - 4

B = 21 - 4

B = 17

So, Bob currently has 17 pennies.

Wait a minute, let me double-check that.

If Alex has 7 pennies and Bob has 17 pennies:

First scenario: Alex gives Bob a penny.

Alex: 7 - 1 = 6

Bob: 17 + 1 = 18

Is 18 three times 6? Yes, because 3*6=18.

Second scenario: Bob gives Alex a penny.

Alex: 7 + 1 = 8

Bob: 17 - 1 = 16

Is 16 twice 8? Yes, because 2*8=16.

Okay, that seems to check out.

But just to be thorough, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using ratios or something else?

Well, in the first scenario, after Alex gives Bob a penny, Bob has three times as many as Alex.

So, the ratio of Bob's pennies to Alex's pennies is 3:1.

Similarly, in the second scenario, after Bob gives Alex a penny, the ratio is 2:1.

I wonder if I can set up ratios directly.

Let me try that.

Let A be Alex's current pennies, B be Bob's current pennies.

After Alex gives Bob a penny:

Alex: A - 1

Bob: B + 1

And B + 1 = 3(A - 1)

Which is the same as the first equation I had.

After Bob gives Alex a penny:

Alex: A + 1

Bob: B - 1

And B - 1 = 2(A + 1)

Same as the second equation.

So, it seems like the system of equations is the best way to go.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the difference in their pennies.

Let me see.

Suppose I consider the difference between Bob's and Alex's pennies.

Let D = B - A

Then, in the first scenario, after Alex gives Bob a penny:

Alex: A - 1

Bob: B + 1

So, difference: (B + 1) - (A - 1) = B + 1 - A + 1 = B - A + 2 = D + 2

And according to the problem, Bob has three times as many as Alex at this point.

So, B + 1 = 3(A - 1)

Which is the same as before.

Not sure if this helps.

Maybe I can try expressing everything in terms of D.

But perhaps that's more complicated.

I think the initial approach with the two equations is the most straightforward.

So, in conclusion, Bob has 17 pennies.
