Answer: To find the length of the diagonal \( da \) in the regular hexagon, we start by understanding the properties of a regular hexagon. in a regular hexagon with side length \( s \):

- the shorter diagonal (connecting two vertices with one vertex in between) is \( s\sqrt{3} \).
- the longer diagonal (connecting two opposite vertices) is \( 2s \).

given the coordinates of points \( a \) and \( d \):
- \( a \) is at \( (1,0) \)
- \( d \) is at \( (1,3.464) \)

the distance between \( a \) and \( d \) is calculated as:
\[
da = \sqrt{(1-1)^2 + (3.464-0)^2} = \sqrt{0 + (3.464)^2} = 3.464
\]

recognizing that \( 3.464 \) is approximately \( 2\sqrt{3} \), we confirm that \( da \) is a shorter diagonal. therefore, the length of \( da \) is:
\[
da = 2\sqrt{3}
\]

thus, the length of the diagonal \( da \) is:
\[
\boxed{2\sqrt{3}}
\]
