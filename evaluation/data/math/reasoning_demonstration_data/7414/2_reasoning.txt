Reasoning: So i've got this problem here. it says to express √x divided by √y as a common fraction, and it gives me this equation:

(
1
2
)
2
+
(
1
3
)
2
(
1
4
)
2
+
(
1
5
)
2
=
13
x
41
y
( 
4
1
​	
 ) 
2
 +( 
5
1
​	
 ) 
2
 
( 
2
1
​	
 ) 
2
 +( 
3
1
​	
 ) 
2
 
​	
 = 
41y
13x
​	
 
okay, first things first, i need to simplify the left side of this equation. let's start by calculating each of those squares.

so, 
(
1
2
)
2
( 
2
1
​	
 ) 
2
  is 
1
4
4
1
​	
 , and 
(
1
3
)
2
( 
3
1
​	
 ) 
2
  is 
1
9
9
1
​	
 . adding those together gives me 
1
4
+
1
9
4
1
​	
 + 
9
1
​	
 . to add these fractions, i need a common denominator, which would be 36. so, 
1
4
4
1
​	
  is 
9
36
36
9
​	
  and 
1
9
9
1
​	
  is 
4
36
36
4
​	
 . adding them up, i get 
13
36
36
13
​	
 .

now, for the denominator of the big fraction, we have 
(
1
4
)
2
+
(
1
5
)
2
( 
4
1
​	
 ) 
2
 +( 
5
1
​	
 ) 
2
 , which is 
1
16
+
1
25
16
1
​	
 + 
25
1
​	
 . again, i need a common denominator, which is 400 in this case. so, 
1
16
16
1
​	
  is 
25
400
400
25
​	
  and 
1
25
25
1
​	
  is 
16
400
400
16
​	
 . adding those gives me 
41
400
400
41
​	
 .

so now, the left side of the equation simplifies to:

13
36
41
400
=
13
x
41
y
400
41
​	
 
36
13
​	
 
​	
 = 
41y
13x
​	
 
dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so this becomes:

13
36
×
400
41
=
13
x
41
y
36
13
​	
 × 
41
400
​	
 = 
41y
13x
​	
 
multiplying the numerators and denominators, i get:

13
×
400
36
×
41
=
13
x
41
y
36×41
13×400
​	
 = 
41y
13x
​	
 
simplifying the left side, 13 times 400 is 5200, and 36 times 41 is 1476. so:

5200
1476
=
13
x
41
y
1476
5200
​	
 = 
41y
13x
​	
 
hmm, that seems a bit messy. maybe i can simplify 
5200
1476
1476
5200
​	
  before setting it equal to 
13
x
41
y
41y
13x
​	
 .

let's see, both 5200 and 1476 are divisible by 4. so, dividing numerator and denominator by 4:

5200 ÷ 4 = 1300

1476 ÷ 4 = 369

so, 
1300
369
=
13
x
41
y
369
1300
​	
 = 
41y
13x
​	
 

still, i need to solve for x and y. maybe i can cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions.

cross-multiplying gives:

13x * 369 = 1300 * 41y

simplify both sides:

13x * 369 = 1300 * 41y

let's compute 13 * 369 and 1300 * 41.

13 * 369: 10 * 369 = 3690, 3 * 369 = 1107, so total is 3690 + 1107 = 4797.

1300 * 41: 1300 * 40 = 52,000 and 1300 * 1 = 1,300, so total is 53,300.

so, 4797x = 53,300y

now, i need to solve for x and y. it seems like i have one equation with two variables, which typically means there are infinitely many solutions. but since the original problem asks for √x / √y, maybe i can express x in terms of y or vice versa.

let me try to solve for x in terms of y.

from 4797x = 53,300y, i can write:

x = (53,300 / 4797) y

hmm, that fraction can be simplified. let's see if 53,300 and 4797 have any common factors.

first, let's find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 53,300 and 4797.

i'll use the euclidean algorithm:

gcd(53,300, 4797)

53,300 ÷ 4797 = 11 times 4797 is 52,767, remainder is 533.

now, gcd(4797, 533)

4797 ÷ 533 = 9 times 533 is 4797, remainder is 0.

so, gcd is 533.

therefore, 53,300 ÷ 533 = 100

4797 ÷ 533 = 9

so, x = (100 / 9) y

now, i need to find √x / √y.

√x / √y = √(x / y) = √(100 / 9) = √(100) / √(9) = 10 / 3

so, the answer should be 10/3.

wait, does that make sense? let me check my steps again.

starting from:

(
1
2

2

(

(

​	
 ) 
2
 +( 
3
1
​	
 ) 
2
 
​	
 = 
41y
13x
​	
 
i simplified the left side to 
13
36
×
400
41
=
5200
1476
36
13
​	
 × 
41
400
​	
 = 
1476
5200
​	
 , which simplifies to 
1300
369
369
1300
​	
 .

then, setting 
1300
369
=
13
x
41
y
369
1300
​	
 = 
41y
13x
​	
 , cross-multiplied to get 4797x = 53,300y, and then simplified to x = (100 / 9)y.

then, √x / √y = √(100 / 9) = 10 / 3.

that seems correct. maybe i should check if there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.

alternatively, perhaps i can express x and y in terms of each other from the beginning.

given:

(

2
 +(

​	
 ) 
2
 
​	
 = 
41y
13x
​	
 
we already found that the left side simplifies to 
1300
369
369
1300
​	
 , and set it equal to 
13
x
41
y
41y
13x
​	
 .

cross-multiplying, we have 13x * 369 = 1300 * 41y, which simplifies to x / y = 100 / 9, as before.

therefore, √x / √y = √(100 / 9) = 10 / 3.

so, yes, i believe the answer is 10/3.

**final answer**
