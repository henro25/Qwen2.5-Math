Reasoning: Let's dive into this problem. so, we have a 12-hour clock, and we're talking about "clock equivalent" times. from the example given, 4 hours is clock equivalent to its square, which is 16 hours. but on a 12-hour clock, 16 hours is the same as 4 hours because 16 - 12 = 4. so, 16 mod 12 is 4, which matches the original 4 hours. cool, that makes sense.

now, the question is asking for the least whole number of hours greater than 4 that is clock equivalent to its square number of hours. so, we need to find the smallest integer n > 4 such that n is congruent to n² modulo 12. in other words, n ≡ n² (mod 12).

alright, let's think about how to approach this. we need to find n where n² - n is divisible by 12. so, n² - n ≡ 0 mod 12.

let me factor that: n(n - 1) ≡ 0 mod 12. so, the product of n and (n - 1) is divisible by 12.

since n and n - 1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime, meaning they share no common factors other than 1. that means one of them must be divisible by 4 and the other by 3, or one by 12, but since they are consecutive, one being divisible by 12 would suffice, but that's a specific case.

wait, but 4 and 3 are factors of 12, and since n and n-1 are consecutive, they don't share any prime factors. so, for their product to be divisible by 12, one must be divisible by 4 and the other by 3, or vice versa.

so, let's consider that.

case 1: n is divisible by 4, and n - 1 is divisible by 3.

case 2: n is divisible by 3, and n - 1 is divisible by 4.

let me set up some equations for these cases.

for case 1:

n ≡ 0 mod 4

n - 1 ≡ 0 mod 3 ⇒ n ≡ 1 mod 3

so, n ≡ 0 mod 4 and n ≡ 1 mod 3.

similarly, for case 2:

n ≡ 0 mod 3

n - 1 ≡ 0 mod 4 ⇒ n ≡ 1 mod 4

so, n ≡ 0 mod 3 and n ≡ 1 mod 4.

now, i need to find the smallest n > 4 that satisfies either of these two sets of congruences.

let me start with case 1: n ≡ 0 mod 4 and n ≡ 1 mod 3.

i can use the chinese remainder theorem here since 4 and 3 are coprime.

so, find n such that n ≡ 0 mod 4 and n ≡ 1 mod 3.

let me express n as 4k for some integer k.

then, 4k ≡ 1 mod 3 ⇒ 4k mod 3 ≡ 1 ⇒ (since 4 mod 3 is 1), so 1*k ≡ 1 mod 3 ⇒ k ≡ 1 mod 3.

so, k = 3m + 1 for some integer m.

therefore, n = 4k = 4*(3m + 1) = 12m + 4.

so, the solutions for case 1 are n = 12m + 4, where m is a non-negative integer.

now, for m = 0, n = 4, which is our starting point, but we need n > 4.

so, m = 1: n = 12*1 + 4 = 16.

but wait, on a 12-hour clock, 16 hours is equivalent to 4 hours, which we already have.

so, n = 16 is equivalent to n = 4, but we need a different n > 4.

so, let's try m = 2: n = 12*2 + 4 = 28.

now, 28 mod 12 is 4 again. hmm, that's not helpful. it seems like all n = 12m + 4 will cycle back to 4 on a 12-hour clock.

so, maybe case 1 doesn't give us a new solution greater than 4 that isn't equivalent to 4 on the clock.

let's move to case 2: n ≡ 0 mod 3 and n ≡ 1 mod 4.

again, since 3 and 4 are coprime, we can apply the chinese remainder theorem.

express n as 3k for some integer k.

then, 3k ≡ 1 mod 4 ⇒ 3k mod 4 ≡ 1.

since 3 mod 4 is 3, we have 3k ≡ 1 mod 4 ⇒ multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 3 mod 4.

the inverse of 3 mod 4 is 3, because 3*3 = 9 ≡ 1 mod 4.

so, k ≡ 3*1 ≡ 3 mod 4 ⇒ k = 4m + 3 for some integer m.

therefore, n = 3k = 3*(4m + 3) = 12m + 9.

so, the solutions for case 2 are n = 12m + 9, where m is a non-negative integer.

now, for m = 0, n = 9.

let's check if n = 9 satisfies the original condition: n ≡ n² mod 12.

compute n²: 9² = 81.

now, 81 mod 12: 81 / 12 = 6*12 = 72, remainder 9. so, 81 mod 12 is 9.

and n = 9, so indeed, 9 ≡ 81 mod 12.

great, so n = 9 satisfies the condition.

now, is there a smaller n > 4 that satisfies the condition?

let's check n = 5.

n = 5, n² = 25.

25 mod 12 is 1, since 2*12 = 24, remainder 1.

but 5 ≡ 1 mod 12? no, 5 ≠ 1, so n = 5 doesn't work.

n = 6:

n = 6, n² = 36.

36 mod 12 is 0.

6 ≡ 0 mod 12? no, 6 ≠ 0.

n = 7:

n² = 49.

49 mod 12: 4*12 = 48, remainder 1. so, 49 mod 12 is 1.

7 ≡ 1 mod 12? no.

n = 8:

n² = 64.

64 mod 12: 5*12 = 60, remainder 4. so, 64 mod 12 is 4.

8 ≡ 4 mod 12? no.

n = 9:

we already checked, and it works.

n = 10:

n² = 100.

100 mod 12: 8*12 = 96, remainder 4. so, 100 mod 12 is 4.

10 ≡ 4 mod 12? no.

n = 11:

n² = 121.

121 mod 12: 10*12 = 120, remainder 1. so, 121 mod 12 is 1.

11 ≡ 1 mod 12? no.

n = 12:

n² = 144.

144 mod 12 is 0.

12 ≡ 0 mod 12. yes, but 12 is equivalent to 0 on a 12-hour clock, which is not greater than 4.

also, 12 is greater than 4, but does it satisfy n ≡ n² mod 12?

yes, 12 ≡ 0 mod 12 and 144 ≡ 0 mod 12.

but 12 is equivalent to 0 on the clock, and since we're looking for greater than 4, and 0 is less than 4, perhaps 12 is acceptable.

but wait, the problem says greater than 4, so 12 is greater than 4.

however, earlier, n = 9 also satisfies the condition, and it's less than 12.

so, between 9 and 12, 9 is smaller, so 9 would be the answer.

but let's confirm if there are any other n between 4 and 9 that satisfy the condition.

we've already checked n = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

only n = 9 satisfies it.

therefore, the least whole number of hours greater than 4 that is clock equivalent to its square number of hours is 9.

**final answer**
