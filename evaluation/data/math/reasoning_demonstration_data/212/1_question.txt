Problem: On a $12$-hour clock, an elapsed time of four hours looks the same as an elapsed time of $16$ hours. Because of this, we can say that four hours is "clock equivalent'' to its square number of hours. What is the least whole number of hours that is greater than $4$ hours and is "clock equivalent'' to its square number of hours?
