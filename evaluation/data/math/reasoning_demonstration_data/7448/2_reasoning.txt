Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: i need to find the sum of all three-digit positive integers with three distinct digits and then find the remainder when that sum is divided by 1000. hmm, okay, let's break this down.

first, let's understand what three-digit numbers with distinct digits look like. a three-digit number ranges from 100 to 999. for the digits to be distinct, no digit repeats. so, for example, 121 wouldn't count because the digit '1' repeats, but 123 would be fine.

i think the best way to approach this is to consider how many such numbers there are and then find a way to sum them up efficiently. calculating each number individually and adding them up would be too time-consuming, especially since there are quite a few of them.

let's start by figuring out how many three-digit numbers have all distinct digits.

the first digit (the hundreds place) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it can't be 0), and it has to be unique. so, there are 9 choices for the first digit.

the second digit (the tens place) can be any digit from 0 to 9 except the one used in the hundreds place. so, there are 9 choices here as well.

the third digit (the units place) can be any digit from 0 to 9 except the two already used in the hundreds and tens places. so, there are 8 choices for the third digit.

therefore, the total number of such three-digit numbers is 9 (hundreds) * 9 (tens) * 8 (units) = 648.

now, i need to find the sum of all these 648 numbers. that sounds tricky, but maybe there's a pattern or a formula i can use.

let's think about the contribution of each digit place separately.

first, consider the hundreds place. each digit from 1 to 9 appears in the hundreds place a certain number of times. since there are 9 choices for the hundreds digit, and for each choice, there are 9 * 8 = 72 combinations for the tens and units digits, each digit from 1 to 9 appears in the hundreds place 72 times.

so, the total sum contributed by the hundreds place is:

sum_hundreds = (sum of digits from 1 to 9) * 72 * 100

the sum of digits from 1 to 9 is (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9) = 45.

therefore, sum_hundreds = 45 * 72 * 100.

let me calculate that:

45 * 72 = 3240

3240 * 100 = 324,000

okay, that's the total contribution from the hundreds place.

next, the tens place. the digits in the tens place can be from 0 to 9, but they have to be different from the hundreds digit. for each hundreds digit (1-9), there are 9 choices for the tens digit (0-9 excluding the hundreds digit), and for each of those, there are 8 choices for the units digit.

wait, but earlier i thought that for each hundreds digit, there are 9 choices for tens and 8 for units, totaling 72 numbers per hundreds digit.

but when considering the tens digit across all numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 (excluding the hundreds digit) appears equally often.

actually, to find the total contribution from the tens place, i can think similarly to the hundreds place.

for the tens place, digits can be 0-9, but not the same as the hundreds digit.

how many times does each digit from 0 to 9 appear in the tens place?

let's fix a digit d (from 0 to 9) and see how many times it appears in the tens place.

if d is 0:

- hundreds digit can be 1-9 (9 choices)

- units digit can be anything except hundreds digit and 0, so 8 choices

- so, 9 * 8 = 72 numbers where tens digit is 0

if d is from 1 to 9:

- hundreds digit can be 1-9 excluding d, so 8 choices

- units digit can be anything except hundreds digit and d, so 8 choices

- so, 8 * 8 = 64 numbers where tens digit is d

therefore, the sum contributed by the tens place is:

sum_tens = (0 * 72 + sum from d=1 to 9 of d * 64) * 10

let's calculate sum from d=1 to 9 of d * 64:

sum = 64 * (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 9) = 64 * 45 = 2880

so, sum_tens = (0 + 2880) * 10 = 28,800

alright, moving on to the units place.

similar to the tens place, but with some differences.

for the units place, digits can be 0-9, but not equal to the hundreds or tens digits.

let's find out how many times each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the units place.

if d is 0:

- hundreds digit: 1-9 (9 choices)

- tens digit: 1-9 excluding hundreds digit (8 choices)

- so, 9 * 8 = 72 numbers where units digit is 0

if d is from 1 to 9:

- hundreds digit: 1-9 excluding d (8 choices)

- tens digit: 0-9 excluding hundreds digit and d (8 choices)

- so, 8 * 8 = 64 numbers where units digit is d

therefore, the sum contributed by the units place is:

sum_units = (0 * 72 + sum from d=1 to 9 of d * 64) * 1

we already calculated sum from d=1 to 9 of d * 64 = 2880

so, sum_units = (0 + 2880) * 1 = 2,880

now, the total sum s is the sum of sum_hundreds, sum_tens, and sum_units:

s = 324,000 + 28,800 + 2,880 = 355,680

but the problem asks for the remainder when s is divided by 1000.

so, i need to find s mod 1000.

to find 355,680 mod 1000, i can look at the last three digits of s.

355,680 → last three digits are 680.

therefore, 355,680 mod 1000 is 680.

so, the remainder is 680.

wait a minute, but i recall that in modular arithmetic, the remainder should be less than 1000, and 680 is less than 1000, so that should be fine.

alternatively, i can confirm by dividing 355,680 by 1000.

355,680 ÷ 1000 = 355 with a remainder of 680.

yes, that matches.

so, the remainder when s is divided by 1000 is 680.

**final answer**

680
