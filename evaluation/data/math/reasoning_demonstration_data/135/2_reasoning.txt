Reasoning: So i've got this equation to solve: 
x
3
+
(
x
+
1
)
3
+
(
x
+
2
)
3
=
(
x
+
3
)
3
x 
3
 +(x+1) 
3
 +(x+2) 
3
 =(x+3) 
3
 . i need to find all real solutions for 
x
x. hmm, let's see how to approach this.

first off, i know that expanding these cubes might be a bit tedious, but it's probably the way to go. maybe if i expand each term separately and then combine like terms, i can simplify the equation.

let's start by expanding each cubic term.

the first term is 
x
3
x 
3
 , which is already expanded.

next is 
(
x
+
1
)
3
(x+1) 
3
 . i recall that 
(
a
+
b
)
3
=
a
3
+
3
a
2
b
+
3
a
b
2
+
b
3
(a+b) 
3
 =a 
3
 +3a 
2
 b+3ab 
2
 +b 
3
 . so applying that here:

(
x
+
1
)
3
=
x
3
+
3
x
2
(
1
)
+
3
x
(
1
)
2
+
1
3
=
x
3
+
3
x
2
+
3
x
+
1
(x+1) 
3
 =x 
3
 +3x 
2
 (1)+3x(1) 
2
 +1 
3
 =x 
3
 +3x 
2
 +3x+1.

similarly, 
(
x
+
2
)
3
=
x
3
+
3
x
2
(
2
)
+
3
x
(
2
)
2
+
2
3
=
x
3
+
6
x
2
+
12
x
+
8
(x+2) 
3
 =x 
3
 +3x 
2
 (2)+3x(2) 
2
 +2 
3
 =x 
3
 +6x 
2
 +12x+8.

and 
(
x
+
3
)
3
=
x
3
+
3
x
2
(
3
)
+
3
x
(
3
)
2
+
3
3
=
x
3
+
9
x
2
+
27
x
+
27
(x+3) 
3
 =x 
3
 +3x 
2
 (3)+3x(3) 
2
 +3 
3
 =x 
3
 +9x 
2
 +27x+27.

now, plugging these back into the original equation:

x
3
+
(
x
3
+
3
x
2
+
3
x
+
1
)
+
(
x
3
+
6
x
2
+
12
x
+
8
)
=
x
3
+
9
x
2
+
27
x
+
27
x 
3
 +(x 
3
 +3x 
2
 +3x+1)+(x 
3
 +6x 
2
 +12x+8)=x 
3
 +9x 
2
 +27x+27.

let's combine like terms on the left side:

x
3
+
x
3
+
3
x
2
+
3
x
+
1
+
x
3
+
6
x
2
+
12
x
+
8
=
3
x
3
+
9
x
2
+
15
x
+
9
x 
3
 +x 
3
 +3x 
2
 +3x+1+x 
3
 +6x 
2
 +12x+8=3x 
3
 +9x 
2
 +15x+9.

so now the equation is:

3
x
3
+
9
x
2
+
15
x
+
9
=
x
3
+
9
x
2
+
27
x
+
27
3x 
3
 +9x 
2
 +15x+9=x 
3
 +9x 
2
 +27x+27.

hmm, let's subtract the right side from both sides to bring everything to one side:

3
x
3
+
9
x
2
+
15
x
+
9
−
x
3
−
9
x
2
−
27
x
−
27
=
0
3x 
3
 +9x 
2
 +15x+9−x 
3
 −9x 
2
 −27x−27=0.

simplifying that:

2
x
3
−
12
x
−
18
=
0
2x 
3
 −12x−18=0.

alright, so now i have a cubic equation: 
2
x
3
−
12
x
−
18
=
0
2x 
3
 −12x−18=0.

i can try to simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 2 to make the coefficients smaller:

x
3
−
6
x
−
9
=
0
x 
3
 −6x−9=0.

now, i need to solve this cubic equation. cubic equations can be tricky, but maybe i can find rational roots using the rational root theorem.

the rational root theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms 
p
q
q
p
​
 , has 
p
p as a factor of the constant term and 
q
q as a factor of the leading coefficient.

in this case, the constant term is -9 and the leading coefficient is 1. so possible rational roots are 
±
1
,
±
3
,
±
9
±1,±3,±9.

let's test these possible roots.

first, test 
x
=
1
x=1:

1
3
−
6
(
1
)
−
9
=
1
−
6
−
9
=
−
14
≠
0
1 
3
 −6(1)−9=1−6−9=−14

=0.

not a root.

next, 
x
=
−
1
x=−1:

(
−
1
)
3
−
6
(
−
1
)
−
9
=
−
1
+
6
−
9
=
−
4
≠
0
(−1) 
3
 −6(−1)−9=−1+6−9=−4

=0.

not a root.

next, 
x
=
3
x=3:

3
3
−
6
(
3
)
−
9
=
27
−
18
−
9
=
0
3 
3
 −6(3)−9=27−18−9=0.

hey, that works! so 
x
=
3
x=3 is a root.

since 
x
=
3
x=3 is a root, i can factor the cubic as 
(
x
−
3
)
(
x
2
+
a
x
+
b
)
=
x
3
−
6
x
−
9
(x−3)(x 
2
 +ax+b)=x 
3
 −6x−9.

let's find 
a
a and 
b
b.

expanding 
(
x
−
3
)
(
x
2
+
a
x
+
b
)
=
x
3
+
a
x
2
+
b
x
−
3
x
2
−
3
a
x
−
3
b
(x−3)(x 
2
 +ax+b)=x 
3
 +ax 
2
 +bx−3x 
2
 −3ax−3b.

combining like terms: 
x
3
+
(
a
−
3
)
x
2
+
(
b
−
3
a
)
x
−
3
b
x 
3
 +(a−3)x 
2
 +(b−3a)x−3b.

this should equal 
x
3
−
6
x
−
9
x 
3
 −6x−9.

so, matching coefficients:

1. 
a
−
3
=
0
a−3=0 ⇒ 
a
=
3
a=3

2. 
b
−
3
a
=
−
6
b−3a=−6 ⇒ 
b
−
9
=
−
6
b−9=−6 ⇒ 
b
=
3
b=3

3. 
−
3
b
=
−
9
−3b=−9 ⇒ 
b
=
3
b=3 (consistent with above)

so the quadratic factor is 
x
2
+
3
x
+
3
x 
2
 +3x+3.

now, the equation factors to 
(
x
−
3
)
(
x
2
+
3
x
+
3
)
=
0
(x−3)(x 
2
 +3x+3)=0.

setting each factor to zero:

1. 
x
−
3
=
0
x−3=0 ⇒ 
x
=
3
x=3

2. 
x
2
+
3
x
+
3
=
0
x 
2
 +3x+3=0

for the quadratic equation 
x
2
+
3
x
+
3
=
0
x 
2
 +3x+3=0, i can use the quadratic formula:

x
=
−
b
±
b
2
−
4
a
c
2
a
x= 
2a
−b± 
b 
2
 −4ac
​
 
​
 , where 
a
=
1
a=1, 
b
=
3
b=3, and 
c
=
3
c=3.

plugging in:

x
=
−
3
±
9
−
12
2
=
−
3
±
−
3
2
x= 
2
−3± 
9−12
​
 
​
 = 
2
−3± 
−3
​
 
​
 .

since the discriminant is negative (
−
3
−3
​
 ), there are no real solutions from this quadratic factor.

therefore, the only real solution is 
x
=
3
x=3.

wait a minute, is there a possibility i made a mistake somewhere? let me double-check my steps.

first, the expansion of each cubic term seems correct.

then, combining like terms on the left side: 
x
3
+
(
x
3
+
3
x
2
+
3
x
+
1
)
+
(
x
3
+
6
x
2
+
12
x
+
8
)
=
3
x
3
+
9
x
2
+
15
x
+
9
x 
3
 +(x 
3
 +3x 
2
 +3x+1)+(x 
3
 +6x 
2
 +12x+8)=3x 
3
 +9x 
2
 +15x+9. that looks good.

subtracting the right side: 
3
x
3
+
9
x
2
+
15
x
+
9
−
(
x
3
+
9
x
2
+
27
x
+
27
)
=
2
x
3
−
12
x
−
18
=
0
3x 
3
 +9x 
2
 +15x+9−(x 
3
 +9x 
2
 +27x+27)=2x 
3
 −12x−18=0. that also seems correct.

dividing by 2: 
x
3
−
6
x
−
9
=
0
x 
3
 −6x−9=0. correct.

testing possible rational roots: 
x
=
3
x=3 works, and the quadratic factor gives no real roots. so, 
x
=
3
x=3 is the only real solution.

i think that's it.

**final answer**
