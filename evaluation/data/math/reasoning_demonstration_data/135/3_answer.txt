Answer: To solve the equation \( x^3 + (x+1)^3 + (x+2)^3 = (x+3)^3 \), we start by expanding each cubic term:

\[
(x+1)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1
\]
\[
(x+2)^3 = x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8
\]
\[
(x+3)^3 = x^3 + 9x^2 + 27x + 27
\]

substituting these into the original equation:

\[
x^3 + (x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1) + (x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8) = x^3 + 9x^2 + 27x + 27
\]

combining like terms on the left side:

\[
3x^3 + 9x^2 + 15x + 9 = x^3 + 9x^2 + 27x + 27
\]

subtracting the right side from both sides:

\[
3x^3 + 9x^2 + 15x + 9 - x^3 - 9x^2 - 27x - 27 = 0
\]

simplifying:

\[
2x^3 - 12x - 18 = 0
\]

dividing by 2:

\[
x^3 - 6x - 9 = 0
\]

using the rational root theorem, we test possible rational roots and find that \( x = 3 \) is a root. factoring the cubic equation:

\[
(x - 3)(x^2 + 3x + 3) = 0
\]

solving the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 3x + 3 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 12}}{2} = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2}
\]

since the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions from the quadratic factor. therefore, the only real solution is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]
