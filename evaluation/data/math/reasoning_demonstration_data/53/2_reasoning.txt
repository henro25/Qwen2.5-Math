Reasoning: So i have this problem here: "two distinct positive integers from 1 to 50 inclusive are chosen. let the sum of the integers equal s and the product equal p. what is the probability that p + s is one less than a multiple of 5?"

first, i need to understand what is being asked. i have to choose two distinct integers between 1 and 50, calculate their sum (s) and product (p), and then check if p + s is one less than a multiple of 5. i need to find the probability of this happening.

so, probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

first, i need to find the total number of ways to choose two distinct integers from 1 to 50. that's a combination problem, specifically "50 choose 2", which is calculated as:

total ways
=
(
50
2
)
=
50
×
49
2
=
1225
total ways=( 
2
50
​
 )= 
2
50×49
​
 =1225
so, there are 1225 possible pairs.

next, i need to find the number of pairs where p + s is one less than a multiple of 5. in other words, p + s ≡ -1 mod 5, which is the same as p + s ≡ 4 mod 5, because -1 and 4 are congruent modulo 5.

so, i need to find pairs (a, b) where a ≠ b, and p + s = a*b + a + b ≡ 4 mod 5.

let me see if i can simplify a*b + a + b.

i can factor this expression:

a*b + a + b = a*(b + 1) + b = b*(a + 1) + a

hmm, that doesn't seem particularly helpful. maybe i can factor it differently.

wait a minute, a*b + a + b can be rewritten as (a + 1)*(b + 1) - 1.

let me check that:

(a + 1)*(b + 1) = a*b + a + b + 1

so, (a + 1)*(b + 1) - 1 = a*b + a + b + 1 - 1 = a*b + a + b, which matches.

so, p + s = (a + 1)*(b + 1) - 1

therefore, p + s + 1 = (a + 1)*(b + 1)

so, p + s ≡ 4 mod 5 implies that (a + 1)*(b + 1) ≡ 0 mod 5, because p + s + 1 ≡ 0 mod 5.

wait, no. if p + s ≡ 4 mod 5, then p + s + 1 ≡ 0 mod 5, so (a + 1)*(b + 1) ≡ 0 mod 5.

therefore, (a + 1)*(b + 1) is a multiple of 5.

so, for the product of (a + 1) and (b + 1) to be a multiple of 5, at least one of (a + 1) or (b + 1) must be a multiple of 5.

in other words, either a ≡ -1 mod 5, which is a ≡ 4 mod 5, or b ≡ -1 mod 5, which is b ≡ 4 mod 5.

therefore, to have p + s ≡ 4 mod 5, at least one of the numbers a or b must be congruent to 4 mod 5.

wait a second, is that correct? let me double-check.

if (a + 1)*(b + 1) ≡ 0 mod 5, then indeed, either a + 1 ≡ 0 mod 5 or b + 1 ≡ 0 mod 5, which implies a ≡ -1 mod 5 or b ≡ -1 mod 5, which is a ≡ 4 mod 5 or b ≡ 4 mod 5.

so, i need to find the number of pairs where at least one of the numbers is congruent to 4 mod 5.

now, how many numbers between 1 and 50 are congruent to 4 mod 5?

let's see: numbers congruent to 4 mod 5 in 1 to 50 are: 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29, 34, 39, 44, 49.

so, there are 10 such numbers.

therefore, there are 10 numbers a where a ≡ 4 mod 5.

similarly, there are 10 numbers b where b ≡ 4 mod 5.

now, to find the number of pairs where at least one is ≡4 mod 5, i can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

the number of pairs where at least one is ≡4 mod 5 is equal to:

(number of pairs where a ≡4 mod5) + (number of pairs where b ≡4 mod5) - (number of pairs where both a and b ≡4 mod5)

but since the pairs are unordered, i need to be careful.

alternatively, it's easier to calculate the total number of pairs minus the number of pairs where neither a nor b is ≡4 mod5.

so, total pairs: 1225

number of pairs where neither a nor b is ≡4 mod5: number of choices where both a and b are not ≡4 mod5.

there are 50 - 10 = 40 numbers not ≡4 mod5.

so, number of such pairs is c(40,2) = (40*39)/2 = 780.

therefore, number of pairs where at least one is ≡4 mod5 is 1225 - 780 = 445.

therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 445.

hence, the probability is 445 / 1225.

now, i can simplify this fraction.

first, divide numerator and denominator by 5:

445 ÷ 5 = 89

1225 ÷ 5 = 245

so, 89/245.

is this reducible further? let's check.

find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 89 and 245.

89 is a prime number, i believe.

yes, 89 is a prime number.

does 89 divide 245?

245 ÷ 89 is approximately 2.75, and 89*2=178, 245-178=67, which is not zero.

therefore, gcd is 1, so 89/245 is already in simplest terms.

alternatively, i can express it as a decimal.

89 ÷ 245 ≈ 0.36329...

so, approximately 36.33%.

but the problem likely expects the answer in fraction form.

therefore, the probability is 89/245.

wait a minute, but let me double-check everything to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

first, total pairs: c(50,2)=1225. that seems correct.

numbers ≡4 mod5 from 1 to 50: 4,9,14,19,24,29,34,39,44,49. that's 10 numbers. correct.

pairs where at least one is ≡4 mod5: total pairs minus pairs where neither is ≡4 mod5.

number not ≡4 mod5: 40 numbers.

pairs where neither is ≡4 mod5: c(40,2)=780.

therefore, pairs where at least one is ≡4 mod5: 1225-780=445.

probability: 445/1225=89/245.

seems correct.

alternatively, maybe i should consider if there are any overlapping cases or if there's another way to approach this.

wait, perhaps there is a different way to look at this.

let me see: p + s = a*b + a + b.

let me see if there's another way to interpret p + s ≡4 mod5.

alternatively, perhaps considering the properties of numbers modulo 5.

but i think the approach i took is correct.

alternatively, perhaps i can think in terms of residues modulo 5.

since we're dealing with modulo 5, perhaps considering the residues of a and b modulo 5.

let me try that.

let me consider a ≡ m mod5 and b ≡ n mod5, where m and n are from 0 to 4, and m ≠ n since a ≠ b.

then, p + s = a*b + a + b ≡ m*n + m + n mod5.

and we want p + s ≡4 mod5.

so, m*n + m + n ≡4 mod5.

let me see for each possible pair (m,n), with m ≠ n, whether m*n + m + n ≡4 mod5.

let me make a table for m and n from 0 to 4, excluding m=n.

compute m*n + m + n for each pair.

let's list all possible (m,n) pairs where m ≠ n:

(0,1): 0*1 + 0 + 1 = 1 ≡1 mod5 ≠4

(0,2): 0*2 + 0 + 2 = 2 ≡2 mod5 ≠4

(0,3): 0*3 + 0 + 3 = 3 ≡3 mod5 ≠4

(0,4): 0*4 + 0 + 4 = 4 ≡4 mod5 ✓

(1,0): 1*0 + 1 + 0 =1 ≡1 mod5 ≠4

(1,2):1*2 +1 +2=2+1+2=5≡0 mod5 ≠4

(1,3):1*3 +1 +3=3+1+3=7≡2 mod5 ≠4

(1,4):1*4 +1 +4=4+1+4=9≡4 mod5 ✓

(2,0):2*0 +2 +0=0+2+0=2≡2 mod5 ≠4

(2,1):2*1 +2 +1=2+2+1=5≡0 mod5 ≠4

(2,3):2*3 +2 +3=6+2+3=11≡1 mod5 ≠4

(2,4):2*4 +2 +4=8+2+4=14≡4 mod5 ✓

(3,0):3*0 +3 +0=0+3+0=3≡3 mod5 ≠4

(3,1):3*1 +3 +1=3+3+1=7≡2 mod5 ≠4

(3,2):3*2 +3 +2=6+3+2=11≡1 mod5 ≠4

(3,4):3*4 +3 +4=12+3+4=19≡4 mod5 ✓

(4,0):4*0 +4 +0=0+4+0=4≡4 mod5 ✓

(4,1):4*1 +4 +1=4+4+1=9≡4 mod5 ✓

(4,2):4*2 +4 +2=8+4+2=14≡4 mod5 ✓

(4,3):4*3 +4 +3=12+4+3=19≡4 mod5 ✓

so, the pairs (m,n) where m*n + m + n ≡4 mod5 are:

(0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)

wait, but in the table above, i have:

(0,4): ✓

(1,4): ✓

(2,4): ✓

(3,4): ✓

(4,0): ✓

(4,1): ✓

(4,2): ✓

(4,3): ✓

so, total of 8 possible pairs where m*n + m + n ≡4 mod5.

now, considering that m and n are residues modulo 5, and a and b are distinct integers from 1 to 50.

now, for each residue m, how many numbers a in 1 to 50 have a ≡m mod5?

for m=0: numbers divisible by 5: 5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50 → 10 numbers

m=1: 1,6,11,16,21,26,31,36,41,46 → 10 numbers

m=2: 2,7,12,17,22,27,32,37,42,47 → 10 numbers

m=3: 3,8,13,18,23,28,33,38,43,48 → 10 numbers

m=4: 4,9,14,19,24,29,34,39,44,49 → 10 numbers

so, 10 numbers for each residue.

now, for each of the favorable (m,n) pairs, we can calculate the number of (a,b) pairs.

but since a and b are distinct, and unordered, i need to be careful about overcounting.

let me list the favorable (m,n) pairs:

(0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)

wait, but (0,4) and (4,0) are essentially the same in terms of unordered pairs.

similarly, (1,4) and (4,1), etc.

so, actually, there are 4 unique unordered pairs:

{0,4}, {1,4}, {2,4}, {3,4}

because {4,0} is the same as {0,4}, and so on.

now, for each of these, i can calculate the number of (a,b) pairs.

first, {0,4}: a ≡0 mod5 and b≡4 mod5, or a≡4 mod5 and b≡0 mod5.

but since the pairs are unordered, it's just the number of ways to choose one a ≡0 and one b≡4.

number of ways: 10 (for a≡0) * 10 (for b≡4) = 100.

similarly, {1,4}: a≡1 and b≡4, or a≡4 and b≡1.

number of ways: 10*10=100.

same for {2,4} and {3,4}.

therefore, total number of favorable pairs is 4 * 100 = 400.

wait, but earlier i calculated 445 favorable pairs.

there's a discrepancy here.

wait, in my first approach, i calculated 1225 - 780 = 445.

in this second approach, i got 4*100=400.

there's a difference of 45.

i must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.

let me check.

in the first approach, i said that the number of pairs where at least one is ≡4 mod5 is 1225 - c(40,2)=1225-780=445.

in the second approach, considering residues, i have 4 types of unordered pairs: {0,4}, {1,4}, {2,4}, {3,4}, each contributing 10*10=100 pairs, total 400.

so, which one is correct?

let me think again.

in the residue approach, i considered only the pairs where one is ≡4 and the other is ≡0,1,2,3.

but there are also pairs where both are ≡4.

wait a minute, in the first approach, "at least one is ≡4", which includes pairs where both are ≡4.

in the residue approach, i only considered pairs where one is ≡4 and the other is ≡0,1,2,3.

i didn't consider pairs where both are ≡4.

so, in addition to the 400 pairs where one is ≡4 and the other is not, there are pairs where both are ≡4.

number of such pairs: c(10,2)=45.

therefore, total favorable pairs should be 400 + 45 = 445, which matches the first approach.

yes, that's the mistake i made in the residue approach. i forgot to include the pairs where both a and b are ≡4 mod5.

so, total favorable pairs: 400 (from {0,4}, {1,4}, {2,4}, {3,4}) + 45 (from {4,4}) = 445.

therefore, both approaches confirm that the number of favorable pairs is 445.

thus, the probability is 445 / 1225.

which simplifies to 89/245, as previously calculated.

therefore, the probability is 89/245.

alternatively, i can check if this fraction can be simplified further.

as i thought earlier, 89 is a prime number, and 89 does not divide 245 (since 245 ÷ 89 is not an integer), so 89 and 245 are coprime, and 89/245 is the simplest form.

alternatively, if i want to express it as a decimal, 89 ÷ 245 ≈ 0.36329..., so approximately 36.33%.

but probably, the answer is expected in fractional form.

therefore, the probability is \boxed{\dfrac{89}{245}}.

**final answer**
