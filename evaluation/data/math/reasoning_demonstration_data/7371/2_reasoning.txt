Reasoning: Alright, so I've got this problem here: I need to find a two-digit number that's even, a multiple of 11, and the product of its digits is a perfect cube. Okay, let's break this down.

First, it's a two-digit number, so it's between 10 and 99. It's even, so the last digit has to be even: 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Also, it's a multiple of 11. Hmm, multiples of 11 in the two-digit range are 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99. But since it's even, that narrows it down to 22, 44, 66, and 88.

Now, I need the product of its digits to be a perfect cube. Let's see what that means. A perfect cube is a number that's the cube of an integer, like 1 (1^3), 8 (2^3), 27 (3^3), 64 (4^3), and so on.

So, let's look at each of these candidates:

1. 22: The digits are 2 and 2, so the product is 2*2=4. Is 4 a perfect cube? Well, 4 is 2^2, which is a square, not a cube. So, no.

2. 44: Digits are 4 and 4, product is 4*4=16. 16 is 2^4, which is not a perfect cube.

3. 66: Digits are 6 and 6, product is 6*6=36. 36 is 6^2, again a square, not a cube.

4. 88: Digits are 8 and 8, product is 8*8=64. Oh, 64 is 4^3, which is a perfect cube.

So, it looks like 88 fits all the criteria: it's a two-digit even number, a multiple of 11, and the product of its digits is a perfect cube.

But wait, maybe I should double-check if there are any other multiples of 11 that I missed that are even. Let's list all two-digit multiples of 11: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99. Of these, the even ones are 22, 44, 66, and 88, as I thought earlier. And among these, only 88 has a digit product that's a perfect cube.

I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other interpretations of the problem. Like, does "two-digit number" include numbers with a leading zero? No, because that would make it a single-digit number in disguise.

Also, "product of its digits is a perfect cube" â€“ I took that to mean the product is equal to some integer cubed. I don't think there's another way to interpret that.

Yeah, I'm pretty confident that 88 is the correct answer.
