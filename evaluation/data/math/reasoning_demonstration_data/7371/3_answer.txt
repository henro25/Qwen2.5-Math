Answer: The two-digit number that satisfies the given conditions is **88**.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Range and Properties:**
   - The number is a two-digit even number and a multiple of 11.
   - Two-digit multiples of 11 are: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99.
   - Since it's even, the possible candidates are: 22, 44, 66, and 88.

2. **Check the Product of Digits for Each Candidate:**
   - **22:** Digits are 2 and 2. Product: 2 * 2 = 4. 4 is not a perfect cube.
   - **44:** Digits are 4 and 4. Product: 4 * 4 = 16. 16 is not a perfect cube.
   - **66:** Digits are 6 and 6. Product: 6 * 6 = 36. 36 is not a perfect cube.
   - **88:** Digits are 8 and 8. Product: 8 * 8 = 64. 64 is 4Â³, which is a perfect cube.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The number 88 meets all the specified conditions: it is a two-digit even number, a multiple of 11, and the product of its digits is a perfect cube.

Thus, the number is **88**.
