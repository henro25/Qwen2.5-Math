Answer: To solve the problem, we need to find a number \( n \) such that:

1. \( 100 < n < 200 \)
2. \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \)
3. \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \)
4. \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \)

first, we list numbers that satisfy \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \) within the range 100 to 200:

\[ 101, 105, 109, 113, 117, 121, 125, 129, 133, 137, 141, 145, 149, 153, 157, 161, 165, 169, 173, 177, 181, 185, 189, 193, 197 \]

next, we check which of these numbers also satisfy \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \):

\[ 117, 137, 157, 177, 197 \]

finally, we check which of these numbers also satisfy \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \):

\[ 157 \]

thus, the number of members in the marching band is:

\[
\boxed{157}
\]
