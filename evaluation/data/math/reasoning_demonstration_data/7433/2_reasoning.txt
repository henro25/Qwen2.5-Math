Reasoning: Let's tackle this problem step by step. so, we've got a marching band with more than 100 but fewer than 200 members. and there are some conditions about how they line up in rows of 4, 5, and 7 with some extra people each time.

first, let's translate the problem into mathematical terms. we need to find a number 
n
n such that:

1. 
100
<
n
<
200
100<n<200

2. when 
n
n is divided by 4, there's a remainder of 1. so, 
n
≡
1
(
m
o
d
4
)
n≡1(mod4)

3. when 
n
n is divided by 5, there's a remainder of 2. so, 
n
≡
2
(
m
o
d
5
)
n≡2(mod5)

4. when 
n
n is divided by 7, there's a remainder of 3. so, 
n
≡
3
(
m
o
d
7
)
n≡3(mod7)

alright, so we have a system of congruences here. this seems like a job for the chinese remainder theorem, but since we're dealing with small numbers, maybe we can find a solution by inspection or by finding a common pattern.

let's start by listing numbers that satisfy the first condition: 
n
≡
1
(
m
o
d
4
)
n≡1(mod4). that means 
n
n can be written as 
n
=
4
k
+
1
n=4k+1 for some integer 
k

now, from this list, we need to find numbers that also satisfy 
n
≡
2
(
m
o
d
5
)
n≡2(mod5), meaning when divided by 5, the remainder is 2.

let's check each number:

- 101 divided by 5 is 20 with a remainder of 1. not 2.

- 105 divided by 5 is 21 with a remainder of 0. not 2.

- 109 divided by 5 is 21 with a remainder of 4. not 2.

- 113 divided by 5 is 22 with a remainder of 3. not 2.

- 117 divided by 5 is 23 with a remainder of 2. bingo!

- 121 divided by 5 is 24 with a remainder of 1. not 2.

- 125 divided by 5 is 25 with a remainder of 0. not 2.

- 129 divided by 5 is 25 with a remainder of 4. not 2.

- 133 divided by 5 is 26 with a remainder of 3. not 2.

- 137 divided by 5 is 27 with a remainder of 2. another one!

- 141 divided by 5 is 28 with a remainder of 1. not 2.

- 145 divided by 5 is 29 with a remainder of 0. not 2.

- 149 divided by 5 is 29 with a remainder of 4. not 2.

- 153 divided by 5 is 30 with a remainder of 3. not 2.

- 157 divided by 5 is 31 with a remainder of 2. another hit!

- 161 divided by 5 is 32 with a remainder of 1. not 2.

- 165 divided by 5 is 33 with a remainder of 0. not 2.

- 169 divided by 5 is 33 with a remainder of 4. not 2.

- 173 divided by 5 is 34 with a remainder of 3. not 2.

- 177 divided by 5 is 35 with a remainder of 2. another one!

- 181 divided by 5 is 36 with a remainder of 1. not 2.

- 185 divided by 5 is 37 with a remainder of 0. not 2.

- 189 divided by 5 is 37 with a remainder of 4. not 2.

- 193 divided by 5 is 38 with a remainder of 3. not 2.

- 197 divided by 5 is 39 with a remainder of 2. last one!

so, the numbers that satisfy both 
n
≡
1
(
m
o
d
4
)
n≡1(mod4) and 
n
≡
2
(
m
o
d
5
)
n≡2(mod5) are: 117, 137, 157, 177, 197.

now, we need to find which of these also satisfies 
n
≡
3
(
m
o
d
7
)
n≡3(mod7), meaning when divided by 7, the remainder is 3.

let's check each of these:

- 117 divided by 7: 16*7=112, 117-112=5. remainder 5. not 3.

- 137 divided by 7: 19*7=133, 137-133=4. remainder 4. not 3.

- 157 divided by 7: 22*7=154, 157-154=3. remainder 3. perfect!

- 177 divided by 7: 25*7=175, 177-175=2. remainder 2. not 3.

- 197 divided by 7: 28*7=196, 197-196=1. remainder 1. not 3.

so, only 157 satisfies all three conditions.

wait, just to be sure, let's verify all the conditions for 157:

1. 
100
<
157
<
200
100<157<200: yes.

2. 
157
÷
4
=
39
157÷4=39 with a remainder of 1: yes, because 4*39=156, and 157-156=1.

3. 
157
÷
5
=
31
157÷5=31 with a remainder of 2: yes, because 5*31=155, and 157-155=2.

4. 
157
÷
7
=
22
157÷7=22 with a remainder of 3: yes, because 7*22=154, and 157-154=3.

everything checks out. so, the marching band has 157 members.

**final answer**

157
