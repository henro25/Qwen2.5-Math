Reasoning: So i have this inequality to solve: 
(
n
−
2
)
(
n
+
4
)
(
n
+
8
)
<
0
(n−2)(n+4)(n+8)<0, and i need to find all integer values of 
n
n between 
−
11
−11 and 
11
11 that satisfy it. okay, first things first, i need to understand when the product of these three factors is negative.

i remember that when multiplying numbers, if there's an odd number of negative factors, the product is negative. if there's an even number of negative factors, the product is positive. so, for the product 
(
n
−
2
)
(
n
+
4
)
(
n
+
8
)
(n−2)(n+4)(n+8) to be negative, there must be an odd number of negative factors among 
n
−
2
n−2, 
n
+
4
n+4, and 
n
+
8
n+8.

let me think about the zeros of each factor because those points will divide the number line into intervals where the sign of the product might change. the zeros are at 
n
=
2
n=2, 
n
=
−
4
n=−4, and 
n
=
−
8
n=−8. so, these points divide the number line into four intervals:

1. 
n
<
−
8
n<−8

2. 
−
8
<
n
<
−
4
−8<n<−4

3. 
−
4
<
n
<
2
−4<n<2

4. 
n
>
2
n>2

i need to test each interval to see where the product is negative.

starting with 
n
<
−
8
n<−8: let's pick a test value, say 
n
=
−
10
n=−10.

(
−
10
−
2
)
=
−
12
,
(
−
10
+
4
)
=
−
6
,
(
−
10
+
8
)
=
−
2
(−10−2)=−12,(−10+4)=−6,(−10+8)=−2
so, the product is 
(
−
12
)
(
−
6
)
(
−
2
)
=
−
144
(−12)(−6)(−2)=−144, which is negative. so, all 
n
<
−
8
n<−8 satisfy the inequality.

next, 
−
8
<
n
<
−
4
−8<n<−4: let's pick 
n
=
−
6
n=−6.

(
−
6
−
2
)
=
−
8
,
(
−
6
+
4
)
=
−
2
,
(
−
6
+
8
)
=
2
(−6−2)=−8,(−6+4)=−2,(−6+8)=2
product: 
(
−
8
)
(
−
2
)
(
2
)
=
32
(−8)(−2)(2)=32, which is positive. doesn't satisfy the inequality.

then, 
−
4
<
n
<
2
−4<n<2: choose 
n
=
0
n=0.

(
0
−
2
)
=
−
2
,
(
0
+
4
)
=
4
,
(
0
+
8
)
=
8
(0−2)=−2,(0+4)=4,(0+8)=8
product: 
(
−
2
)
(
4
)
(
8
)
=
−
64
(−2)(4)(8)=−64, which is negative. so, this interval satisfies the inequality.

lastly, 
n
>
2
n>2: pick 
n
=
3
n=3.

(
3
−
2
)
=
1
,
(
3
+
4
)
=
7
,
(
3
+
8
)
=
11
(3−2)=1,(3+4)=7,(3+8)=11
product: 
1
×
7
×
11
=
77
1×7×11=77, which is positive. doesn't satisfy the inequality.

so, the solution intervals are 
n
<
−
8
n<−8 and 
−
4
<
n
<
2
−4<n<2.

now, i need to find all integer values of 
n
n between 
−
11
−11 and 
11
11 that fall into these intervals.

first, 
n
<
−
8
n<−8: integers from 
−
11
−11 to 
−
9
−9. let's list them:

−
11
,
−
10
,
−
9
−11,−10,−9

second, 
−
4
<
n
<
2
−4<n<2: integers from 
−
3
−3 to 
1
1. so:

−
3
,
−
2
,
−
1
,
0
,
1
−3,−2,−1,0,1

now, let's count them:

from 
−
11
−11 to 
−
9
−9: 3 numbers

from 
−
3
−3 to 
1
1: 5 numbers

total: 
3
+
5
=
8
3+5=8 integers.

wait a minute, i should double-check if these endpoints are included or not.

for 
n
<
−
8
n<−8, does 
n
=
−
8
n=−8 satisfy the inequality?

let's plug 
n
=
−
8
n=−8 into the expression:

(
−
8
−
2
)
=
−
10
,
(
−
8
+
4
)
=
−
4
,
(
−
8
+
8
)
=
0
(−8−2)=−10,(−8+4)=−4,(−8+8)=0
product: 
(
−
10
)
(
−
4
)
(
0
)
=
0
(−10)(−4)(0)=0, which is not less than 0. so, 
n
=
−
8
n=−8 is not included.

similarly, for 
−
4
<
n
<
2
−4<n<2, check 
n
=
−
4
n=−4 and 
n
=
2
n=2:

for 
n
=
−
4
n=−4:

(
−
4
−
2
)
=
−
6
,
(
−
4
+
4
)
=
0
,
(
−
4
+
8
)
=
4
(−4−2)=−6,(−4+4)=0,(−4+8)=4
product: 
(
−
6
)
(
0
)
(
4
)
=
0
(−6)(0)(4)=0, not less than 0.

for 
n
=
2
n=2:

(
2
−
2
)
=
0
,
(
2
+
4
)
=
6
,
(
2
+
8
)
=
10
(2−2)=0,(2+4)=6,(2+8)=10
product: 
0
×
6
×
10
=
0
0×6×10=0, again not less than 0.

so, endpoints are correctly excluded.

therefore, the integers that satisfy the inequality are:

−
11
,
−
10
,
−
9
,
−
3
,
−
2
,
−
1
,
0
,
1
−11,−10,−9,−3,−2,−1,0,1

that's 8 integers in total.

**final answer**

8
