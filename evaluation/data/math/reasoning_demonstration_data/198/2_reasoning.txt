Reasoning: So i've got this problem to find the maximum value of the expression 
x
4
x
8
+
2
x
6
−
4
x
4
+
8
x

+
16
x 
8
 +2x 
6
 −4x 
4
 +8x 
2
 +16
x 
4
 
​
  for real numbers 
x
x. hmm, looks a bit tricky with all those exponents. i need to find a way to simplify this or maybe find a substitution that makes it easier to handle.

first, i notice that the denominator is a polynomial of degree 8, and the numerator is degree 4. that suggests that as 
x
x gets very large or very small, the denominator will dominate, and the whole expression will approach zero. so, the maximum must occur somewhere in between.

maybe i can set 
y
=
x
2
y=x 
2
 , since all the exponents in the expression are even powers of 
x
x. let's try that substitution:

let 
y
=
x
2
y=x 
2
 , then 
x
4
=
y
2
x 
4
 =y 
2
 , 
x
6
=
y
3
x 
6
 =y 
3
 , and 
x
8
=
y
4
x 
8
 =y 
4
 . substituting these into the expression, i get:

y
2
y
4
+
2
y
3
−
4
y
2
+
8
y
+
16
y 
4
 +2y 
3
 −4y 
2
 +8y+16
y 
2
 
​
 
okay, now i have a function in terms of 
y
y, where 
y
≥
0
y≥0 since it's 
x
2
x 
2
 .

i need to find the maximum of 
y
2
y
4
+
2
y
3
−
4
y
2
+
8
y
+
16
y 
4
 +2y 
3
 −4y 
2
 +8y+16
y 
2
 
​
  for 
y
≥
0
y≥0.

maybe i can think about this as optimizing the ratio of two polynomials. one approach could be to take the derivative and set it to zero to find critical points, but that might be messy with these high-degree polynomials.

alternatively, perhaps i can look for a way to complete the square or factor the denominator in a way that makes the expression simpler.

let me look at the denominator: 
y
4
+
2
y
3
−
4
y
2
+
8
y
+
16
y 
4
 +2y 
3
 −4y 
2
 +8y+16. is there a way to factor this?

hmm, factoring quartic polynomials can be tough. maybe i can try to factor it into quadratics. suppose it factors as 
(
y
2
+
a
y
+
b
)
(
y
2
+
c
y
+
d
)
(y 
2
 +ay+b)(y 
2
 +cy+d). then, expanding, i get:

y
4
+
(
a
+
c
)
y
3
+
(
a
c
+
b
+
d
)
y
2
+
(
a
d
+
b
c
)
y
+
b
d
y 
4
 +(a+c)y 
3
 +(ac+b+d)y 
2
 +(ad+bc)y+bd
comparing coefficients:

{
a
+
c
=
2
a
c
+
b
+
d
=
−
4
a
d
+
b
c
=
8
b
d
=
16
⎩
⎨
⎧
​
  
a+c=2
ac+b+d=−4
ad+bc=8
bd=16
​
 
this seems complicated. maybe there's a better approach.

wait a minute, perhaps i can consider the denominator as a quadratic in terms of 
y
2
y 
2
 . let me see:

y
4
+
2
y
3
−
4
y
2
+
8
y
+
16
=
y
4
+

y
3
−
4
y
2

8
y

16
y

 +2y 
3
 −4y 
2
 +8y+16=y 
4
 +2y 
3
 −4y 
2
 +8y+16

not sure if that helps directly.

another idea: since the denominator is a quartic, and the numerator is a quadratic, maybe i can perform polynomial division or see if the denominator can be expressed in terms of the numerator.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the expression as 
1
y
4
+
2
y

−

y

y

​
 = 
y 
2
 +2y−4+ 
y
8
​
 + 
y 
2
 
16
​
 
1
​
 , but that seems more complicated.

wait, maybe i can write the denominator in terms of 
y
2
+
16
y
2
y 
2
 + 
y 
2
 
16
​
 , since that appears in the denominator.

let me try to rearrange the denominator:

y
4
+
2
y
3
−
4
y
2
+
8
y
+
16
=
y

3
 −4y 
2
 +8y+16=y

 −4y

hmm, not obvious. maybe i can group terms:

y

y

−

y
2
+
8
y

 −5y 
2
 +8y+16

still not helpful. perhaps i should try a different approach.

let's consider the derivative of the original expression with respect to 
y
y, set it to zero, and solve for 
y
y.

let 
f
(
y
)
=
y
2
y
4
+
2
y
3
−
4
y
2
+
8
y
+
16
f(y)= 
y 
4
 +2y 
3
 −4y 
2
 +8y+16
y 
2
 
​
 

then, 
f

(

=

y
(
y

)
(
y

y

)
2
f

 (y)= 
(y

2
 
2y(y

3
 −4y 
2
 +8y+16)−y 
2
 (4y 
3
 +6y 
2
 −8y+8)
​
 

set numerator equal to zero:

2
y
(
y
4
+
2
y
3
−
4
y
2
+
8
y
+
16
)
−
y
2
(
4

y

−
8
y
+

)
=
0
2y(y

 +2y 
3
 −4y 
2
 +8y+16)−y 
2
 (4y 
3
 +6y 
2
 −8y+8)=0

factor out 
y
y:

y
[
2
(
y
4
+
2
y
3
−
4
y
2
+
8
y

)
−
y
(

]
=

y[2(y 
4
 +2y 
3
 −4y 
2
 +8y+16)−y(4y 
3
 +6y 
2
 −8y+8)]=0

so, either 
y
=
0
y=0 or the expression in the brackets is zero.

if 
y
=
0
y=0, the original expression is zero, which is not likely the maximum.

so, set the bracketed expression to zero:

2
(
y
4
+
2
y
3
−
4
y
2

y

3
 −4y 
2
 +8y+16)−y(4y

expand:

combine like terms:

(

y

−
2
y
3
+

y
2
+
8
y
+
32
)
=

(−2y 
4
 −2y

 +0y 
2
 +8y+32)=0

simplify:

−

y

−

y
3
+
8
y
+
32
=
0
−2y 
4
 −2y 
3
 +8y+32=0

multiply both sides by -1:

2
y
4
+
2
y
3
−
8
y
−
32
=
0
2y 
4
 +2y 
3
 −8y−32=0

divide both sides by 2:

y
4
+
y
3
−
4
y
−
16
=
0
y 
4
 +y 
3
 −4y−16=0

now, i need to solve 
y
4
+
y
3
−
4
y
−
16
=
0
y 
4
 +y 
3
 −4y−16=0

this is a quartic equation, which might be difficult to solve directly. maybe i can look for rational roots using the rational root theorem. possible rational roots are factors of 16 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±4, ±8, ±16.

let's test 
y
=
2
y=2:

2
4
+
2
3
−
4
∗
2
−
16
=
16
+
8
−
8
−
16
=
0
2 
4
 +2 
3
 −4∗2−16=16+8−8−16=0. yes, 
y
=
2
y=2 is a root.

so, i can factor out 
(
y
−
2
)
(y−2) from the quartic.

let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor 
y
4
+
y
3
−
4
y
−
16
y 
4
 +y 
3
 −4y−16 by 
(
y
−
2
)
(y−2).

using synthetic division:

2 | 1   1   0   -4   -16

2   6   12   16

1   3   6   8   0

so, the quartic factors as 
(
y
−
2
)
(
y
3
+
3
y
2
+
6
y
+
8
)
(y−2)(y 
3
 +3y 
2
 +6y+8)

now, set 
y
3
+
3
y
2
+
6
y
+
8
=
0
y 
3
 +3y 
2
 +6y+8=0

again, try rational roots: possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±4, ±8.

test 
y
=
−
2
y=−2:

(
−
2
)
3
+
3
(
−
2
)
2
+
6
(
−
2
)
+
8
=
−
8
+
12
−
12
+
8
=
0
(−2) 
3
 +3(−2) 
2
 +6(−2)+8=−8+12−12+8=0. so, 
y
=
−
2
y=−2 is a root.

factor out 
(
y
+
2
)
(y+2):

using synthetic division:

-2 | 1   3   6   8

-2   -2   -8

1   1   4   0

so, the cubic factors as 
(
y
+
2
)
(
y
2
+
y
+
4
)
(y+2)(y 
2
 +y+4)

therefore, the quartic factors as 
(
y
−
2
)
(
y
+
2
)
(
y
2
+
y
+
4
)
(y−2)(y+2)(y 
2
 +y+4)

set to zero: 
y
=
2
y=2, 
y
=
−
2
y=−2, or 
y
2
+
y
+
4
=
0
y 
2
 +y+4=0

the quadratic 
y
2
+
y
+
4
=
0
y 
2
 +y+4=0 has discriminant 
1
−
16
=
−
15
<
0
1−16=−15<0, so no real roots.

since 
y
=
x
2
≥
0
y=x 
2
 ≥0, 
y
=
−
2
y=−2 is not valid.

so, the only critical point is at 
y
=
2
y=2.

now, i need to check if this is a maximum.

compute the second derivative or simply check the behavior around 
y
=
2
y=2.

alternatively, since the denominator is always positive for real 
y
y (as 
y
4
+
2
y
3
−
4
y
2
+
8
y
+
16
y 
4
 +2y 
3
 −4y 
2
 +8y+16 is positive for all real 
y
y), and the function approaches zero as 
y
y approaches 0 or infinity, 
y
=
2
y=2 should give the maximum value.

now, compute the value at 
y
=
2
y=2:

f
(
2
)
=
2
2
2
4
+
2
∗
2
3
−
4
∗
2
2
+
8
∗
2
+
16
=
4
16
+
16
−
16
+
16
+
16
=
4
48
=
1
12
f(2)= 
2 
4
 +2∗2 
3
 −4∗2 
2
 +8∗2+16
2 
2
 
​
 = 
16+16−16+16+16
4
​
 = 
48
4
​
 = 
12
1
​
 
so, the maximum value is 
1
12
12
1
​
 .

wait, but maybe i should check if there are other critical points or confirm that this is indeed the maximum.

given that the denominator is always positive and the function approaches zero at the extremes, and there's only one critical point at 
y
=
2
y=2, this should indeed be the maximum.

alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to see that the maximum is 
1
12
12
1
​
 .

let me consider that maybe the denominator can be expressed in terms of the numerator plus some constant.

alternatively, maybe i can use the am-gm inequality or some other inequality to find the maximum.

let's try that approach.

we have:

f
(
y
)
=
y
2
y
4
+
2
y
3
−
4
y
2
+
8
y
+
16
f(y)= 
y 
4
 +2y 
3
 −4y 
2
 +8y+16
y 
2
 
​
 
i need to maximize this for 
y
≥
0
y≥0.

maybe i can write the denominator as 
y
4
+
2
y
3
−
4
y
2
+
8
y
+
16
=
y
4
+
2
y
3
+
y

+
(
−
5
y

)
+
8
y
+
16
y 
4
 +2y 
3
 −4y 
2
 +8y+16=y 
4
 +2y 
3
 +y 
2
 +(−5y 
2
 )+8y+16, but that doesn't seem helpful.

alternatively, perhaps i can complete the square or find some expression that allows me to bound the denominator below.

wait, maybe i can consider the denominator as a sum of squares or something similar.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider substituting 
z
=
y
+
a
z=y+a, where 
a
a is chosen to simplify the denominator.

this might be too vague.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that the denominator is always greater than or equal to some multiple of the numerator, and find the smallest such multiple, which would give the maximum of the ratio.

wait, that sounds similar to optimization techniques.

alternatively, maybe i can think of the denominator as 
y
4
+
2
y
3
−
4
y
2
+
8
y
+
16
=
(
y

y

y

)
+
(
−

)
y

 −4y 
2
 +8y+16=(y 
4
 +2y 
3
 +y 
2
 )+(−5y 
2
 +8y+16), but still not helpful.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that for 
y
>
0
y>0, the denominator grows faster than the numerator as 
y
y increases, which supports the earlier conclusion that the maximum occurs at 
y
=
2
y=2.

given that, and that i already found that 
f
(
2
)
=
1
12
f(2)= 
12
1
​
 , perhaps i can conclude that the maximum value is 
1
12
12
1
​
 .

alternatively, maybe there's a way to see this without calculus.

let me try to express the denominator in terms of 
y
2
y 
2
 :

y
4
+
2
y
3
−
4
y
2
+
8
y

=

 −4y 
2
 +8y+16=y 
4
 +2y 
3
 +y 
2
 −5y 
2
 +8y+16

not helpful.

alternatively, perhaps i can write the denominator as 
y
4
+
2
y
3
+
y
2
+
(
−
5
y
2
+
8
y
+
16
)
y 
4
 +2y 
3
 +y 
2
 +(−5y 
2
 +8y+16), but again, not much better.

wait, perhaps i can write it as 
y
4
+
2
y
3
+
y
2
+
(
−
5
y
2
+
8
y
+
16
)
y 
4
 +2y 
3
 +y 
2
 +(−5y 
2
 +8y+16), but it's still not helpful.

alternatively, maybe i can consider that the denominator can be expressed as a product involving 
y
2
+
a
y
+
b
y 
2
 +ay+b, but that's similar to factoring, which i already tried.

given that the calculus approach led me to 
y
=
2
y=2 and 
f
(
2
)
=
1
12
f(2)= 
12
1
​
 , and that seems reasonable, perhaps that's the answer.

alternatively, maybe i can consider specific values of 
x
x to see if i can get a higher value.

for example, at 
x
=
0
x=0, the expression is 0.

at 
x
=
1
x=1, it's 
1
1
+
2
−
4
+
8
+
16
=
1
23
1+2−4+8+16
1
​
 = 
23
1
​
 , which is less than 
1
12
12
1
​
 .

at 
x
=
2
x=

​
 , 
y
=

x=2, 
y
=

so, it seems that 
y
=

y=2 gives the highest value among these points.

therefore, the maximum value of the expression is
