Reasoning: So i have this geometry problem here. it says that points a, b, and c lie on the surface of a sphere with center o and radius 20. i'm given the lengths of the sides of triangle abc: ab=13, bc=14, and ca=15. i need to find the distance from o to the plane of triangle abc, and it's given in the form m√n / k, where m and k are relatively prime, and n is square-free. finally, i have to find m + n + k.

alright, first, since a, b, and c are on the sphere, they're all at a distance of 20 from o. the plane of triangle abc is at some distance from o, and i need to find that distance.

i recall that for a sphere, if you have a plane cutting through it, the distance from the center to the plane is related to the radius and the radius of the circle formed by the intersection.

wait, more formally, if you have a sphere of radius r, and a plane at a distance d from the center, then the radius of the circle formed by the intersection is sqrt(r^2 - d^2).

in this case, the plane of triangle abc cuts the sphere in a circle, and triangle abc lies on that circle. but actually, triangle abc might not be the entire circle; it's just a triangle inscribed in the circle.

wait, actually, since a, b, and c are points on the sphere, and the plane containing them cuts the sphere in a circle, which is the circumcircle of triangle abc.

so, the circumradius of triangle abc is the radius of that circle, and then i can relate that to the distance from o to the plane.

let me denote the circumradius of triangle abc as r. then, according to the formula, r = sqrt(r^2 - d^2), where d is the distance from o to the plane.

wait, actually, i think it's the other way around. the formula is r = sqrt(r^2 - d^2), where r is the sphere's radius, d is the distance from the center to the plane, and r is the circumradius of the triangle on the plane.

wait, no. actually, in the formula for a circle on a sphere, the radius of the circle (let's call it r) is related to the distance from the center to the plane (d) by r = sqrt(r^2 - d^2).

but in this case, r is the circumradius of the triangle abc, which lies on the circle of radius r.

wait, i'm getting confused.

let me recall that for a triangle inscribed in a circle of radius r, the circumradius r of the triangle is related to the sides by the formula:

r = (a b c) / (4 δ),

where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle, and δ is the area of the triangle.

so, if i can find the area of triangle abc, i can find r, and then relate it to r and d via r = sqrt(r^2 - d^2).

wait, no. actually, the radius r of the circumcircle is related to r and d by r = sqrt(r^2 - d^2).

wait, is that correct?

let me think again.

if i have a sphere of radius r, and a plane at distance d from the center, then the intersection is a circle of radius r = sqrt(r^2 - d^2).

now, the circumradius of the triangle inscribed in that circle is r = r.

but is that correct?

wait, no. the circumradius of the triangle is r = (a b c) / (4 δ), and the circle in which the triangle is inscribed has radius r = sqrt(r^2 - d^2).

so, r = r = sqrt(r^2 - d^2).

wait, no. the circumradius of the triangle is equal to r, the radius of the circle in which it is inscribed.

so, r = r = sqrt(r^2 - d^2).

therefore, d = sqrt(r^2 - r^2).

yes, that seems right.

so, my goal is to find d = sqrt(r^2 - r^2), where r = 20, and r is the circumradius of triangle abc.

therefore, i need to find r first.

to find r, i can use the formula r = (a b c) / (4 δ), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle, and δ is its area.

given a=13, b=14, c=15.

first, find the area δ of triangle abc.

i can use heron's formula.

first, compute the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (13 + 14 + 15)/2 = 42/2 = 21.

then, δ = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[21(21 - 13)(21 - 14)(21 - 15)] = sqrt[21 * 8 * 7 * 6].

compute inside the square root: 21 * 8 = 168, 168 * 7 = 1176, 1176 * 6 = 7056.

so, δ = sqrt(7056).

what's sqrt(7056)? let's see: 84^2 = 7056. so, δ = 84.

now, r = (a b c) / (4 δ) = (13 * 14 * 15) / (4 * 84).

compute numerator: 13 * 14 = 182, 182 * 15 = 2730.

denominator: 4 * 84 = 336.

so, r = 2730 / 336.

simplify this fraction.

first, divide numerator and denominator by 42: 2730 ÷ 42 = 65, 336 ÷ 42 = 8.

so, r = 65 / 8.

now, d = sqrt(r^2 - r^2) = sqrt(20^2 - (65/8)^2) = sqrt(400 - (4225 / 64)).

to subtract these, convert 400 to a fraction with denominator 64: 400 = 400 * 64 / 64 = 25600 / 64.

so, d = sqrt(25600/64 - 4225/64) = sqrt((25600 - 4225)/64) = sqrt(21375 / 64).

simplify sqrt(21375 / 64) = sqrt(21375)/8.

now, simplify sqrt(21375).

factor 21375:

21375 ÷ 25 = 855.

855 ÷ 5 = 171.

171 ÷ 9 = 19.

so, 21375 = 25 * 855 = 25 * 5 * 171 = 25 * 5 * 9 * 19 = 5^3 * 3^2 * 19.

therefore, sqrt(21375) = sqrt(5^3 * 3^2 * 19) = 5 * 3 * sqrt(5 * 19) = 15 sqrt(95).

so, d = 15 sqrt(95) / 8.

now, the problem says the distance is m sqrt(n) / k, where m and k are relatively prime, and n is square-free.

here, m = 15, n = 95, k = 8.

are m and k relatively prime? 15 and 8 share no common factors besides 1, so yes.

is n square-free? 95 factors into 5 * 19, both primes, so yes.

therefore, m + n + k = 15 + 95 + 8 = 118.

**final answer**

118
