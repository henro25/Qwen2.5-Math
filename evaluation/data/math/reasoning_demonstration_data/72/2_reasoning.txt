Reasoning: So i have this problem here: if 
m
+
1
m
=
8
m+ 
m
1
​
 =8, then what is the value of 
m
2
+
1
m
2
+
4
m 
2
 + 
m 
2
 
1
​
 +4? hmm, interesting. i need to find the value of this expression, and i have this equation involving 
m
m and its reciprocal. i'm not entirely sure how to approach this, but i think i can use some algebraic identities to simplify things.

first, i recall that there's a relationship between 
m
+
1
m
m+ 
m
1
​
  and 
m
2
+
1
m
2
m 
2
 + 
m 
2
 
1
​
 . specifically, there's a formula that connects these two expressions. if i square both sides of the equation 
m
+
1
m
=
8
m+ 
m
1
​
 =8, i can probably find an expression for 
m
2
+
1
m
2
m 
2
 + 
m 
2
 
1
​
 .

so, let's try that. squaring both sides:

(
m
+
1
m
)
2
=
8
2
(m+ 
m
1
​
 ) 
2
 =8 
2
 
expanding the left side:

m
2
+
2
⋅
m
⋅
1
m
+
1
m
2
=
64
m 
2
 +2⋅m⋅ 
m
1
​
 + 
m 
2
 
1
​
 =64
simplifying the middle term:

m
2
+
2
+
1
m
2
=
64
m 
2
 +2+ 
m 
2
 
1
​
 =64
now, i can solve for 
m
2
+
1
m
2
m 
2
 + 
m 
2
 
1
​
 :

m
2
+
1
m
2
=
64
−
2
=
62
m 
2
 + 
m 
2
 
1
​
 =64−2=62
okay, so 
m
2
+
1
m
2
=
62
m 
2
 + 
m 
2
 
1
​
 =62. but the problem asks for 
m
2
+
1
m
2
+
4
m 
2
 + 
m 
2
 
1
​
 +4. so, i just need to add 4 to 62:

62
+
4
=
66
62+4=66
wait a minute, that seems straightforward. is there a way to verify this? maybe i should check if my steps make sense.

first, i squared both sides of the equation 
m
+
1
m
=
8
m+ 
m
1
​
 =8, which should be valid as long as 
m
m is not zero, and since 
m
m appears in the denominator, 
m
m can't be zero anyway.

then, i expanded the left side correctly: 
m
2
+
2
⋅
m
⋅
1
m
+
1
m
2
m 
2
 +2⋅m⋅ 
m
1
​
 + 
m 
2
 
1
​
 , which simplifies to 
m
2
+
2
+
1
m
2
m 
2
 +2+ 
m 
2
 
1
​
 .

subtracting 2 from both sides gives 
m
2
+
1
m
2
=
62
m 
2
 + 
m 
2
 
1
​
 =62, which seems correct.

adding 4 to 62 gives 66, so the final answer should be 66.

just to be thorough, maybe i can try plugging in a value for 
m
m that satisfies the original equation and see if it works.

let's solve for 
m
m from the original equation:

m
+
1
m
=
8
m+ 
m
1
​
 =8

multiply both sides by 
m
m:

m
2
+
1
=
8
m
m 
2
 +1=8m

rearrange:

m
2
−
8
m
+
1
=
0
m 
2
 −8m+1=0

this is a quadratic equation. using the quadratic formula:

m
=
8
±
64
−
4
2
=
8
±
60
2
=
8
±
2
15
2
=
4
±
15
m= 
2
8± 
64−4
​
 
​
 = 
2
8± 
60
​
 
​
 = 
2
8±2 
15
​
 
​
 =4± 
15
​
 

so, 
m
=
4
+
15
m=4+ 
15
​
  or 
m
=
4
−
15
m=4− 
15
​
 .

now, let's compute 
m
2
+
1
m
2
+
4
m 
2
 + 
m 
2
 
1
​
 +4 for one of these values. i'll take 
m
=
4
+
15
m=4+ 
15
​
 .

first, calculate 
m
2
m 
2
 :

m
2
=
(
4
+
15
)
2
=
16
+
8
15
+
15
=
31
+
8
15
m 
2
 =(4+ 
15
​
 ) 
2
 =16+8 
15
​
 +15=31+8 
15
​
 

next, calculate 
1
m
2
m 
2
 
1
​
 . since 
m
=
4
+
15
m=4+ 
15
​
 , 
1
m
=
4
−
15
m
1
​
 =4− 
15
​
 , because 
(
4
+
15
)
(
4
−
15
)
=
16
−
15
=
1
(4+ 
15
​
 )(4− 
15
​
 )=16−15=1. therefore, 
1
m
2
=
(
4
−
15
)
2
=
16
−
8
15
+
15
=
31
−
8
15
m 
2
 
1
​
 =(4− 
15
​
 ) 
2
 =16−8 
15
​
 +15=31−8 
15
​
 

now, add them together:

m
2
+
1
m
2
=
(
31
+
8
15
)
+
(
31
−
8
15
)
=
62
m 
2
 + 
m 
2
 
1
​
 =(31+8 
15
​
 )+(31−8 
15
​
 )=62

add 4:

62
+
4
=
66
62+4=66

so, it checks out. the answer is indeed 66.

alternatively, if i consider the other root 
m
=
4
−
15
m=4− 
15
​
 , i would get the same result because the terms involving 
15
15
​
  would cancel out in the same way.

therefore, the value of 
m
2
+
1
m
2
+
4
m 
2
 + 
m 
2
 
1
​
 +4 is 66.

**final answer**

66
66
