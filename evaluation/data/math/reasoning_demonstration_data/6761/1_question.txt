Problem: A number is divisible by $9$ if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9.$ For example, the number $19\,836$ is divisible by $9$ but $19\,825$ is not.

If $D\,767\,E89$ is divisible by $9,$ where $D$ and $E$ each represent a single digit, what is the sum of all possible values of the sum $D+E?$
