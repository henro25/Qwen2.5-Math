Reasoning: So i have this problem here: there's a unique two-digit positive integer 
t
t such that the last two digits of 
11
×
t
11×t are 36. i need to find what 
t
t is. hmm, okay, let's break this down.

first, since 
t
t is a two-digit number, it ranges from 10 to 99. and i need to find the one where 
11
×
t
11×t ends with 36. that means that when i multiply 11 by 
t
t, the product should be something like ...36, where the last two digits are 36.

i think i can express this using modular arithmetic. specifically, i want 
11
×
t
≡
36
(
m
o
d
100
)
11×t≡36(mod100), because i'm only concerned with the last two digits of the product.

so, 
11
t
≡
36
(
m
o
d
100
)
11t≡36(mod100).

now, i need to solve for 
t
t in this congruence. to do that, i can try to find the multiplicative inverse of 11 modulo 100, because if i can find a number 
x
x such that 
11
x
≡
1
(
m
o
d
100
)
11x≡1(mod100), then i can multiply both sides of the equation by 
x
x to get 
t
≡
36
x
(
m
o
d
100
)
t≡36x(mod100).

first, i need to check if 11 and 100 are coprime, because the inverse exists only if they are coprime. the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 11 and 100 should be 1, since 11 is a prime number and doesn't divide 100.

let me confirm that: 
gcd
⁡
(
11
,
100
)
gcd(11,100). 11 doesn't divide 100, and its only divisors are 1 and 11, so yes, 
gcd
⁡
(
11
,
100
)
=
1
gcd(11,100)=1. therefore, the inverse exists.

now, to find the inverse of 11 modulo 100, i can use the extended euclidean algorithm. let's recall how that works.

the extended euclidean algorithm finds integers 
x
x and 
y
y such that 
11
x
+
100
y
=
1
11x+100y=1. the coefficient 
x
x will be the inverse of 11 modulo 100.

let's apply the algorithm:

first, divide 100 by 11:

100
=
9
×
11
+
1
100=9×11+1

now, divide 11 by 1:

11
=
11
×
1
+
0
11=11×1+0

so, the gcd is 1, as expected.

now, back to the first equation:

1
=
100
−
9
×
11
1=100−9×11

this can be rewritten as:

1
=
−
9
×
11
+
1
×
100
1=−9×11+1×100

therefore, 
x
=
−
9
x=−9 is a solution to 
11
x
≡
1
(
m
o
d
100
)
11x≡1(mod100).

but i want a positive inverse, so i can add 100 to -9 to get 
x
=
91
x=91, since 
−
9
+
100
=
91
−9+100=91, and 
11
×
91
=
1001
11×91=1001, which is indeed congruent to 1 modulo 100.

so, the inverse of 11 modulo 100 is 91.

now, going back to the original equation:

11
t
≡
36
(
m
o
d
100
)
11t≡36(mod100)

multiply both sides by 91:

t
≡
36
×
91
(
m
o
d
100
)
t≡36×91(mod100)

let's calculate 
36
×
91
36×91:

first, 
30
×
90
=
2700
30×90=2700

then, 
30
×
1
=
30
30×1=30

next, 
6
×
90
=
540
6×90=540

and 
6
×
1
=
6
6×1=6

adding them up: 
2700
+
30
=
2730
2700+30=2730, plus 
540
=
3270
540=3270, plus 6 is 3276.

so, 
36
×
91
=
3276
36×91=3276

now, 
3276
(
m
o
d
100
)
3276(mod100) is 76, because 3276 divided by 100 is 32 with a remainder of 76.

therefore, 
t
≡
76
(
m
o
d
100
)
t≡76(mod100).

but since 
t
t is a two-digit number, 
t
=
76
t=76.

wait, but i need to verify if this is indeed the case. let's check what 
11
×
76
11×76 is.

11
×
76
=
836
11×76=836

yes, the last two digits are 36, so it works.

but the problem says there is a unique two-digit positive integer 
t
t that satisfies this condition, and i found 
t
=
76
t=76. is there any other 
t
t that could satisfy this?

let me think. since we're working modulo 100, and 
t
t is a two-digit number, 
t
t must be between 10 and 99.

from the congruence 
t
≡
76
(
m
o
d
100
)
t≡76(mod100), and considering 
t
t is between 10 and 99, the only solution is 
t
=
76
t=76.

therefore, the unique two-digit positive integer 
t
t is 76.

wait, but let me double-check by trying another method to confirm.

another way to approach this is to express 
11
t
11t as a number ending with 36. so, 
11
t
=
100
k
+
36
11t=100k+36, where 
k
k is some integer.

then, 
t
=
100
k
+
36
11
t= 
11
100k+36
​	
 

since 
t
t must be an integer, 
100
k
+
36
100k+36 must be divisible by 11.

let me check the divisibility by 11.

the rule for divisibility by 11 is that the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is either 0 or a multiple of 11.

but maybe that's not the easiest way here.

alternatively, i can look for 
k
k such that 
100
k
+
36
100k+36 is divisible by 11.

let's set up the equation:

100
k
+
36
≡
0
(
m
o
d
11
)
100k+36≡0(mod11)

since 
100
≡
1
(
m
o
d
11
)
100≡1(mod11) (because 100 divided by 11 is 9 with a remainder of 1), and 36 divided by 11 is 3 with a remainder of 3, so 
36
≡
3
(
m
o
d
11
)
36≡3(mod11).

therefore, the equation becomes:

1
×
k
+
3
≡
0
(
m
o
d
11
)
1×k+3≡0(mod11)

so, 
k
+
3
≡
0
(
m
o
d
11
)
k+3≡0(mod11)

therefore, 
k
≡
−
3
(
m
o
d
11
)
k≡−3(mod11), which is the same as 
k
≡
8
(
m
o
d
11
)
k≡8(mod11), since -3 + 11 = 8.

therefore, 
k
=
11
m
+
8
k=11m+8, where 
m
m is an integer.

now, plugging back into the expression for 
t
t:

t
=
100
k
+
36
11
=
100
(
11
m
+
8
)
+
36
11
=
1100
m
+
800
+
36
11
=
1100
m
+
836
11
=
100
m
+
76
t= 
11
100k+36
​	
 = 
11
100(11m+8)+36
​	
 = 
11
1100m+800+36
​	
 = 
11
1100m+836
​	
 =100m+76

since 
t
t is a two-digit number, 
m
m must be 0, because if 
m
=
1
m=1, then 
t
=
176
t=176, which is a three-digit number.

therefore, 
m
=
0
m=0, and 
t
=
76
t=76, confirming my earlier result.

so, the unique two-digit positive integer 
t
t is indeed 76.

i think that's pretty thorough. i approached it using modular arithmetic and then verified it with another method, and both pointed to 
t
=
76
t=76 being the correct answer.

**final answer**

76
