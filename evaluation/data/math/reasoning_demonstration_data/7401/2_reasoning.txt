Reasoning: 
So i have this problem: "what is the largest number, all of whose digits are 3 or 2, and whose digits add up to 11?" okay, let's break this down.

first, i need to create a number where each digit is either a 2 or a 3. so, possible digits are only 2 and 3. and the sum of all these digits has to be 11.

i think the best way to approach this is to maximize the number, which means i want the number to have as many digits as possible on the left side being as large as possible. since 3 is larger than 2, i should try to have as many 3's as i can.

but, i need to make sure that the sum of the digits is exactly 11. so, i need to figure out how many 3's and 2's i can have such that their sum is 11.

let's denote the number of 3's as 'a' and the number of 2's as 'b'. then, the total sum is 3a + 2b = 11.

i need to find non-negative integer solutions for a and b that satisfy this equation.

let's try to find possible values for a and b.

if a = 0, then 2b = 11, which would mean b = 5.5. but b has to be an integer, so this is not possible.

if a = 1, then 3(1) + 2b = 11 ⇒ 3 + 2b = 11 ⇒ 2b = 8 ⇒ b = 4.

so, one possible combination is 1 three and 4 twos.

if a = 2, then 3(2) + 2b = 11 ⇒ 6 + 2b = 11 ⇒ 2b = 5 ⇒ b = 2.5. not an integer, so invalid.

if a = 3, then 3(3) + 2b = 11 ⇒ 9 + 2b = 11 ⇒ 2b = 2 ⇒ b = 1.

so, another possible combination is 3 threes and 1 two.

if a = 4, then 3(4) + 2b = 11 ⇒ 12 + 2b = 11 ⇒ 2b = -1. that's not possible since b can't be negative.

so, the possible combinations are:

- 1 three and 4 twos.

- 3 threes and 1 two.

now, i need to form the largest possible number from these combinations.

first combination: 1 three and 4 twos.

so, digits are one 3 and four 2's.

to make the largest number, i should arrange the digits in descending order.

so, 3 followed by four 2's: 32222.

second combination: 3 threes and 1 two.

digits are three 3's and one 2.

again, arrange in descending order: 3332.

now, compare 32222 and 3332.

which one is larger? let's see:

32222 is a 5-digit number, while 3332 is a 4-digit number.

5-digit numbers are larger than 4-digit numbers, so 32222 is larger than 3332.

therefore, the largest number under these constraints is 32222.

wait a minute, but maybe there are other combinations i haven't considered.

let me check again.

earlier, i considered a=1 and a=3.

are there any other values for a that give integer b?

let's see:

a=0: b=5.5, invalid.

a=1: b=4, valid.

a=2: b=2.5, invalid.

a=3: b=1, valid.

a=4: b=-0.5, invalid.

so, only two combinations are possible.

alternatively, maybe i can consider leading zeros, but that wouldn't make sense because leading zeros don't count in numbers.

so, 32222 is a 5-digit number, and 3332 is a 4-digit number, so 32222 is larger.

but, perhaps there is a way to arrange the digits differently to get a larger number.

wait, in the first combination, with one 3 and four 2's, arranging them as 32222 is the largest possible.

in the second combination, with three 3's and one 2, arranging them as 3332 is the largest possible.

comparing these, 32222 is larger.

is there a way to get a number with more digits? for example, could i have five 2's and some 3's?

wait, let's think differently.

what if i have more digits, but smaller digits?

for example, if i have five 2's, that's 22222, sum is 10, which is less than 11.

if i have five digits, and sum is 11, i need to adjust.

wait, but in the first combination, i already have one 3 and four 2's, which is 32222, sum is 3+2+2+2+2=11.

alternatively, if i try to make a 6-digit number, what would that look like?

sum is 11, and digits are only 2's and 3's.

if i have six digits, the smallest sum is six 2's, which is 12, which is already larger than 11. so, it's not possible to have a 6-digit number because the minimum sum would be 12, which is more than 11.

therefore, the maximum number of digits possible is five.

and in that case, the largest number is 32222.

alternatively, is there a way to arrange the digits in a way that makes the number larger?

let me check.

for five digits, with one 3 and four 2's, the largest arrangement is 32222.

is there a way to have more 3's in a five-digit number?

well, let's see: three 3's and two 2's would sum to 3*3 + 2*2 = 9 + 4 = 13, which is more than 11.

so, not possible.

two 3's and three 2's sum to 6 + 6 = 12, still more than 11.

only one 3 and four 2's sum to 11.

therefore, 32222 is the largest possible number with digits only 3's and 2's that sum to 11.

i think that's the answer.

**final answer**

32222
