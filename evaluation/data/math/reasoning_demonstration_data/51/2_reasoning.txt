Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: "how many values of 
x
x with 
0
∘
≤
x
<
36
0
∘
0 
∘
 ≤x<360 
∘
  satisfy 
sin
⁡
x
=
−
0.73
sinx=−0.73?" okay, let's break this down.

first off, i know that the sine function is periodic and repeats every 
36
0
∘
360 
∘
 . it oscillates between -1 and 1. so, when it's equal to -0.73, that means we're looking for angles where the sine is negative.

now, sine is negative in the third and fourth quadrants. that is, between 
18
0
∘
180 
∘
  and 
36
0
∘
360 
∘
 . so, there should be two solutions in this range.

let me recall the unit circle. the sine of an angle corresponds to the y-coordinate on the unit circle. so, if 
sin
⁡
x
=
−
0.73
sinx=−0.73, that means the y-coordinate is -0.73.

to find the specific angles, i can use the inverse sine function. so, 
x
=
sin
⁡
−
1
(
−
0.73
)
x=sin 
−1
 (−0.73). but wait, the inverse sine function only gives me one value, usually in the range of 
−
9
0
∘
−90 
∘
  to 
9
0
∘
90 
∘
 , or 
0
∘
0 
∘
  to 
18
0
∘
180 
∘
  depending on the calculator settings. hmm.

actually, most calculators give the principal value of the inverse sine in the range 
−
9
0
∘
−90 
∘
  to 
9
0
∘
90 
∘
 . so, if i take 
sin
⁡
−
1
(
−
0.73
)
sin 
−1
 (−0.73), it should give me an angle in the fourth quadrant, since sine is negative there.

let me calculate that. let's say 
x
1
=
sin
⁡
−
1
(
−
0.73
)
x 
1
​
 =sin 
−1
 (−0.73). then, because sine is also negative in the third quadrant, the other solution should be 
x
2
=
18
0
∘
+
∣
sin
⁡
−
1
(
0.73
)
∣
x 
2
​
 =180 
∘
 +∣sin 
−1
 (0.73)∣, because in the third quadrant, the reference angle is the same as the positive sine value.

wait, let's think about that again. the reference angle for a sine of 0.73 would be 
sin
⁡
−
1
(
0.73
)
sin 
−1
 (0.73), which is in the first quadrant. so, in the third quadrant, it would be 
18
0
∘
+
180 
∘
 + that reference angle.

but since we're dealing with a negative sine value, 
−
0.73
−0.73, the calculator gives us directly the angle in the fourth quadrant. so, 
x
1
=
sin
⁡
−
1
(
−
0.73
)
x 
1
​
 =sin 
−1
 (−0.73), which is negative, but we can convert it to a positive angle by adding 
36
0
∘
360 
∘
 .

wait, actually, most calculators give the inverse sine in degrees between 
−
9
0
∘
−90 
∘
  and 
9
0
∘
90 
∘
 . so, if i have 
sin
⁡
−
1
(
−
0.73
)
sin 
−1
 (−0.73), it'll give me an angle in the fourth quadrant, say 
−
4
7
∘
−47 
∘
 , but since we want angles between 
0
∘
0 
∘
  and 
36
0
∘
360 
∘
 , i can add 
36
0
∘
360 
∘
  to get a positive angle, which would be 
31
3
∘
313 
∘
 .

then, for the third quadrant, i need to find the angle where the sine is also 
−
0.73
−0.73, which would be 
18
0
∘
+
4
7
∘
=
22
7
∘
180 
∘
 +47 
∘
 =227 
∘
 , assuming that 
4
7
∘
47 
∘
  is the reference angle.

wait, let me make sure. if 
sin
⁡
x
=
−
0.73
sinx=−0.73, then the reference angle is 
sin
⁡
−
1
(
0.73
)
sin 
−1
 (0.73), which is approximately 
4
7
∘
47 
∘
 . so, in the third quadrant, it's 
18
0
∘
+
4
7
∘
=
22
7
∘
180 
∘
 +47 
∘
 =227 
∘
 , and in the fourth quadrant, it's 
36
0
∘
−
4
7
∘
=
31
3
∘
360 
∘
 −47 
∘
 =313 
∘
 .

so, the two solutions are 
22
7
∘
227 
∘
  and 
31
3
∘
313 
∘
 . therefore, there are two values of 
x
x that satisfy the equation 
sin
⁡
x
=
−
0.73
sinx=−0.73 in the given range.

wait a minute, is there any other angle within 
0
∘
0 
∘
  to 
36
0
∘
360 
∘
  where sine could be 
−
0.73
−0.73? i don't think so, because sine is negative only in the third and fourth quadrants, and we've covered both of those with these two angles.

just to double-check, i can consider the periodicity of the sine function. since the period is 
36
0
∘
360 
∘
 , and we're only looking within one period from 
0
∘
0 
∘
  to 
36
0
∘
360 
∘
 , there shouldn't be any additional solutions.

also, graphically, if i think about the sine curve between 
0
∘
0 
∘
  and 
36
0
∘
360 
∘
 , it starts at 0, goes up to 1 at 
9
0
∘
90 
∘
 , back to 0 at 
18
0
∘
180 
∘
 , down to -1 at 
27
0
∘
270 
∘
 , and back to 0 at 
36
0
∘
360 
∘
 . so, crossing 
y
=
−
0.73
y=−0.73 should happen twice, once between 
18
0
∘
180 
∘
  and 
27
0
∘
270 
∘
 , and once between 
27
0
∘
270 
∘
  and 
36
0
∘
360 
∘
 , which aligns with the two angles i found.

therefore, i'm confident that there are two values of 
x
x that satisfy 
sin
⁡
x
=
−
0.73
sinx=−0.73 in the given range.
