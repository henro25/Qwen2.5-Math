Answer: To determine how many values of \( x \) with \( 0^\circ \leq x < 360^\circ \) satisfy \( \sin x = -0.73 \), we need to consider the behavior of the sine function in different quadrants.

1. the sine function is negative in the third and fourth quadrants.
2. the reference angle for \( \sin x = 0.73 \) is \( \sin^{-1}(0.73) \), which is approximately \( 47^\circ \).

for the third quadrant:
\[ x = 180^\circ + 47^\circ = 227^\circ \]

for the fourth quadrant:
\[ x = 360^\circ - 47^\circ = 313^\circ \]

thus, the two solutions within the range \( 0^\circ \leq x < 360^\circ \) are \( 227^\circ \) and \( 313^\circ \).

therefore, there are two values of \( x \) that satisfy the equation \( \sin x = -0.73 \).

\[
\boxed{2}
\]
