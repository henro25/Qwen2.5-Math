Answer: Given an ellipse with center \( o \), major axis \( \overline{ab} \), and minor axis \( \overline{cd} \), where \( f \) is one focus and \( of = 6 \). the diameter of the incircle of triangle \( ocf \) is 2, implying the radius is 1. we need to find the product \( (ab)(cd) \).

1. the distance from the center to the focus is \( c = 6 \), and the relationship between the semi-major axis \( a \), semi-minor axis \( b \), and \( c \) is \( c^2 = a^2 - b^2 \). thus, \( 36 = a^2 - b^2 \).

2. the incircle radius \( r \) of triangle \( ocf \) is given by \( r = \frac{a}{s} \), where \( a \) is the area and \( s \) is the semi-perimeter. for triangle \( ocf \):
   - \( oc = b \)
   - \( of = 6 \)
   - \( cf = \sqrt{c^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{36 + b^2} \)

3. the area \( a \) of triangle \( ocf \) is:
   \[
   a = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times b = 3b
   \]

4. the semi-perimeter \( s \) is:
   \[
   s = \frac{b + 6 + \sqrt{36 + b^2}}{2}
   \]

5. given \( r = 1 \), we have:
   \[
   1 = \frac{3b}{\frac{b + 6 + \sqrt{36 + b^2}}{2}} \implies b + 6 + \sqrt{36 + b^2} = 6b
   \]

6. solving for \( b \):
   \[
   \sqrt{36 + b^2} = 5b - 6 \implies 36 + b^2 = 25b^2 - 60b + 36 \implies 24b^2 - 60b = 0 \implies b = \frac{5}{2}
   \]

7. using \( c^2 = a^2 - b^2 \):
   \[
   36 = a^2 - \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^2 \implies 36 = a^2 - \frac{25}{4} \implies a^2 = \frac{169}{4} \implies a = \frac{13}{2}
   \]

8. the lengths of the major and minor axes are:
   \[
   ab = 2a = 13, \quad cd = 2b = 5
   \]

9. therefore, the product is:
   \[
   (ab)(cd) = 13 \times 5 = 65
   \]

\boxed{65}
