Problem: To promote her school's annual Kite Olympics, Genevieve makes a small kite and a large kite for a bulletin board display. For her small kite, Genevieve draws the kite on a grid with the points one inch apart, as shown below.

[asy]
for ( int x = 0; x <= 6; ++x )
{

for ( int y = 0; y <= 7; ++y )

{

dot((x,y));

}
}
draw((0,5)--(3,7)--(6,5)--(3,0)--cycle);
[/asy]

For the large kite she triples both the height and width of the entire grid.

What is the number of square inches in the area of the small kite?
