Reasoning: So i need to find the area of this shaded region in the given figure. let me try to understand the figure first. there's a small square on the left with sides labeled 3 cm each, and a larger rectangle on the right with sides labeled 9 cm each. it looks like the entire figure is made up of these two parts connected together.

first, i'll try to find the coordinates of all the points to better visualize the figure. let's assume the bottom-left corner of the small square is at the origin (0,0). so, the small square has corners at (0,0), (3,0), (3,3), and (0,3). the larger rectangle seems to start from (3,0) to (12,0), then up to (12,9), and back to (3,9), forming a rectangle.

there's also a diagonal line from (0,0) to (12,9). this line divides the figure into two parts. the shaded region is a triangle with vertices at (3, 9/4), (12,9), and (3,9). i need to find the area of this shaded triangle.

hmm, to find the area of a triangle, i can use the formula:

area
=
1
2
×
base
×
height
area= 
2
1
​
 ×base×height
but i need to identify the base and the height of this triangle. let's see, the base could be the horizontal side from (3,9) to (12,9), which is 9 cm long. the height would then be the vertical distance from the base to the point (3, 9/4).

wait, is that correct? actually, in this case, since the base is horizontal, the height should be the vertical distance from the base to the opposite vertex. so, the base is from (3,9) to (12,9), which is indeed 9 cm, and the height is the difference in the y-coordinates from (12,9) or (3,9) to (3, 9/4). so, the height is 
9

  cm.

so, plugging these into the area formula:

but the problem says to round to the nearest square centimeter, so that would be 30 cm².

wait a minute, is there another way to look at this? maybe using coordinates and the shoelace formula for the area of a polygon.

the shoelace formula is:

for the triangle with vertices at (3, 9/4), (12,9), and (3,9):

plugging in the values:

now plug them back in:

now subtract:

so,

again, rounding to the nearest square centimeter gives 30 cm².

wait, both methods give me the same answer, so i'm more confident now.

but just to be thorough, maybe i should check if there's any other interpretation of the shaded region.

looking back at the asymptote code, the shaded region is defined by the points (3, 9/4), (12,9), and (3,9). that seems clear.

alternatively, perhaps i can find the area of the larger triangle formed by (0,0), (12,9), and subtract the area of the unshaded parts.

the line from (0,0) to (12,9) has a slope of 
9
−

=

=

​
 =

​
 =

​
 , so the equation is 
y
=
3

x
y=

​
 x.

the point (3, 9/4) seems to lie on this line because 
y
=

4
×
3
=
9
4
y=

3
​
 ×3=

9
​
 , so yes, it does.

so, the shaded triangle is part of this larger triangle.

alternatively, perhaps i can find the area of the trapezoid or other shapes involved, but i think the initial methods are sufficient.

given that both methods give me 30.375 cm², which rounds to 30 cm², i'll go with that.

**final answer**
