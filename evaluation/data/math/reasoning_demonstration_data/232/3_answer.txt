Answer: Let the total capacity of the tank be \( T \) gallons. Initially, the tank is one-sixth full, meaning it contains \( \frac{T}{6} \) gallons. After adding 130 gallons, the tank becomes three-fifths full, or \( \frac{3T}{5} \) gallons.

We set up the equation:

\[
\frac{T}{6} + 130 = \frac{3T}{5}
\]

To solve for \( T \), subtract \( \frac{T}{6} \) from both sides:

\[
130 = \frac{3T}{5} - \frac{T}{6}
\]

Finding a common denominator of 30 for the fractions:

\[
130 = \frac{18T}{30} - \frac{5T}{30}
\]

Simplify:

\[
130 = \frac{13T}{30}
\]

Multiply both sides by 30:

\[
130 \times 30 = 13T
\]

\[
3900 = 13T
\]

Divide both sides by 13:

\[
T = \frac{3900}{13} = 300
\]

Thus, the tank holds **300 gallons** when completely full.
