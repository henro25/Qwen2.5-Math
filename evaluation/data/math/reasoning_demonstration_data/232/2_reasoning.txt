Reasoning: Okay, so I've got this problem here: A tank is to be filled with water. When the tank is one-sixth full, 130 gallons of water are added, making the tank three-fifths full. I need to find out how many gallons the tank contains when it's completely full.

Alright, let's see. So, the tank starts off being one-sixth full. Then, 130 gallons are added, and after that, it's three-fifths full. I need to find the total capacity of the tank.

Hmm, maybe I can set up an equation for this. Let's say the total capacity of the tank is 'T' gallons. So, initially, the tank has one-sixth of T, which is T/6 gallons. Then, 130 gallons are added, bringing it up to three-fifths of T, which is (3/5)T.

So, the equation would be: T/6 + 130 = 3T/5

Yeah, that seems right. Now, I need to solve for T.

First, maybe I should get all the T terms on one side. Let's subtract T/6 from both sides:

130 = 3T/5 - T/6

Now, I need to combine these fractions. To do that, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 5 and 6, so the least common denominator is 30.

So, 3T/5 is the same as 18T/30, and T/6 is 5T/30.

So, 130 = 18T/30 - 5T/30

That simplifies to 130 = 13T/30

Now, to solve for T, I can multiply both sides by 30:

130 * 30 = 13T

130 times 30 is 3900, so:

3900 = 13T

Now, divide both sides by 13:

T = 3900 / 13

Let me calculate that. 13 times 300 is 3900, so T = 300 gallons.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me check.

If the tank's total capacity is 300 gallons, then one-sixth of that is 50 gallons. Adding 130 gallons would make it 180 gallons. Is 180 gallons three-fifths of 300?

Three-fifths of 300 is indeed 180, so it checks out.

Yeah, I think that's the answer.
