Reasoning: 
So i have this problem here: there are twenty complex roots 
z
1
,
z
2
,
…
,
z
20
z 
1
​
 ,z 
2
​
 ,…,z 
20
​
  of the equation

z
20
−
4
z
19
+
9
z
18
−
16
z
17
+
⋯
+
441
=
0
z 
20
 −4z 
19
 +9z 
18
 −16z 
17
 +⋯+441=0
and i need to calculate 
cot
⁡
(
∑
k
=
1
20
arccot
⁡
z
k
)
cot(∑ 
k=1
20
​
 arccotz 
k
​
 ).

first, i need to understand what this equation is. it looks like a polynomial of degree 20 with alternating signs and coefficients that are perfect squares: 1, 4, 9, 16, ..., up to 441. let's confirm that:

1
2
=
1
1 
2
 =1, 
2
2
=
4
2 
2
 =4, 
3
2
=
9
3 
2
 =9, 
4
2
=
16
4 
2
 =16, ..., 
2
1
2
=
441
21 
2
 =441. wait, but 20 squared is 400, and 21 squared is 441. so, the last term is 441, which is 
2
1
2
21 
2
 . that seems a bit odd because the degree is 20, but the last term is 
z
0
z 
0
 , which should be a constant term, so 441 is correct.

now, i need to find the sum of arccot of these roots and then take the cotangent of that sum.

i recall that the arccot function is the inverse of the cotangent function, so 
arccot
⁡
z
k
arccotz 
k
​
  is the angle whose cotangent is 
z
k
z 
k
​
 . also, there's a formula for the cotangent of a sum of angles, but since there are twenty angles here, that might be complicated.

however, the problem mentions that the addition formula for cotangent is still valid for complex numbers, which is good because the roots are complex.

maybe there's a smarter way to approach this rather than trying to compute the sum directly.

let me think about properties of roots of polynomials. for a polynomial equation of degree 
n
n, the sum of the roots is related to the coefficients, specifically, it's 
−
a
n
−
1
a
n
− 
a 
n
​
 
a 
n−1
​
 
​
 , where 
a
n
a 
n
​
  is the leading coefficient and 
a
n
−
1
a 
n−1
​
  is the coefficient of 
z
n
−
1
z 
n−1
 .

in this case, the polynomial is:

z
20
−
4
z
19
+
9
z
18
−
16
z
17
+
⋯
+
441
=
0
z 
20
 −4z 
19
 +9z 
18
 −16z 
17
 +⋯+441=0
so, the sum of the roots 
∑
k
=
1
20
z
k
=
4
∑ 
k=1
20
​
 z 
k
​
 =4, because 
−
−
4
1
=
4
− 
1
−4
​
 =4.

but i need the sum of arccot of the roots, not the sum of the roots themselves.

hmm. maybe there's a relationship between the arccot of the roots and some property of the polynomial.

alternatively, perhaps there's a way to relate the sum of arccot to some kind of logarithm or something, but that seems too vague.

wait a minute, i recall that there's an identity involving the cotangent of a sum:

cot
⁡
(
a
+
b
)
=
cot
⁡
a
cot
⁡
b
−
1
cot
⁡
a
+
cot
⁡
b
cot(a+b)= 
cota+cotb
cotacotb−1
​
 
but extending this to twenty terms would be messy.

alternatively, maybe there's a way to consider the product of terms involving the cotangent or something like that.

let me consider the identity for cotangent of a sum for multiple angles. there's a general formula for the cotangent of a sum of angles, but it's quite complicated for more than a few angles.

alternatively, perhaps i can use properties of logarithms or exponents, since cotangent is related to exponential functions in the complex plane.

wait, another thought: there's a relationship between the sum of arccot functions and the logarithm of a certain function, but i'm not sure.

let me try to recall if there's a formula for the sum of arccot terms.

actually, i think there's a formula that relates the sum of arccot terms to the difference of angles, but again, with twenty terms, it seems unwieldy.

maybe i should consider the tangent of the sum instead, since tangent is the reciprocal of cotangent.

so, if i let 
s
=
∑
k
=
1
20
arccot
⁡
z
k
s=∑ 
k=1
20
​
 arccotz 
k
​
 , then 
cot
⁡
s
cots is what i need to find.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that 
arccot
⁡
z
k
=
arctan
⁡
(
1
z
k
)
arccotz 
k
​
 =arctan( 
z 
k
​
 
1
​
 ), since 
cot
⁡
θ
=
1
tan
⁡
θ
cotθ= 
tanθ
1
​
 .

so, 
s
=
∑
k
=
1
20
arctan
⁡
(
1
z
k
)
s=∑ 
k=1
20
​
 arctan( 
z 
k
​
 
1
​
 ).

but even then, summing up twenty arctangent terms is not straightforward.

wait, maybe there's a way to relate this sum to the argument of a product or a sum of complex numbers.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the product of terms involving 
z
k
z 
k
​
 , but i'm not sure.

let me look back at the polynomial. the coefficients are squares of integers with alternating signs.

let me see if there's a pattern or a generating function that can help me here.

wait a minute, the coefficients are 
(
−
1
)
n
n
2
(−1) 
n
 n 
2
  for 
n
=
1
n=1 to 
21
21, but the degree is 20, so perhaps the pattern is 
(
−
1
)
n
n
2
(−1) 
n
 n 
2
  for 
n
=
1
n=1 to 
20
20, and the constant term is 
2
1
2
21 
2
 .

but i need to confirm the pattern of the coefficients.

looking at the polynomial:

z
20
−
4
z
19
+
9
z
18
−
16
z
17
+
⋯
+
441
=
0
z 
20
 −4z 
19
 +9z 
18
 −16z 
17
 +⋯+441=0
so, coefficients are 
1
,
−
4
,
9
,
−
16
,
…
,
441
1,−4,9,−16,…,441, which correspond to 
1
2
,
−
2
2
,
3
2
,
−
4
2
,
…
,
2
1
2
1 
2
 ,−2 
2
 ,3 
2
 ,−4 
2
 ,…,21 
2
 .

wait, but 21^2 is 441, and the degree is 20, so the constant term is 441.

so, the general term seems to be 
(
−
1
)
n
+
1
n
2
z
20
−
n
+
1
(−1) 
n+1
 n 
2
 z 
20−n+1
  for 
n
=
1
n=1 to 
20
20, plus the constant term 441.

alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the general term as 
(
−
1
)
n
(
n
+
1
)
2
z
19
−
n
(−1) 
n
 (n+1) 
2
 z 
19−n
 , but i'm not sure.

maybe i should look for a generating function or a pattern that can help me find the sum of the arccot of the roots.

alternatively, perhaps there's a generating function or a transformation that can relate the roots of this polynomial to the sum of their arccot.

wait, another idea: perhaps consider the logarithm of the polynomial.

for a polynomial 
p
(
z
)
=
∏
k
=
1
20
(
z
−
z
k
)
p(z)=∏ 
k=1
20
​
 (z−z 
k
​
 ), the logarithm is 
log
⁡
p
(
z
)
=
∑
k
=
1
20
log
⁡
(
z
−
z
k
)
logp(z)=∑ 
k=1
20
​
 log(z−z 
k
​
 ).

but i'm not sure how that helps with the sum of arccot of the roots.

alternatively, maybe i can consider the derivative of the polynomial, but again, not sure.

wait, perhaps consider that 
arccot
⁡
z
k
arccotz 
k
​
  is related to the argument of 
z
k
z 
k
​
 , but since 
z
k
z 
k
​
  are roots of the polynomial, they are complex numbers, and their arguments are angles in the complex plane.

but summing up those arguments might relate to the argument of the product of 
z
k
z 
k
​
 , but i'm not sure.

actually, the argument of the product of 
z
k
z 
k
​
  is the sum of the arguments of 
z
k
z 
k
​
 , but 
arccot
⁡
z
k
arccotz 
k
​
  is not exactly the argument of 
z
k
z 
k
​
 , unless 
z
k
z 
k
​
  is positive real, which they are not necessarily.

wait, let's recall that for a complex number 
z
=
x
+
i
y
z=x+iy, 
arccot
⁡
z
arccotz is not typically defined, or at least not in the standard real arccotangent function.

but the problem says that the addition formula for cotangent is still valid for complex numbers, so perhaps we can extend the arccot function to complex arguments in a meaningful way.

alternatively, perhaps we can consider the identity involving the cotangent of a sum.

let me look up the formula for the cotangent of a sum of multiple angles.

upon checking, i find that for two angles, 
cot
⁡
(
a
+
b
)
=
cot
⁡
a
cot
⁡
b
−
1
cot
⁡
a
+
cot
⁡
b
cot(a+b)= 
cota+cotb
cotacotb−1
​
 , but for more angles, the formula becomes more complicated.

for three angles, it's more involved, and for twenty angles, it's impractical to use directly.

so, perhaps that's not the way to go.

maybe there's another approach.

let me consider that 
arccot
⁡
z
k
arccotz 
k
​
  can be expressed in terms of logarithms, since in complex analysis, inverse trigonometric functions can be expressed using logarithms.

specifically, 
arccot
⁡
z
=
i
2
ln
⁡
(
z
+
i
z
−
i
)
arccotz= 
2
i
​
 ln( 
z−i
z+i
​
 ).

but summing up twenty such logarithmic terms would give 
s
=
i
2
∑
k
=
1
20
ln
⁡
(
z
k
+
i
z
k
−
i
)
=
i
2
ln
⁡
(
∏
k
=
1
20
z
k
+
i
z
k
−
i
)
s= 
2
i
​
 ∑ 
k=1
20
​
 ln( 
z 
k
​
 −i
z 
k
​
 +i
​
 )= 
2
i
​
 ln(∏ 
k=1
20
​
  
z 
k
​
 −i
z 
k
​
 +i
​
 ).

then, 
cot
⁡
s
=
cot
⁡
(
i
2
ln
⁡
(
∏
k
=
1
20
z
k
+
i
z
k
−
i
)
)
cots=cot( 
2
i
​
 ln(∏ 
k=1
20
​
  
z 
k
​
 −i
z 
k
​
 +i
​
 )), which seems even more complicated.

maybe this is not the right path.

let me try to think differently.

perhaps there's a way to relate the sum 
∑
k
=
1
20
arccot
⁡
z
k
∑ 
k=1
20
​
 arccotz 
k
​
  to some integral or another function involving the roots.

alternatively, maybe consider generating functions or symmetric sums.

wait, perhaps i can consider the logarithmic derivative of the polynomial.

the logarithmic derivative of 
p
(
z
)
p(z) is 
p
′
(
z
)
/
p
(
z
)
=
∑
k
=
1
20
1
z
−
z
k
p 
′
 (z)/p(z)=∑ 
k=1
20
​
  
z−z 
k
​
 
1
​
 .

but i don't see immediately how that helps with the sum of arccot of the roots.

wait, another idea: perhaps use the fact that 
arccot
⁡
z
k
arccotz 
k
​
  can be related to 
arctan
⁡
(
1
/
z
k
)
arctan(1/z 
k
​
 ), and then use properties of arctangent addition.

but summing twenty arctangent terms is still not straightforward.

alternatively, perhaps consider the imaginary part of the logarithm or something like that, but again, it seems too vague.

maybe i need to consider specific properties of the polynomial.

looking back at the polynomial:

p
(
z
)
=
z
20
−
4
z
19
+
9
z
18
−

+
441
p(z)=z 
20
 −4z 
19
 +9z 
18
 −16z 
17
 +⋯+441
i notice that the coefficients are 
n
2
n 
2
  with alternating signs, but not exactly sure about the pattern.

wait, the coefficients are 
(
−
1
)
n
+
1
n
2
(−1) 
n+1
 n 
2
  for 
n
=
1
n=1 to 
20
20, and the constant term is 
2
1
2
=
441
21 
2
 =441.

is there a generating function or a closed-form expression for such a polynomial?

alternatively, perhaps consider that this polynomial can be expressed in terms of a product involving its roots.

wait, but that's generally true for any polynomial: 
p
(
z
)
=
∏
k
=
1
20
(
z
−
z
k
)
p(z)=∏ 
k=1
20
​
 (z−z 
k
​
 ).

but i need to relate this to the sum of arccot of the roots.

alternatively, maybe consider a transformation of the variable to make the polynomial simpler.

for example, let 
w
=
z
−
a
w=z−a, for some 
a
a, to shift the polynomial and perhaps make the coefficients more manageable.

but without knowing what 
a
a to choose, that seems risky.

alternatively, perhaps consider factoring the polynomial, but factoring a 20th-degree polynomial is not practical.

wait, perhaps there's a pattern in the exponents and coefficients that can be exploited.

looking back, the coefficients are 
1
,
−
4
,
9
,
−
16

…
,
441
1,−4,9,−16,…,441, which are

2
 , but the degrees are decreasing from 20 to 0.

wait, actually, if i write the general term, it seems that for 
z
20
−
n
z 
20−n
 , the coefficient is 
(
−
1
)
n
(
n

)
2
(−1) 
n
 (n+1) 
2
  for 
n
=
0
n=0 to 
20
20, with the constant term being 
2

2
21 
2
 .

wait, for 
n
=
0
n=0, 
z

z

 , coefficient 1, which is 
(
−
1
)
0
(

)
2
=
1
(−1) 
0
 (1) 
2
 =1, but 
n

1
=

n+1=1, so yes, 
(
−
1
)
0
(
1
)
2
=

(−1) 
0
 (1) 
2
 =1.

for 
n
=

z

 , coefficient -4, which is 
(

(−1)

 (2) 
2
 =−4.

for 
n

 , coefficient 9, which is 
(

2

and so on, up to

2
=

(−1)

so, the general term is

(−1) 
n

 z

  for 
n

alternatively, i can write the polynomial as:

p

n

p(z)= 
n=0
∑
20
​
 (−1) 
n
 (n+1) 
2
 z 
20−n
 =0
but i need to find a way to relate this to the sum of arccot of the roots.

this is tricky. maybe i need to think about the relationship between the roots and the coefficients in a different way.

let me recall that for a polynomial 
p
(
z
)
=
∏
k
=
1
n
(
z
−
z
k
)
p(z)=∏ 
k=1
n
​
 (z−z 
k
​
 ), the sum of the roots is 
−
a
n
−
1
a
n
− 
a 
n
​
 
a 
n−1
​
 
​
 , the sum of the products of roots taken two at a time is 
a
n
−
2
a
n
a 
n
​
 
a 
n−2
​
 
​
 , and so on, according to vieta's formulas.

but i don't see how that directly helps with the sum of arccot of the roots.

wait, perhaps consider that the cotangent of a sum can be expressed in terms of the cotangents of individual angles, but again, with twenty angles, that seems unwieldy.

alternatively, perhaps consider the imaginary parts or real parts of some expression involving the roots.

wait, perhaps consider that 
cot
⁡
(
θ
)
=
cos
⁡
θ
sin
⁡
θ
cot(θ)= 
sinθ
cosθ
​
 , and see if there's a way to relate that to the roots.

alternatively, maybe consider that 
cot
⁡
(
∑
θ
k
)
cot(∑θ 
k
​
 ) can be expressed in terms of the products and sums of 
cot
⁡
θ
k
cotθ 
k
​
 , but again, with twenty terms, it's not obvious.

maybe i need to consider a different approach altogether.

let me consider if there's any symmetry or special property in the polynomial that can be exploited.

looking at the coefficients, they are 
n
2
n 
2
  with alternating signs, which suggests that the polynomial might be related to the derivative of some other polynomial or to a generating function involving squares.

alternatively, perhaps consider generating a generating function whose coefficients are 
n
2
n 
2
 , but with alternating signs.

wait, i recall that the generating function for 
n
2
n 
2
  is 
z
(
z
+
1
)
(
1
−
z
)
3
(1−z) 
3
 
z(z+1)
​
 , but with alternating signs, it would be 
z
(
z
−
1
)
(
1
+
z
)
3
(1+z) 
3
 
z(z−1)
​
 , but i'm not sure.

alternatively, perhaps consider that the coefficients are 
(
−
1
)
n
(
n
+
1
)
2
(−1) 
n
 (n+1) 
2
 , and see if this polynomial can be expressed in terms of a known function.

alternatively, maybe consider that 
(
n
+
1
)
2
=
n
2
+
2
n
+
1
(n+1) 
2
 =n 
2
 +2n+1, so perhaps decompose the polynomial into simpler polynomials with coefficients 
n
2
n 
2
 , 
2
n
2n, and 1, but that seems messy.

wait, perhaps consider that 
(
n
+
1
)
2
=
(
n
+
1
)
(
n
+
1
)
(n+1) 
2
 =(n+1)(n+1), and see if there's a way to factor the polynomial using this.

alternatively, maybe consider the generating function for 
(
n
+
1
)
2
(n+1) 
2
 , but i don't recall it off the top of my head.

this seems like a dead end.

let me consider another approach.

perhaps consider that the sum 
s

  can be expressed in terms of the argument of some function involving the roots.

alternatively, maybe consider that

z
k
arccotz 
k
​
  is related to the logarithm of 
z
k
+
i
z 
k
​
 +i or something similar.

wait, i think there's a relationship between 
arccot
⁡
z
arccotz and the logarithm function in the complex plane.

specifically, 
arccot
⁡
z
=
i
2
ln
⁡
(
z
+
i
z
−
i
)
arccotz= 
2

​
 ln(

so,

∑

s=∑

 ln(

i
​
 ln(∏

​
 ).

then, 
cot

​
 ln(∏ 
k=1

​

​

z

​
 )).

this seems too complicated to work with directly.

maybe there's a better way.

let me consider that 
cot
⁡
cot is the reciprocal of 
tan
⁡
tan, and 
tan
⁡
tan of a sum has addition formulas, but again, with twenty terms, it's not helpful.

alternatively, perhaps consider using the identity for the tangent of a sum, but in reverse, to express the cotangent of a sum.

wait, perhaps consider that 
cot
⁡
(
s
)
=
1
tan
⁡
(
s
)
cot(s)= 
tan(s)
1
​
 , and if i can find 
tan
⁡
(
s
)
tan(s), then i can take its reciprocal.

but finding 
tan
⁡
(
s
)
tan(s) where 
s
s is the sum of twenty arccot terms still seems too difficult.

let me try to think differently.

maybe consider that the sum of arccot of the roots is related to the argument of the product of 
z
k
+
i
z 
k
​
 +i over 
z
k
−
i
z 
k
​
 −i, as i had earlier, and see if i can find a way to compute that product.

given that the 
z
k
z 
k
​
  are roots of the polynomial 
p
(
z
)
p(z), perhaps i can express the product 
∏
k
=
1
20
z
k
+
i
z
k
−
i
∏ 
k=1
20
​
  
z 
k
​
 −i
z 
k
​
 +i
​
  in terms of the polynomial evaluated at certain points.

specifically, 
∏
k
=
1
20
(
z
k
−
a
)
=
p
(
a
)
∏ 
k=1
20
​
 (z 
k
​
 −a)=p(a), for any 
a
a, since 
p
(
z
)
=
∏
k
=
1
20
(
z
−
z
k
)
p(z)=∏ 
k=1
20
​
 (z−z 
k
​
 ).

so, 
∏
k
=
1
20
(
z
k
−
a
)
=
p
(
a
)
∏ 
k=1
20
​
 (z 
k
​
 −a)=p(a), but with 
z
k
z 
k
​
  in the denominator, it's a bit tricky.

wait, perhaps consider that 
∏
k
=
1
20
z
k
+
i
z
k
−
i
=
∏
k
=
1
20
1

​
 =∏ 
k=1
20
​
  
1−i/z 
k
​
 
1+i/z 
k
​
 
​
 .

then, if i set 
w
k
=
1
/
z
k
w 
k
​
 =1/z 
k
​
 , this becomes 
∏
k
=

1
+
i
w
k
1
−
i
w
k
∏ 
k=1
20
​
  
1−iw 
k
​
 
1+iw 
k
​
 
​
 .

but 
w
k
=
1
/
z
k
w 
k
​
 =1/z 
k
​
 , and since 
z
k
z 
k
​
  are roots of 
p

z

=
0
p(z)=0, then 
w
k
w 
k
​
  are roots of 
p
(
1

w
)
=
0
p(1/w)=0, which is 
(
1

w
)
20
−
4
(
1
/
w
)
19
+
9
(
1

w
)
18
−
⋯
+
441
=
0
(1/w) 
20
 −4(1/w) 
19
 +9(1/w) 
18
 −⋯+441=0, or multiplying both sides by 
w
20
w 
20
 , we get 
1
−
4
w
+
9
w
2
−
16
w
3
+
⋯
+
441
w
20
=
0
1−4w+9w 
2
 −16w 
3
 +⋯+441w 
20
 =0.

so, the polynomial for 
w
w is:

441
w
20
+
⋯
−
16
w
3
+
9
w
2
−
4
w
+
1
=
0
441w 
20
 +⋯−16w 
3
 +9w 
2
 −4w+1=0
this seems like the reverse of the original polynomial, with coefficients in reverse order.

but i'm not sure if this helps.

alternatively, maybe consider that 
∏
k
=
1
20
z
k
+
i
z
k
−
i
=
∏

 +i
​
 =∏ 
k=1
20
​
 (1+ 
z 
k
​
 −i
2i
​
 ), but that doesn't seem immediately useful.

this is getting too complicated. maybe i need to consider a different approach.

let me consider that 
arccot
⁡
z
k
arccotz 
k
​
  can be expressed in terms of 
arctan
⁡
(
1
/
z
k
)
arctan(1/z 
k
​
 ), as i thought earlier.

so, 
s
=
∑
k
=
1
20
arctan
⁡
(
1
z
k
)
s=∑ 
k=1
20
​
 arctan( 
z 
k
​
 
1
​
 ).

now, perhaps consider that 
arctan
⁡
(
a
)
+
arctan
⁡
(
b
)
=
arctan
⁡
(
a
+
b
1
−
a
b
)
arctan(a)+arctan(b)=arctan( 
1−ab
a+b
​
 ), but again, with twenty terms, it's not helpful.

alternatively, perhaps consider the imaginary part of the logarithm of a product, but that seems similar to what i did earlier.

wait, maybe consider that the sum of arctangent functions can be related to the argument of a product, but again, not directly helpful.

alternatively, perhaps consider that the sum of arccot functions can be expressed in terms of the logarithm of a ratio involving the roots, but i need a better way to proceed.

let me think about the properties of the cotangent function.

i know that 
cot
⁡
(
θ
)
=
cos
⁡
θ
sin
⁡
θ
cot(θ)= 
sinθ
cosθ
​
 , and that 
cot
⁡
(
θ
+
ϕ
)
=
cot
⁡
θ
cot
⁡
ϕ
−
1
cot
⁡
θ
+
cot
⁡
ϕ
cot(θ+ϕ)= 
cotθ+cotϕ
cotθcotϕ−1
​
 , as i mentioned earlier.

but for multiple angles, this formula becomes too complicated.

perhaps there's a generating function or a series expansion that can help me find 
cot
⁡
(
s
)
cot(s) in terms of the 
z
k
z 
k
​
 .

alternatively, maybe consider that the sum 
s
s is related to the logarithmic derivative of some function involving the roots.

wait, let's consider the logarithmic derivative of 
p
(
z
)
p(z):

p
′
(
z
)
p
(
z
)
=
∑
k
=
1
20

z
−
z
k
p(z)
p 
′
 (z)
​
 = 
k=1
∑
20
​
  
z−z 
k
​
 
1
​
 
but i need to relate this to the sum of 
arccot
⁡
z
k
arccotz 
k
​
 , which doesn't seem directly connected.

alternatively, perhaps consider integrating or differentiating some expression involving 
p
(
z
)
p(z), but i don't see a clear path.

this is getting frustrating. maybe i need to look for a different strategy altogether.

let me consider that the problem mentions that the addition formula for cotangent is still valid for complex numbers.

perhaps i can consider that 
cot
⁡
(
s
)
cot(s) can be expressed in terms of the roots 
z
k
z 
k
​
 , but i need to find a way to relate them.

alternatively, maybe consider that the sum 
s
s is related to the argument of a certain complex function evaluated at the roots.

wait, perhaps consider that 
arccot
⁡
z
k
=
arg
⁡
(
1
+
i
z
k
)
arccotz 
k
​
 =arg(1+iz 
k
​
 ), since 
cot
⁡
θ
=
cos
⁡
θ
sin
⁡
θ
=
adjacent
opposite
cotθ= 
sinθ
cosθ
​
 = 
opposite
adjacent
​
 , and in the complex plane, 
1
+
i
z
k
1+iz 
k
​
  has a certain argument.

but i'm not sure if that's accurate.

alternatively, perhaps consider that 
arccot
⁡
z
k
=
arctan
⁡
(
1
z
k
)
arccotz 
k
​
 =arctan( 
z 
k
​
 
1
​
 ), and relate that to the argument of 
z
k
+
i
z 
k
​
 +i, but again, not sure.

maybe i need to look for a different identity or formula that can help me relate the sum of arccot terms to something more manageable.

alternatively, perhaps consider using the fact that the cotangent function is periodic and has certain symmetry properties, but with complex arguments, that might not help.

wait, perhaps consider that 
cot
⁡
(
s
)
cot(s) can be expressed in terms of the exponential function, since 
cot
⁡
θ
=
e
i
θ
+
e
−
i
θ
i
(
e
i

e

e

i
θ
cotθ= 
i(e

−iθ
 
​
 = 
e 
iθ
 −e 
−iθ
 
i(e 
iθ
 +e 
−iθ
 )
​
 , but that seems too complicated for this context.

this seems like a dead end.

let me try to consider a different approach.

perhaps consider that the polynomial 
p
(
z
)
p(z) can be related to some known function whose roots have properties that can help me find the sum of their arccot.

alternatively, perhaps consider that the polynomial is related to the derivative of another polynomial, but i don't see how that would help.

wait, another thought: perhaps consider the reciprocal polynomial or some transformation that can make the polynomial simpler.

for example, if i let 
w
=
z
−
1
w=z 
−1
 , then 
p
(
z
)
=
z
20
q
(
w
)
p(z)=z 
20
 q(w), where 
q
(
w
)
=
1
−
4
w
+
9
w
2
−
16
w
3
+
⋯
+
441
w
20
q(w)=1−4w+9w 
2
 −16w 
3
 +⋯+441w 
20
 .

but i don't see how that helps with the sum of arccot of the roots.

alternatively, perhaps consider that the roots 
z
k
z 
k
​
  satisfy 
p
(
z
k
)
=
0
p(z 
k
​
 )=0, and see if that can be used to express 
cot
⁡
(
s
)
cot(s) in terms of the coefficients.

but i still don't see a direct connection.

let me consider numerical examples or smaller cases to see if i can find a pattern.

suppose i have a simpler polynomial, say 
z
2
−
a
z
+
b
=
0
z 
2
 −az+b=0, with roots 
z
1
z 
1
​
  and 
z
2
z 
2
​
 .

then, 
z
1
+
z
2
=
a
z 
1
​
 +z 
2
​
 =a and 
z
1
z
2
=
b
z 
1
​
 z 
2
​
 =b.

now, what is 
cot
⁡
(
arccot
⁡
z
1
+
arccot
⁡
z
2
)
cot(arccotz 
1
​
 +arccotz 
2
​
 )?

using the addition formula for cotangent:

cot
⁡
(
α
+
β
)
=
cot
⁡
α
cot
⁡
β
−
1
cot
⁡
α
+
cot
⁡
β
cot(α+β)= 
cotα+cotβ
cotαcotβ−1
​
 
so, 
cot
⁡
(
arccot
⁡
z
1
+
arccot
⁡
z
2
)
=
z
1
z
2
−
1
z
1
+
z
2
cot(arccotz 
1
​
 +arccotz 
2
​
 )= 
z 
1
​
 +z 
2
​
 
z 
1
​
 z 
2
​
 −1
​
 .

interesting! so, in this case, 
cot
⁡
(
arccot
⁡
z
1
+
arccot
⁡
z
2
)
=
z
1
z
2
−
1
z
1
+
z
2
=
b
−
1
a
cot(arccotz 
1
​
 +arccotz 
2
​
 )= 
z 
1
​
 +z 
2
​
 
z 
1
​
 z 
2
​
 −1
​
 = 
a
b−1
​
 .

that's a neat result.

so, for a quadratic polynomial, the cotangent of the sum of arccot of its roots is 
b
−
1
a
a
b−1
​
 , where 
a
a is the coefficient of 
z
z and 
b
b is the constant term.

now, perhaps this can be generalized to higher-degree polynomials.

suppose i have a cubic polynomial 
z
3
−
a
z
2
+
b
z
−
c
=
0
z 
3
 −az 
2
 +bz−c=0, with roots 
z
1
,
z
2
,
z
3
z 
1
​
 ,z 
2
​
 ,z 
3
​
 .

then, what is 
cot
⁡
(
arccot
⁡
z
1
+
arccot
⁡
z
2
+
arccot
⁡
z
3
)
cot(arccotz 
1
​
 +arccotz 
2
​
 +arccotz 
3
​
 )?

using the addition formula for cotangent, it would be:

cot
⁡
(
α
+
β
+
γ
)
=
cot
⁡
α
cot
⁡
β
cot
⁡
γ
−
cot
⁡
α
−
cot
⁡
β
−
cot
⁡
γ
cot
⁡
α
cot
⁡
β
+
cot
⁡
α
cot
⁡
γ
+
cot
⁡
β
cot
⁡
γ
−
1
cot(α+β+γ)= 
cotαcotβ+cotαcotγ+cotβcotγ−1
cotαcotβcotγ−cotα−cotβ−cotγ
​
 
but this seems messy, and i'm not sure how to relate it to the coefficients of the polynomial.

alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to generalize the result from the quadratic case.

in the quadratic case, 
cot
⁡
(
arccot
⁡
z
1
+
arccot
⁡
z
2
)
=
z
1
z
2
−
1
z
1
+
z
2
=
b
−
1
a
cot(arccotz 
1
​
 +arccotz 
2
​
 )= 
z 
1
​
 +z 
2
​
 
z 
1
​
 z 
2
​
 −1
​
 = 
a
b−1
​
 .

maybe for the cubic case, there's a similar expression involving the coefficients.

but i don't know the exact formula, and deriving it for a general case would be time-consuming.

given that, perhaps i can look for a pattern or a general formula for the sum of arccot of roots of a polynomial.

alternatively, maybe consider that for the sum of multiple arccot terms, the cotangent can be expressed in terms of the determinants or some symmetric functions of the roots.

but this is getting too abstract.

wait, perhaps consider that in the quadratic case, 
cot
⁡
(
s
)
=
b
−
1
a
cot(s)= 
a
b−1
​
 , where 
a
=
z
1
+
z
2
a=z 
1
​
 +z 
2
​
  and 
b
=
z
1
z
2
b=z 
1
​
 z 
2
​
 .

in the general case, for a degree 
n
n polynomial, perhaps 
cot
⁡
(
s
)
cot(s) can be expressed in terms of the symmetric sums of the roots.

specifically, perhaps 
cot
⁡
(
s
)
cot(s) is equal to 
σ
2
−
(
n
2
)
σ
1
σ 
1
​
 
σ 
2
​
 −( 
2
n
​
 )
​
 , or something similar, but i need to think carefully.

alternatively, perhaps consider that in the quadratic case, 
cot
⁡
(
s
)
=
σ
2
−
1
σ
1
cot(s)= 
σ 
1
​
 
σ 
2
​
 −1
​
 , where 
σ
1
=
z
1
+
z
2
σ 
1
​
 =z 
1
​
 +z 
2
​
  and 
σ
2
=
z
1
z
2
σ 
2
​
 =z 
1
​
 z 
2
​
 .

maybe in the general case, 
cot
⁡
(
s
)
=
σ
2
−
(
n

)
σ
1
cot(s)= 
σ 
1
​
 
σ 
2
​
 −( 
2
n
​
 )
​
 , but i need to confirm this.

alternatively, perhaps there's a general formula involving all the symmetric sums up to a certain degree.

this seems too vague.

given that, perhaps i need to consider that the sum 
s
=
∑
k
=
1
20
arccot
⁡
z
k
s=∑ 
k=1
20
​
 arccotz 
k
​
  can be expressed in terms of the logarithm of a certain function, as i tried earlier, and then find 
cot
⁡
(
s
)
cot(s) accordingly.

alternatively, perhaps consider that the sum of arccot terms can be expressed in terms of the argument of a product of terms involving the roots.

but this seems similar to what i did earlier and didn't lead anywhere.

wait, perhaps consider that 
∑

 ), but i need to confirm that.

in the real case, 
arccot
⁡
x
=
arg
⁡
(
1
+
i
x
)
arccotx=arg(1+ix), since 
cot
⁡
θ
=
cos
⁡
θ
sin
⁡
θ
=
re
(
1
+
i
x
)
im
(
1
+
i
x
)
cotθ= 
sinθ
cosθ
​
 = 
im(1+ix)
re(1+ix)
​
 , but for complex 
z
k
z 
k
​
 , this might not hold.

moreover, even if it does, summing up the arguments of twenty complex numbers is not straightforward.

this is proving to be very challenging.

maybe i need to consider that the sum of arccot of the roots is related to the argument of the product of 
1
+
i
z
k
1+iz 
k
​
 , but again, without knowing the specific values of 
z
k
z 
k
​
 , it's hard to proceed.

alternatively, perhaps consider that the sum 
s
s is related to the logarithm of the product 
∏
k
=
1
20
1
+
i
z
k
1
−
i
z
k
∏ 
k=1
20
​
  
1−iz 
k
​
 
1+iz 
k
​
 
​
 , as i did earlier, and see if there's a way to express this product in terms of the polynomial 
p
(
z
)
p(z).

specifically, since 
p
(
z
)
=
∏
k
=
1
20
(
z
−
z
k
)
p(z)=∏ 
k=1
20
​
 (z−z 
k
​
 ), perhaps i can relate 
∏
k
=
1
20
1
+
i
z
k
1
−
i
z
k
∏ 
k=1
20
​
  
1−iz 
k
​
 
1+iz 
k
​
 
​
  to 
p
(
i
)
p(i) and 
p
(
−
i
)
p(−i), since 
z
=
i
z=i and 
z
=
−
i
z=−i are related to the denominator and numerator.

indeed, 
∏
k
=
1
20
(
i
−
z
k
)
=
p
(
i
)
∏ 
k=1
20
​
 (i−z 
k
​
 )=p(i) and 
∏
k
=
1
20
(
−
i
−
z
k
)
=
p
(
−
i
)
∏ 
k=1
20
​
 (−i−z 
k
​
 )=p(−i).

wait, more precisely, 
∏
k
=
1
20
(
i
−
z
k
)
=
p
(
i
)
∏ 
k=1
20
​
 (i−z 
k
​
 )=p(i) and 
∏
k
=
1
20
(
−
i
−
z
k
)
=
p
(
−
i
)
∏ 
k=1
20
​
 (−i−z 
k
​
 )=p(−i).

therefore, 
∏
k
=
1
20
1
+
i
z
k
1
−
i
z
k
=
∏
k

z

=
∏

(

∏

(

=
p

p

)
∏

∏ 
k=1
20
​
 (z 
k
​

​
 = 
p(i)
p(−i)
​
 .

that's a useful relationship!

so, 
∏
k
=

20
z

z

=
p
(

​

​
 =

​
 .

therefore,

arccot

ln

(

ln

​
 ln(∏

​

z

​
 )= 
2
i
​
 ln( 
p(i)
p(−i)
​
 ).

then, 
cot

(
s

=
cot

(
i

ln
⁡
(
p

p

)
)
)
cot(s)=cot( 
2
i
​
 ln( 
p(i)
p(−i)
​
 )).

now, i need to find a way to express 
cot
⁡
cot of this expression in terms of 
p
(
i
)
p(i) and 
p
(
−
i
)
p(−i).

this seems promising.

first, let's compute 
p
(
i
)
p(i) and 
p
(
−
i
)
p(−i).

given 
p
(
z
)
=
z
20
−
4
z
19
+
9
z
18
−
16
z
17
+
⋯
+
441
p(z)=z 
20
 −4z 
19
 +9z 
18
 −16z 
17
 +⋯+441, we can plug in 
z
=
i
z=i and 
z
=
−
i
z=−i.

but computing 
p
(
i
)
p(i) and 
p
(
−
i
)
p(−i) directly would be time-consuming due to the high degree of the polynomial.

perhaps there's a smarter way to compute 
p
(
i
)
p(i) and 
p
(
−
i
)
p(−i).

let me recall that 
i
i is the imaginary unit, where 
i
2
=
−
1
i 
2
 =−1, and 
(
−
i
)
2
=
−
1
(−i) 
2
 =−1, and so on.

also, powers of 
i
i cycle every four exponents:

i
0
=
1
i 
0
 =1

i
1
=
i
i 
1
 =i

i
2
=
−
1
i 
2
 =−1

i
3
=
−
i
i 
3
 =−i

i
4
=
1
i 
4
 =1, and so on.

similarly for 
(
−
i
)
(−i):

(
−
i
)
0
=
1
(−i) 
0
 =1

(
−
i
)
1
=
−
i
(−i) 
1
 =−i

(
−
i
)
2
=
−
1
(−i) 
2
 =−1

(
−
i
)
3
=
i
(−i) 
3
 =i

(
−
i
)
4
=
1
(−i) 
4
 =1, and so on.

given that, perhaps i can find a pattern or a simplification for 
p
(
i
)
p(i) and 
p
(
−
i
)
p(−i).

let me consider 
p
(
i
)
=
∑
n
=
0
20
a
n
i
20
−
n
p(i)=∑ 
n=0
20
​
 a 
n
​
 i 
20−n
 , where 
a
n
=
(
−
1
)
n
(
n
+
1
)
2
a 
n
​
 =(−1) 
n
 (n+1) 
2
 , with 
n
=
0
n=0 to 
20
20, and 
a
20
=
441
a 
20
​
 =441.

wait, actually, from earlier, the general term is 
(
−
1
)
n
(
n
+
1
)
2
z
20
−
n
(−1) 
n
 (n+1) 
2
 z 
20−n
 , but to make it consistent with standard polynomial notation, perhaps it's better to write 
p
(
z
)
=
∑
k
=
0
20
a
k
z
k
p(z)=∑ 
k=0
20
​
 a 
k
​
 z 
k
 , where 
a
k
=
(
−
1
)
20
−
k
(
21
−
k
)
2
a 
k
​
 =(−1) 
20−k
 (21−k) 
2
 , but i'm getting confused.

wait, let's look back at the polynomial:

p
(
z
)
=
z
20
−
4
z
19
+
9
z
18
−
16
z
17
+
⋯
+
441
p(z)=z 
20
 −4z 
19
 +9z 
18
 −16z 
17
 +⋯+441
so, the coefficients are 
a
20
=
1
a 
20
​
 =1, 
a
19
=
−
4
a 
19
​
 =−4, 
a
18
=
9
a 
18
​
 =9, 
a
17
=
−
16
a 
17
​
 =−16, ..., 
a
0
=
441
a 
0
​
 =441.

alternatively, the general term is 
a
20
−
n
=
(
−
1
)
n
(
n
+
1
)
2
a 
20−n
​
 =(−1) 
n
 (n+1) 
2
 , where 
n
=
0
n=0 to 
20
20.

wait, let me check for 
n
=
0
n=0: 
a
20
=
(
−
1
)
0
(
1
)
2
=
1
a 
20
​
 =(−1) 
0
 (1) 
2
 =1, correct.

for 
n
=
1
n=1: 
a
19
=
(
−
1
)
1
(
2
)
2
=
−
4
a 
19
​
 =(−1) 
1
 (2) 
2
 =−4, correct.

for 
n
=
2
n=2: 
a
18
=
(
−
1
)
2
(
3
)
2
=
9
a 
18
​
 =(−1) 
2
 (3) 
2
 =9, correct.

so, in general, 
a
20
−
n
=
(
−
1
)
n
(
n
+
1
)
2
a 
20−n
​
 =(−1) 
n
 (n+1) 
2
 , for 
n
=
0
n=0 to 
20
20.

now, to compute 
p
(
i
)
p(i), we have:

p
(
i
)
=
∑
k
=
0
20
a
k
i
k
=
∑
n
=
0
20
(
−
1
)
n
(
n
+
1
)
2
i
20
−
n
p(i)= 
k=0
∑
20
​
 a 
k
​
 i 
k
 = 
n=0
∑
20
​
 (−1) 
n
 (n+1) 
2
 i 
20−n
 
wait, actually, since 
a
20
−
n
=
(
−
1
)
n
(
n
+
1
)
2
a 
20−n
​
 =(−1) 
n
 (n+1) 
2
 , then:

p
(
i
)
=
∑
n
=
0
20
a
20
−
n
i
n
=
∑
n
=
0
20
(
−
1
)
n
(
n
+
1
)
2
i
n
p(i)= 
n=0
∑
20
​
 a 
20−n
​
 i 
n
 = 
n=0
∑
20
​
 (−1) 
n
 (n+1) 
2
 i 
n
 
similarly, 
p
(
−
i
)
=
∑
n
=
0
20
(
−
1
)
n
(
n
+
1
)
2
(
−
i
)
n
p(−i)=∑ 
n=0
20
​
 (−1) 
n
 (n+1) 
2
 (−i) 
n
 .

this still seems complicated to compute directly, but perhaps there's a pattern or simplification.

let me consider that 
i
n
i 
n
  cycles every 4 terms: 
1
,
i
,
−
1
,
−
i
,
…
1,i,−1,−i,…, and similarly for 
(
−
i
)
n
(−i) 
n
 : 
1
,
−
i
,
−
1
,
i
,
…
1,−i,−1,i,….

so, perhaps i can group the terms in the sum based on the value of 
n
n modulo 4.

let me consider 
p
(
i
)
=
∑
n
=
0
20
(
−
1
)
n
(
n

2
i
n
p(i)=∑ 
n=0
20
​
 (−1) 
n
 (n+1)

 .

let's write out the terms for 
n
=

20
20, grouping them by 
n

let's compute the real parts first:

−

161

200
161−361=−200

−
200
+
441
=

−200+441=241

so, the real part is 241.

now, the imaginary parts:

−

=

i
−4i+16i=12i

12
i
−

−
60
i

i

−60i+144i=84i

84
i
−
196
i
=

112
i

−
112
i

144
i

−
180
i

400
i

220
i
−180i+400i=220i

so, the imaginary part is 
220
i
220i.

therefore, 
p

220
i
p(i)=241+220i.

similarly, let's compute

now, summing these up:

the real parts are the same as in

p(i), so the real part is again 241.

now, the imaginary parts:

180
i

i

220
i
180i−400i=−220i

so, the imaginary part is

−220i.

therefore, 
p

)
=

−
220

p(−i)=241−220i.

now, recall that

therefore,

now, i need to compute

this still looks complicated, but perhaps there's a way to simplify it.

first, note that

i
241

220
i

  can be simplified by multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:

so,

now, compute

therefore, \( \frac{241 - 220i}{241 + 220
