Reasoning: Alright, so I've got this problem here: "What is the sum of the prime numbers less than 10?" At first glance, it seems pretty straightforward, but I want to make sure I understand what's being asked and approach it correctly.

First off, I need to recall what prime numbers are. From what I remember, a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, and so on. Wait, but isn't 1 considered a prime number? I think I've heard conflicting things about that. Let me double-check that.

Okay, looking it up, 1 is not considered a prime number. The definition specifically says greater than 1, so 1 is excluded. Got it. So, starting from 2 upwards.

Now, I need to list out all the prime numbers less than 10. Let's see:

2: Yes, that's prime.

3: Also prime.

4: Hmm, 4 can be divided by 2, so not prime.

5: Prime.

6: Divisible by 2 and 3, not prime.

7: Prime.

8: Divisible by 2 and 4, not prime.

9: Divisible by 3, not prime.

So, the primes less than 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.

Now, I just need to add them up: 2 + 3 is 5, plus 5 is 10, plus 7 is 17. So, the sum should be 17.

Wait a minute, is there any chance I missed a prime number less than 10? Let me think again. Starting from 2:

2 is prime.

3 is prime.

4 is not.

5 is prime.

6 is not.

7 is prime.

8 is not.

9 is not.

10 is not, since it's equal to 10 and we're considering less than 10.

Okay, so no, I don't think I missed any. But to be thorough, maybe I should check each number one more time.

2: Only divisible by 1 and 2, so prime.

3: Only divisible by 1 and 3, so prime.

4: Divisible by 1, 2, and 4, so not prime.

5: Only divisible by 1 and 5, so prime.

6: Divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 6, not prime.

7: Only divisible by 1 and 7, so prime.

8: Divisible by 1, 2, 4, and 8, not prime.

9: Divisible by 1, 3, and 9, not prime.

10: Divisible by 1, 2, 5, and 10, not prime.

Alright, so the list is correct: 2, 3, 5, and 7.

Adding them up: 2 + 3 is 5, plus 5 is 10, plus 7 is indeed 17.

I think that's the answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look up a list of prime numbers to confirm that there are no other primes less than 10 that I might have overlooked.

Looking at a prime number chart, yes, the primes less than 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.

So, summing them: 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.

I don't see any reason to doubt this conclusion. It seems straightforward, but it's always good to double-check, especially when dealing with definitions and ensuring no numbers are missed or incorrectly included.
