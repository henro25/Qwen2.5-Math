Reasoning: 
So i have this problem here. it defines a new operation called "nabla" for positive numbers a and b, and it's given by the formula:

$$

a \nabla b = \frac{a + b}{1 + a b}

$$

and there's an example provided: 
3
∇
6
=
3
+
6
1
+
3
×
6
=
9
19
3∇6= 
1+3×6
3+6
​
 = 
19
9
​
 .

my task is to calculate 
(
1
∇
2
)
∇
3
(1∇2)∇3.

okay, so first, i need to understand what this nabla operation does. it takes two positive numbers, adds them together, and divides by 1 plus their product.

let me see, to compute 
(
1
∇
2
)
∇
3
(1∇2)∇3, i need to first compute 
1
∇
2
1∇2, and then take that result and nabla it with 3.

so, step one: compute 
1
∇
2
1∇2.

using the formula:

$$

1 \nabla 2 = \frac{1 + 2}{1 + 1 \times 2} = \frac{3}{1 + 2} = \frac{3}{3} = 1

$$

wait, so 
1
∇
2
=
1
1∇2=1.

now, i need to compute 
1
∇
3
1∇3, but actually, it's 
(
1
∇
2
)
∇
3
=
1
∇
3
(1∇2)∇3=1∇3.

so, next step: compute 
1
∇
3
1∇3.

again, using the formula:

$$

1 \nabla 3 = \frac{1 + 3}{1 + 1 \times 3} = \frac{4}{1 + 3} = \frac{4}{4} = 1

$$

so, 
(
1
∇
2
)
∇
3
=
1
∇
3
=
1
(1∇2)∇3=1∇3=1.

wait, that seems straightforward. but let me double-check if i did everything correctly.

first, i calculated 
1
∇
2
1∇2:

$$

1 \nabla 2 = \frac{1 + 2}{1 + 1 \times 2} = \frac{3}{3} = 1

$$

yes, that looks correct.

then, i took that result and did 
1
∇
3
1∇3:

$$

1 \nabla 3 = \frac{1 + 3}{1 + 1 \times 3} = \frac{4}{4} = 1

$$

again, that seems right.

hmm, but i feel like maybe there's something more to this operation. it seems like when i do 
a
∇
b
a∇b where a and b are both 1, or in this case, a is 1 and b is something else, it's simplifying nicely.

let me try another example to see if i understand the operation better.

suppose i have 
2
∇
3
2∇3:

$$

2 \nabla 3 = \frac{2 + 3}{1 + 2 \times 3} = \frac{5}{7}

$$

okay, that's 
5
7
7
5
​
 . another example: 
4
∇
5
4∇5:

$$

4 \nabla 5 = \frac{4 + 5}{1 + 4 \times 5} = \frac{9}{21} = \frac{3}{7}

$$

alright, so the operation is giving different results based on the inputs.

back to my original problem. is there a pattern here? it seems like when i take 
1
∇
b
1∇b, it's always 
1
1.

wait, let's test that.

compute 
1
∇
b
1∇b:

$$

1 \nabla b = \frac{1 + b}{1 + 1 \times b} = \frac{1 + b}{1 + b} = 1

$$

yes, indeed, 
1
∇
b
=
1
1∇b=1 for any positive b.

so, that explains why 
1
∇
2
=
1
1∇2=1 and 
1
∇
3
=
1
1∇3=1.

therefore, 
(
1
∇
2
)
∇
3
=
1
∇
3
=
1
(1∇2)∇3=1∇3=1.

wait, but is there a general property here? it seems like 1 is some sort of identity element for this operation.

in standard operations, like addition, 0 is the identity because 
a
+
0
=
a
a+0=a. for multiplication, 1 is the identity because 
a
×
1
=
a
a×1=a. here, it seems like 1 might be acting as an identity for this nabla operation.

let me check if that's generally true.

suppose i have 
a
∇
1
a∇1:

$$

a \nabla 1 = \frac{a + 1}{1 + a \times 1} = \frac{a + 1}{1 + a} = 1

$$

yes, so 
a
∇
1
=
1
a∇1=1 for any positive a.

similarly, 
1
∇
a
=
1
1∇a=1.

so, 1 is like a "zero" element for this operation, in a way, because it always gives 1 when combined with any other positive number.

interesting.

but back to the problem at hand. since 
1
∇
b
=
1
1∇b=1 for any positive b, then 
(
1
∇
2
)
∇
3
=
1
∇
3
=
1
(1∇2)∇3=1∇3=1.

is there another way to approach this problem? maybe to see if the operation is associative, or if there's some property that can make this calculation easier.

let me see if this operation is associative. that is, does 
(
a
∇
b
)
∇
c
=
a
∇
(
b
∇
c
)
(a∇b)∇c=a∇(b∇c)?

let me test with some numbers.

take a=1, b=2, c=3.

we have 
(
1
∇
2
)
∇
3
=
1
∇
3
=
1
(1∇2)∇3=1∇3=1.

now, 
1
∇
(
2
∇
3
)
1∇(2∇3).

first, compute 
2
∇
3
=
2
+
3
1
+
2
×
3
=
5
7
2∇3= 
1+2×3
2+3
​
 = 
7
5
​
 .

then, 
1
∇
5
7
=
1
+
5
7
1
+
1
×
5
7
=

1+ 
7
5
​
 
​
 = 
7
12
​
 
7
12
​
 
​
 =1.

so, in this case, both 
(
1
∇
2
)
∇
3
(1∇2)∇3 and 
1
∇
(
2
∇
3
)
1∇(2∇3) equal 1. so, they are equal.

does this hold in general? let's see.

assume associativity: 
(
a
∇
b
)
∇
c
=
a
∇
(
b
∇
c
)
(a∇b)∇c=a∇(b∇c).

let me compute both sides.

first, 
(
a

)
∇
c
(a∇b)∇c:

compute 
a
∇
b
=
a
+

 .

then,

simplify numerator and denominator.

simplify numerator and denominator.

​
 .

wait, that's the same as 
(
a
∇
b
)
∇
c
(a∇b)∇c.

therefore, the operation is associative.

that's interesting. so, 
(
a
∇
b
)
∇
c
=
a
∇
(
b
∇
c
)
(a∇b)∇c=a∇(b∇c).

therefore, in this problem, 
(
1
∇

)
∇
3
=
1
∇
(

)
=
1
∇
5
7
=
1
(1∇2)∇3=1∇(2∇3)=1∇ 
7
5
​
 =1, as we saw earlier.

alternatively, because the operation is associative, we can compute it in any grouping, and it should give the same result.

also, since 1 acts like an identity element here, it always returns 1 when nabla'd with any positive number.

so, no matter what, 
1
∇
b
=
1
1∇b=1, and thus, 
(
1
∇
2
)
∇
3
=
1
(1∇2)∇3=1.

but to be thorough, let's check another example to confirm the associativity.

let’s take a=2, b=3, c=4.

compute 
(
2
∇
3
)
∇
4
(2∇3)∇4.

first, 
2
∇

2∇3=

 =

​
 =

​
 .

now, compute 
2
∇
(

∇

)
2∇(3∇4).

first, 
3
∇

=

=

13
3∇4=

then,

​
 
​
 =

​
 =

​
 .

so, both ways give the same result, confirming associativity in this case.

therefore, the operation is associative, and 
(
1
∇
2
)
∇
3
=
1
(1∇2)∇3=1.

alternatively, perhaps there is a different approach to this problem, maybe recognizing this operation as something familiar.

looking at the definition:

$$

a \nabla b = \frac{a + b}{1 + a b}

$$

this looks similar to the formula for the addition of velocities in special relativity, or perhaps related to hyperbolic tangent addition formulas.

let me recall that in hyperbolic functions, the addition formula for hyperbolic tangents is:

$$

\tanh(a + b) = \frac{\tanh a + \tanh b}{1 + \tanh a \tanh b}

$$

comparing this to our operation:

$$

a \nabla b = \frac{a + b}{1 + a b}

$$

it looks very similar, except that in the hyperbolic tangent addition formula, a and b are hyperbolic tangents of angles, not just arbitrary positive numbers.

perhaps there's a connection here.

if i consider a and b as hyperbolic tangents of some variables, then the nabla operation corresponds to the hyperbolic tangent of the sum of those variables.

but i'm not sure if that helps in this particular problem, since the problem doesn't provide any information about hyperbolic functions or angles.

alternatively, in probability theory, there is something called the "odds ratio," but i don't think that's directly relevant here.

alternatively, in the context of continued fractions or other operations, but again, not directly helpful.

alternatively, perhaps considering this operation in terms of fractions or rational functions.

alternatively, maybe considering that this operation is similar to the addition formula for inverse hyperbolic functions or something like that.

but perhaps that's overcomplicating things for this problem.

alternatively, perhaps considering the operation in terms of continued fractions or other iterative processes.

but again, perhaps not necessary for this problem.

alternatively, perhaps considering the operation in terms of geometric series or something like that.

but perhaps that's also not necessary.

alternatively, perhaps considering the operation in terms of matrix multiplication or other algebraic structures.

but again, perhaps that's beyond the scope of this problem.

alternatively, perhaps thinking of this operation as a kind of weighted average or some other kind of mean.

but given the specific formula, it seems to be a specific operation with its own properties.

alternatively, perhaps considering the operation in terms of continued fractions or recursive sequences.

but perhaps that's not helpful here.

alternatively, perhaps considering the operation in terms of generating functions or other advanced mathematical tools.

but given that this is a problem likely intended for high school students, i think that's probably not necessary.

alternatively, perhaps considering the operation in terms of geometric interpretations, like in the unit circle or something like that.

but again, perhaps not directly helpful.

alternatively, perhaps considering properties like commutativity or associativity, which i have already partially explored.

we saw that the operation is associative, at least in the examples we've tried.

also, is it commutative?

let me check if 
a
∇
b
=
b
∇
a
a∇b=b∇a.

compute 
a
∇
b
=
a
+
b
1
+
a
b
a∇b= 
1+ab
a+b
​
 .

compute 
b
∇
a
=
b
+
a
1
+
b
a
=
a
+
b
1
+
a
b
b∇a= 
1+ba
b+a
​
 = 
1+ab
a+b
​
 .

yes, it's commutative.

therefore, the operation is both commutative and associative, based on these observations.

given that, perhaps there is an identity element, as we suspected earlier.

we saw that 
1
∇
b
=
1
1∇b=1, which suggests that 1 acts as a right identity.

similarly, 
a
∇
1
=
1
a∇1=1, so 1 is a two-sided identity.

alternatively, perhaps there is an inverse element for this operation.

in standard algebraic structures, like groups, we have inverses.

let me see if there is an inverse for a given a, such that 
a
∇
a
−
1
=
1
a∇a 
−1
 =1.

so, suppose 
a
∇
a
−
1
=
1
a∇a 
−1
 =1.

then,

$$

\frac{a + a^{-1}}{1 + a \times a^{-1}} = 1

$$

multiply both sides by the denominator:

$$

a + a^{-1} = 1 + a \times a^{-1}

$$

but 
a
×
a
−
1
=
1
a×a 
−1
 =1, assuming it's a multiplicative inverse.

wait, but in this operation, it's a different kind of inverse.

alternatively, perhaps i need to solve for 
a
−
1
a 
−1
  such that 
a
∇
a
−
1
=
1
a∇a 
−1
 =1.

so,

$$

\frac{a + a^{-1}}{1 + a a^{-1}} = 1

$$

multiply both sides by 
1
+
a
a
−
1
1+aa 
−1
 :

$$

a + a^{-1} = 1 + a a^{-1}

$$

rearrange:

$$

a + a^{-1} - a a^{-1} = 1

$$

this seems a bit messy. maybe i can solve for 
a
−
1
a 
−1
 :

let me denote 
b
=
a
−
1
b=a 
−1
 , then:

$$

a + b = 1 + a b

$$

so,

$$

a + b - a b = 1

$$

let me solve for b:

$$

b (1 - a) + a = 1 \\

b (1 - a) = 1 - a \\

b = \frac{1 - a}{1 - a} = 1

$$

wait, that's not helpful. it suggests 
b
=
1
b=1, which would mean 
a
−
1
=
1
a 
−1
 =1, but that doesn't make sense unless a = 1.

alternatively, perhaps there is no inverse for a general a, or perhaps the inverse is not defined in the usual sense.

alternatively, perhaps 1 is the only idempotent element, meaning 
a
∇
a
=
a
a∇a=a.

let me check:

$$

a \nabla a = \frac{a + a}{1 + a^2} = \frac{2a}{1 + a^2}

$$

for this to equal a, we'd need:

$$

\frac{2a}{1 + a^2} = a \\

2a = a (1 + a^2) \\

2a = a + a^3 \\

a^3 - a = 0 \\

a(a^2 - 1) = 0 \\

a = 0 \text{ or } a = 1 \text{ or } a = -1

$$

but since a > 0, only a = 1 is a solution.

therefore, only a = 1 is idempotent under this operation.

so, 1 is idempotent, and it's also the identity element for this operation.

therefore, in this algebraic structure, 1 plays a significant role.

given that, perhaps this operation is part of a group or a monoid, with 1 as the identity.

but perhaps i'm getting too deep into abstract algebra for this problem.

alternatively, perhaps thinking about inverses isn't necessary for solving the original problem.

so, going back to the original problem: calculate 
(
1
∇
2
)
∇
3
(1∇2)∇3.

we have already established that 
1
∇
b
=
1
1∇b=1 for any positive b, so 
1
∇
2
=
1
1∇2=1, and then 
1
∇
3
=
1
1∇3=1.

therefore, 
(
1
∇
2
)
∇
3
=
1
(1∇2)∇3=1.

alternatively, since the operation is associative, we could write 
1
∇
2
∇
3
1∇2∇3, and since 1 is the identity, the entire expression simplifies to 1.

therefore, the final answer is 1.

but just to be completely thorough, perhaps i can consider if there's any other possible interpretation or if i've missed any subtlety in the problem.

the problem states that a and b are positive, and provides the operation formula. it also gives an example with 3 and 6, which matches the formula.

i've double-checked my calculations, and they seem correct.

also, considering the properties of the operation, it seems consistent.

therefore, i'm confident that the answer is 1.
