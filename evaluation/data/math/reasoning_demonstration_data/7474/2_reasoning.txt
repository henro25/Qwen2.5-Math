Reasoning: Let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. we have a pyramid pabcd with a rectangular base abcd. the base has sides ab = 8 and bc = 4, so ad must also be 4 since it's a rectangle. we’re given that pa is perpendicular to both ad and ab, and pb = 17. we need to find the volume of this pyramid.

first, i recall that the volume of a pyramid is (1/3) times the area of the base times the height. so, v = (1/3) * base area * height.

the base is a rectangle with sides 8 and 4, so its area is 8 * 4 = 32.

now, i need to find the height of the pyramid. the height is the perpendicular distance from the apex p to the base abcd. since pa is perpendicular to both ab and ad, it seems like pa could be the height, but i'm not sure yet.

let me visualize this. if pa is perpendicular to both ab and ad, then pa is perpendicular to the plane of the base abcd. that makes sense because, in a pyramid, the apex is usually directly above one of the base vertices when the pyramid is right, meaning the apex is perpendicular above the base.

but is this pyramid a right pyramid? it seems like it might be because pa is perpendicular to the base, but i need to confirm.

let me consider coordinates to make this clearer. let's place the rectangle abcd on the coordinate plane.

let’s set point a at the origin, (0,0,0). since ab is 8 and ad is 4, let's place point b at (8,0,0), point d at (0,4,0), and point c at (8,4,0).

now, point p is somewhere above the base, and pa is perpendicular to both ab and ad. since ab is along the x-axis and ad is along the y-axis, pa being perpendicular to both suggests that pa is along the z-axis.

wait, if pa is along the z-axis, then p would be at (0,0,h), where h is the height of the pyramid.

given that pb = 17, i can use the distance formula to find h.

the coordinates of p are (0,0,h), and b is at (8,0,0). so, the distance pb is:

pb = sqrt( (8-0)^2 + (0-0)^2 + (0 - h)^2 ) = sqrt(64 + h^2) = 17.

so, sqrt(64 + h^2) = 17.

squaring both sides: 64 + h^2 = 289.

then, h^2 = 289 - 64 = 225.

so, h = sqrt(225) = 15.

therefore, the height of the pyramid is 15.

now, plugging back into the volume formula:

v = (1/3) * base area * height = (1/3) * 32 * 15.

let me calculate that: 32 * 15 = 480, and 480 / 3 = 160.

so, the volume should be 160.

wait, but let me double-check if pa is indeed the height.

given that pa is perpendicular to both ab and ad, and ab and ad are perpendicular to each other since abcd is a rectangle, then pa is perpendicular to the plane containing ab and ad, which is the base abcd. therefore, pa is indeed the height of the pyramid.

also, since pb = 17, and we've used that to find h = 15, which seems consistent.

alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this, perhaps using vectors or another geometric property, but i think the coordinate approach is straightforward and should be correct.

therefore, the volume of pyramid pabcd is 160.

**final answer**

160
