Reasoning: Let's tackle this problem step by step. we have segment 
s
1
s 
1
​	
  with endpoints at 
(
4
,
1
)
(4,1) and 
(
−
8
,
5
)
(−8,5), and we need to find the midpoint of segment 
s
2
s 
2
​	
 , which is obtained by translating 
s
1
s 
1
​	
  by 2 units to the right and 3 units up. finally, we need to express the midpoint as 
(
a
,
b
)
(a,b) where 
a
a and 
b
b are integers.

first, i need to understand what it means to translate a segment. translating a segment means moving it in the plane without rotating or changing its size or shape. so, if we translate each endpoint of 
s
1
s 
1
​	
  by the same amount, we'll get the corresponding endpoints of 
s
2
s 
2
​	
 .

the translation given is 2 units to the right and 3 units up. in coordinate terms, moving to the right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate. so, for any point 
(
x
,
y
)
(x,y), translating it 2 units right and 3 units up would result in 
(
x
+
2
,
y
+
3
)
(x+2,y+3).

let me apply this translation to both endpoints of 
s
1
s 
1
​	
 .

first endpoint of 
s
1
s 
1
​	
 : 
(
4
,
1
)
(4,1)

translated to: 
(
4
+
2
,
1
+
3
)
=
(
6
,
4
)
(4+2,1+3)=(6,4)

second endpoint of 
s
1
s 
1
​	
 : 
(
−
8
,
5
)
(−8,5)

translated to: 
(
−
8
+
2
,
5
+
3
)
=
(
−
6
,
8
)
(−8+2,5+3)=(−6,8)

so, the endpoints of 
s
2
s 
2
​	
  are 
(
6
,
4
)
(6,4) and 
(
−
6
,
8
)
(−6,8).

now, to find the midpoint of 
s
2
s 
2
​	
 , i can use the midpoint formula. the midpoint 
m
m of a segment with endpoints 
(
x
1
,
y
1
)
(x 
1
​	
 ,y 
1
​	
 ) and 
(
x
2
,
y
2
)
(x 
2
​	
 ,y 
2
​	
 ) is given by:

m
=
(
x
1
+
x
2
2
,
y
1
+
y
2
2
)
m=( 
2
x 
1
​	
 +x 
2
​	
 
​	
 , 
2
y 
1
​	
 +y 
2
​	
 
​	
 )
applying this formula to the endpoints of 
s
2
s 
2
​	
 :

m
=
(
6
+
(
−
6
)
2
,
4
+
8
2
)
=
(
0
2
,
12
2
)
=
(
0
,
6
)
m=( 
2
6+(−6)
​	
 , 
2
4+8
​	
 )=( 
2
0
​	
 , 
2
12
​	
 )=(0,6)
wait a minute, that seems straightforward. but let me double-check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by finding the midpoint of 
s
1
s 
1
​	
  first and then translating it.

the midpoint of 
s
1
s 
1
​	
  is:

m
1
=
(
4
+
(
−
8
)
2
,
1
+
5
2
)
=
(
−
4
2
,
6
2
)
=
(
−
2
,
3
)
m 
1
​	
 =( 
2
4+(−8)
​	
 , 
2
1+5
​	
 )=( 
2
−4
​	
 , 
2
6
​	
 )=(−2,3)
now, translating this midpoint by 2 units to the right and 3 units up:

m
2
=
(
−
2
+
2
,
3
+
3
)
=
(
0
,
6
)
m 
2
​	
 =(−2+2,3+3)=(0,6)
okay, i get the same result using this method. that's reassuring.

just to make sure i haven't missed anything, let's consider if there's a property of translations that could simplify this process further. translations are rigid transformations, meaning they preserve distances and angles, so the midpoint of the translated segment should indeed be the translation of the original midpoint. that aligns with what i did earlier.

additionally, since translations are linear transformations, applying them to the endpoints and then finding the midpoint should be equivalent to finding the midpoint first and then translating it. both approaches gave me 
(
0
,
6
)
(0,6), so i feel confident about this answer.

is there anything else i should consider? maybe checking if the translation was applied correctly to each endpoint.

original endpoints of 
s
1
s 
1
​	
 : 
(
4
,
1
)
(4,1) and 
(
−
8
,
5
)
(−8,5)

translated endpoints of 
s
2
s 
2
​	
 : 
(
6
,
4
)
(6,4) and 
(
−
6
,
8
)
(−6,8)

yes, adding 2 to the x-coordinates and 3 to the y-coordinates seems correct.

and the midpoint calculation:

(
6
+
(
−
6
)
2
,
4
+
8
2
)
=
(
0
,
6
)
( 
2
6+(−6)
​	
 , 
2
4+8
​	
 )=(0,6)
everything checks out.

so, the midpoint of segment 
s
2
s 
2
​	
  is 
(
0
,
6
)
(0,6).

**final answer**
