Answer: Given the quadratic equation \( x^2 + a x + b = 0 \) with solutions \( a \) and \( b \), we use vieta's formulas to find the values of \( a \) and \( b \).

1. the sum of the roots \( a + b \) should be equal to \( -a \):
   \[
   a + b = -a \implies 2a + b = 0 \implies b = -2a
   \]

2. the product of the roots \( a \cdot b \) should be equal to \( b \):
   \[
   a \cdot b = b \implies a \cdot (-2a) = -2a \implies -2a^2 = -2a \implies a^2 = a \implies a(a - 1) = 0
   \]
   since \( a \) and \( b \) are nonzero, \( a \neq 0 \), so \( a = 1 \).

3. substituting \( a = 1 \) into \( b = -2a \):
   \[
   b = -2(1) = -2
   \]

thus, the ordered pair \((a, b)\) is:
\[
\boxed{(1, -2)}
\]
