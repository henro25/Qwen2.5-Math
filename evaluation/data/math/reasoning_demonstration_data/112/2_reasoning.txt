Reasoning: Let's see. i've got this problem here: "suppose that 
a
a and 
b
b are nonzero real numbers, and that the equation 
x
2
+
a
x
+
b
=
0
x 
2
 +ax+b=0 has solutions 
a
a and 
b
b. find the ordered pair 
(
a
,
b
)
(a,b)."

okay, so i need to find values for 
a
a and 
b
b such that when i plug them into the quadratic equation 
x
2
+
a
x
+
b
=
0
x 
2
 +ax+b=0, the solutions to that equation are 
a
a and 
b
b themselves. that's a bit circular, but let's try to break it down.

first, i recall that for a quadratic equation of the form 
x
2
+
p
x
+
q
=
0
x 
2
 +px+q=0, the sum of the roots is 
−
p
−p and the product of the roots is 
q
q. this comes from vieta's formulas. so, in this case, the sum of the roots 
a
+
b
a+b should be equal to 
−
a
−a, and the product 
a
⋅
b
a⋅b should be equal to 
b
b.

let me write that down:

1. sum of roots: 
a
+
b
=
−
a
a+b=−a

2. product of roots: 
a
⋅
b
=
b
a⋅b=b

alright, let's work with these two equations.

starting with the first equation: 
a
+
b
=
−
a
a+b=−a.

if i add 
a
a to both sides, i get: 
2
a
+
b
=
0
2a+b=0.

so, 
b
=
−
2
a
b=−2a.

now, plugging this into the second equation: 
a
⋅
b
=
b
a⋅b=b.

substituting 
b
b with 
−
2
a
−2a, we have: 
a
⋅
(
−
2
a
)
=
−
2
a
a⋅(−2a)=−2a.

simplifying that: 
−
2
a
2
=
−
2
a
−2a 
2
 =−2a.

let's divide both sides by -2 to make it simpler: 
a
2
=
a
a 
2
 =a.

so, 
a
2
−
a
=
0
a 
2
 −a=0, which factors to 
a
(
a
−
1
)
=
0
a(a−1)=0.

therefore, 
a
=
0
a=0 or 
a
=
1
a=1.

but wait, the problem states that 
a
a and 
b
b are nonzero real numbers. so, 
a
=
0
a=0 is not allowed. hence, 
a
=
1
a=1.

now, since 
b
=
−
2
a
b=−2a, and 
a
=
1
a=1, then 
b
=
−
2
(
1
)
=
−
2
b=−2(1)=−2.

so, the ordered pair should be 
(
1
,
−
2
)
(1,−2).

let me check if this works in the original equation.

plugging 
a
=
1
a=1 and 
b
=
−
2
b=−2 into the equation 
x
2
+
a
x
+
b
=
0
x 
2
 +ax+b=0, we get:

x
2
+
1
x
−
2
=
0
x 
2
 +1x−2=0.

let's find the solutions to this equation.

using the quadratic formula: 
x
=
−
b
±
b
2
−
4
a
c
2
a
x= 
2a
−b± 
b 
2
 −4ac
​
 
​
 , where 
a
=
1
a=1, 
b
=
1
b=1, and 
c
=
−
2
c=−2:

x
=
−
1
±
1
2
−
4
(
1
)
(
−
2
)
2
(
1
)
=
−
1
±
1
+
8
2
=
−
1
±
9
2
=
−
1
±
3
2
x= 
2(1)
−1± 
1 
2
 −4(1)(−2)
​
 
​
 = 
2
−1± 
1+8
​
 
​
 = 
2
−1± 
9
​
 
​
 = 
2
−1±3
​
 .

so, the solutions are:

x
=
−
1
+
3
2
=
1
x= 
2
−1+3
​
 =1 and 
x
=
−
1
−
3
2
=
−
2
x= 
2
−1−3
​
 =−2.

perfect! the solutions are indeed 
a
=
1
a=1 and 
b
=
−
2
b=−2, which matches what we found earlier.

wait a minute, just to be thorough, is there any other possible pair 
(
a
,
b
)
(a,b) that could satisfy these conditions?

let's see. we had 
a
(
a
−
1
)
=
0
a(a−1)=0, leading to 
a
=
0
a=0 or 
a
=
1
a=1. but 
a
=
0
a=0 is invalid because 
a
a and 
b
b are nonzero. so, only 
a
=
1
a=1 is valid, leading to 
b
=
−
2
b=−2.

is there any other approach to solve this problem?

alternatively, since 
a
a and 
b
b are roots of the equation 
x
2
+
a
x
+
b
=
0
x 
2
 +ax+b=0, i can substitute 
x
=
a
x=a and 
x
=
b
x=b into the equation.

first, substituting 
x
=
a
x=a:

a
2
+
a
(
a
)
+
b
=
0
a 
2
 +a(a)+b=0 → 
a
2
+
a
2
+
b
=
0
a 
2
 +a 
2
 +b=0 → 
2
a
2
+
b
=
0
2a 
2
 +b=0.

second, substituting 
x
=
b
x=b:

b
2
+
a
(
b
)
+
b
=
0
b 
2
 +a(b)+b=0 → 
b
2
+
a
b
+
b
=
0
b 
2
 +ab+b=0.

now, from the first equation, 
b
=
−
2
a
2
b=−2a 
2
 .

plugging this into the second equation:

(
−
2
a
2
)
2
+
a
(
−
2
a
2
)
+
(
−
2
a
2
)
=
0
(−2a 
2
 ) 
2
 +a(−2a 
2
 )+(−2a 
2
 )=0 → 
4
a
4
−
2
a
3
−
2
a
2
=
0
4a 
4
 −2a 
3
 −2a 
2
 =0.

factor out 
2
a
2
2a 
2
 :

2
a
2
(
2
a
2
−
a
−
1
)
=
0
2a 
2
 (2a 
2
 −a−1)=0.

since 
a
≠
0
a

=0, 
2
a
2
−
a
−
1
=
0
2a 
2
 −a−1=0.

solving this quadratic equation for 
a
a:

a
=
1
±
1
+
8
4
=
1
±
3
4
a= 
4
1± 
1+8
​
 
​
 = 
4
1±3
​
 .

so, 
a
=
1
a=1 or 
a
=
−
1
2
a=− 
2
1
​
 .

wait, earlier i found 
a
=
1
a=1, but now i have another possible value, 
a
=
−
1
2
a=− 
2
1
​
 .

hmm, maybe i made a mistake earlier.

let me check with 
a
=
−
1
2
a=− 
2
1
​
 .

if 
a
=
−
1
2
a=− 
2
1
​
 , then from 
b
=
−
2
a
2
b=−2a 
2
 , we have 
b
=
−
2
(
1
4
)
=
−
1
2
b=−2( 
4
1
​
 )=− 
2
1
​
 .

so, the ordered pair would be 
(
−
1
2
,
−
1
2
)
(− 
2
1
​
 ,− 
2
1
​
 ).

let's check if this satisfies the original equation.

plugging into 
x
2
+
a
x
+
b
=
0
x 
2
 +ax+b=0, we get:

x
2
−
1
2
x
−
1
2
=
0
x 
2
 − 
2
1
​
 x− 
2
1
​
 =0.

finding the roots:

x
=
1
2
±
(
1
2
)
2
+
2
2
=
1
2
±
1
4
+
2
2
=
1
2
±
9
4
2
=
1
2
±
3
2
2
x= 
2
2
1
​
 ± 
( 
2
1
​
 ) 
2
 +2
​
 
​
 = 
2
2
1
​
 ± 
4
1
​
 +2
​
 
​
 = 
2
2
1
​
 ± 
4
9
​
 
​
 
​
 = 
2
2
1
​
 ± 
2
3
​
 
​
 .

so, 
x
=
1
/
2
+
3
/
2
2
=
1
x= 
2
1/2+3/2
​
 =1 and 
x
=
1
/
2
−
3
/
2
2
=
−
1
2
x= 
2
1/2−3/2
​
 =− 
2
1
​
 .

but wait, the roots are 
1
1 and 
−
1
2
− 
2
1
​
 , but according to the problem, the roots should be 
a
a and 
b
b, which are both 
−
1
2
− 
2
1
​
  in this case. there's a mismatch here.

so, if 
a
=
−
1
2
a=− 
2
1
​
  and 
b
=
−
1
2
b=− 
2
1
​
 , then the equation should have roots 
a
a and 
b
b, both equal to 
−
1
2
− 
2
1
​
 , meaning it should be a repeated root.

but in the equation 
x
2
−
1
2
x
−
1
2
=
0
x 
2
 − 
2
1
​
 x− 
2
1
​
 =0, the roots are 
1
1 and 
−
1
2
− 
2
1
​
 , not both 
−
1
2
− 
2
1
​
 .

so, there's an inconsistency here. that suggests that 
a
=
−
1
2
a=− 
2
1
​
  is not a valid solution.

wait, maybe i made a mistake in assuming that both roots are 
a
a and 
b
b, and if 
a
=
b
a=b, then it should be a repeated root.

let me check again.

if 
a
=
b
=
−
1
2
a=b=− 
2
1
​
 , then the quadratic equation should be 
x
2
+
a
x
+
b
=
x
2
−
1
2
x
−
1
2
=
0
x 
2
 +ax+b=x 
2
 − 
2
1
​
 x− 
2
1
​
 =0, and its roots should both be 
−
1
2
− 
2
1
​
 .

but as we saw, the roots are 
1
1 and 
−
1
2
− 
2
1
​
 , not both 
−
1
2
− 
2
1
​
 .

therefore, 
a
=
−
1
2
a=− 
2
1
​
  does not satisfy the condition that both roots are 
a
a and 
b
b.

so, the only valid solution is 
a
=
1
a=1 and 
b
=
−
2
b=−2.

alternatively, perhaps there's another approach to confirm this.

let me consider that if 
a
a and 
b
b are roots of the equation 
x
2
+
a
x
+
b
=
0
x 
2
 +ax+b=0, then substituting 
x
=
a
x=a and 
x
=
b
x=b into the equation must satisfy it.

so, for 
x
=
a
x=a:

a
2
+
a
⋅
a
+
b
=
0
a 
2
 +a⋅a+b=0 → 
2
a
2
+
b
=
0
2a 
2
 +b=0.

for 
x
=
b
x=b:

b
2
+
a
⋅
b
+
b
=
0
b 
2
 +a⋅b+b=0.

now, from the first equation, 
b
=
−
2
a
2
b=−2a 
2
 .

plugging this into the second equation:

b
2
+
a
b
+
b
=
(
−
2
a
2
)
2
+
a
(
−
2
a
2
)
+
(
−
2
a
2
)
=
4
a
4
−
2
a
3
−
2
a
2
=
0
b 
2
 +ab+b=(−2a 
2
 ) 
2
 +a(−2a 
2
 )+(−2a 
2
 )=4a 
4
 −2a 
3
 −2a 
2
 =0.

factor out 
2
a
2
2a 
2
 :

2
a
2
(
2
a
2
−
a
−
1
)
=
0
2a 
2
 (2a 
2
 −a−1)=0.

since 
a
≠
0
a

=0, 
2
a
2
−
a
−
1
=
0
2a 
2
 −a−1=0.

solving this quadratic equation:

a
=
1
±
1
+
8
4
=
1
±
3
4
a= 
4
1± 
1+8
​
 
​
 = 
4
1±3
​
 , so 
a
=
1
a=1 or 
a
=
−
1
2
a=− 
2
1
​
 .

as before, 
a
=
1
a=1 leads to 
b
=
−
2
b=−2, which works, and 
a
=
−
1
2
a=− 
2
1
​
  leads to 
b
=
−
1
2
b=− 
2
1
​
 , which doesn't satisfy the original equation having both roots as 
a
a and 
b
b.

therefore, the only solution is 
(
a
,
b
)
=
(
1
,
−
2
)
(a,b)=(1,−2).

just to be extra sure, let's consider if there could be any other pairs 
(
a
,
b
)
(a,b) that satisfy the conditions.

suppose that 
a
a and 
b
b are both equal to some value 
k
k, so 
a
=
b
=
k
a=b=k.

then, the quadratic equation would be 
x
2
+
k
x
+
k
=
0
x 
2
 +kx+k=0, and both roots would be 
k
k.

for a quadratic equation to have both roots equal, the discriminant must be zero.

the discriminant is 
k
2
−
4
k
k 
2
 −4k.

setting this to zero: 
k
2
−
4
k
=
0
k 
2
 −4k=0 → 
k
(
k
−
4
)
=
0
k(k−4)=0.

so, 
k
=
0
k=0 or 
k
=
4
k=4.

but 
k
=
a
=
b
k=a=b cannot be zero, as per the problem statement, so 
k
=
4
k=4.

so, 
a
=
b
=
4
a=b=4.

let's check this.

plugging into the equation: 
x
2
+
4
x
+
4
=
0
x 
2
 +4x+4=0.

the roots are 
x
=
−
4
±
16
−
16
2
=
−
4
±
0
2
=
−
2
x= 
2
−4± 
16−16
​
 
​
 = 
2
−4±0
​
 =−2.

so, both roots are 
−
2
−2, but 
a
=
b
=
4
a=b=4, which doesn't match the roots.

therefore, this doesn't satisfy the condition that the roots are 
a
a and 
b
b.

hence, there are no solutions where 
a
=
b
a=b, except for the invalid 
a
=
b
=
0
a=b=0.

thus, the only valid solution is 
(
a
,
b
)
=
(
1
,
−
2
)
(a,b)=(1,−2).

**final answer**
