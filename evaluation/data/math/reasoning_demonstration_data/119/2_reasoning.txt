Reasoning: Let's try to solve this problem step by step. so, we have vectors oa, ob, and oc with given magnitudes and some angles between them. we need to express oc as a linear combination of oa and ob, meaning we need to find scalars m and n such that oc = m*oa + n*ob.

first, let's write down what we know:

- ||oa|| = 1

- ||ob|| = 1

- ||oc|| = √2

- tan(angle aoc) = 7

- angle boc = 45 degrees

and we have the asymptote code which probably shows the positions of points a, b, and c relative to o, but since i can't see the diagram, i'll rely on the given information.

let's assume o is the origin, and oa is along the positive x-axis for simplicity. so, oa = (1, 0).

now, ob has a magnitude of 1, but its direction isn't specified directly. however, since angle boc is 45 degrees, and angle aoc has a tangent of 7, maybe we can find the coordinates of c using these angles.

wait, angle aoc is the angle between oa and oc. given that oa is along the x-axis, angle aoc would be the angle that oc makes with the x-axis.

given that tan(angle aoc) = 7, we can find the components of oc.

let’s denote angle aoc as θ. so, tanθ = 7, which means that the slope of oc is 7. since oc has a magnitude of √2, we can find its coordinates.

let’s recall that if a vector has magnitude r and makes an angle θ with the x-axis, its coordinates are (r*cosθ, r*sinθ).

we have tanθ = 7, so θ = arctan(7).

we can express cosθ and sinθ in terms of tanθ.

we know that:

tanθ = sinθ / cosθ = 7

also, sin^2θ + cos^2θ = 1

let’s set cosθ = x, then sinθ = 7x

so, x^2 + (7x)^2 = 1 => x^2 + 49x^2 = 1 => 50x^2 = 1 => x^2 = 1/50 => x = 1/√50 = √2/10

therefore, cosθ = √2/10 and sinθ = 7√2/10

hence, oc = (√2 * cosθ, √2 * sinθ) = (√2 * √2/10, √2 * 7√2/10) = (2/10, 14/10) = (1/5, 7/5)

wait, that doesn't seem right because ||oc|| should be √2, but let's check the magnitude of (1/5, 7/5):

||oc|| = √[(1/5)^2 + (7/5)^2] = √[(1 + 49)/25] = √[50/25] = √2, which matches.

okay, so oc = (1/5, 7/5)

now, we need to express oc as m*oa + n*ob.

we have oa = (1, 0), and ob is given to have magnitude 1, but we need its components.

we know angle boc = 45 degrees. since oc is at angle θ = arctan(7), and boc is 45 degrees, then angle between ob and oc is 45 degrees.

wait, angle boc is the angle between ob and oc, which is 45 degrees.

we need to find the coordinates of ob.

let’s denote ob as (a, b), with ||ob|| = 1, so a^2 + b^2 = 1.

we know that the angle between ob and oc is 45 degrees.

the formula for the angle between two vectors u and v is:

cos(angle) = (u ⋅ v) / (||u|| ||v||)

here, angle is 45 degrees, u = ob, v = oc.

so, cos(45°) = (ob ⋅ oc) / (||ob|| ||oc||)

we have ||ob|| = 1, ||oc|| = √2, so:

cos(45°) = (a*(1/5) + b*(7/5)) / (√2)

we know cos(45°) = √2/2, so:

√2/2 = (a/5 + 7b/5) / √2

multiply both sides by √2:

(√2)(√2)/2 = a/5 + 7b/5

2/2 = a/5 + 7b/5

1 = (a + 7b)/5

so, a + 7b = 5

now, we also have that a^2 + b^2 = 1

so, we have the system:

a + 7b = 5

a^2 + b^2 = 1

let’s solve this system.

from the first equation, a = 5 - 7b

plug into the second equation:

(5 - 7b)^2 + b^2 = 1

25 - 70b + 49b^2 + b^2 = 1

25 - 70b + 50b^2 = 1

50b^2 - 70b + 24 = 0

divide the entire equation by 2:

25b^2 - 35b + 12 = 0

now, let's solve for b using quadratic formula:

b = [35 ± √(35^2 - 4*25*12)] / (2*25)

calculate discriminant:

35^2 = 1225

4*25*12 = 1200

so, √(1225 - 1200) = √25 = 5

thus, b = [35 ± 5]/50

so, b = (35 + 5)/50 = 40/50 = 4/5

or b = (35 - 5)/50 = 30/50 = 3/5

now, find corresponding a:

if b = 4/5, then a = 5 - 7*(4/5) = 5 - 28/5 = 25/5 - 28/5 = -3/5

if b = 3/5, then a = 5 - 7*(3/5) = 5 - 21/5 = 25/5 - 21/5 = 4/5

so, ob could be either (-3/5, 4/5) or (4/5, 3/5)

now, let's see which one makes sense.

looking back at the asymptote code, it seems that b is in the second quadrant since it's labeled nw, meaning it's likely (-0.6, 0.8), which is (-3/5, 4/5)

so, ob = (-3/5, 4/5)

now, we have oa = (1, 0), ob = (-3/5, 4/5), and oc = (1/5, 7/5)

we need to find m and n such that:

oc = m*oa + n*ob

so,

(1/5, 7/5) = m*(1, 0) + n*(-3/5, 4/5)

this gives us two equations:

1/5 = m - (3/5)n

7/5 = 0*m + (4/5)n

so,

1/5 = m - (3/5)n

7/5 = (4/5)n

first, solve the second equation for n:

7/5 = (4/5)n

multiply both sides by 5:

7 = 4n

so, n = 7/4

now, plug n into the first equation:

1/5 = m - (3/5)*(7/4)

calculate (3/5)*(7/4) = 21/20

so,

1/5 = m - 21/20

add 21/20 to both sides:

m = 1/5 + 21/20 = 4/20 + 21/20 = 25/20 = 5/4

therefore, m = 5/4 and n = 7/4

so, the ordered pair is (5/4, 7/4)

let me just double-check:

oc = (1/5, 7/5)

m*oa + n*ob = (5/4)*1 + (7/4)*(-3/5) = 5/4 - 21/20 = (25/20 - 21/20) = 4/20 = 1/5 for the x-component

and for y-component: (5/4)*0 + (7/4)*(4/5) = 0 + 28/20 = 7/5

which matches oc, so it's correct.
