Answer: To find all possible values of \( f(0) \) for the function \( f(x) \) that satisfies the equation \( f(x + y) = f(x) f(y) \) for all real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), we can proceed as follows:

1. set \( y = 0 \) in the given equation:
   \[
   f(x + 0) = f(x) f(0)
   \]
   since \( x + 0 = x \), this simplifies to:
   \[
   f(x) = f(x) f(0)
   \]
   rearranging, we get:
   \[
   f(x) (1 - f(0)) = 0
   \]
   this must hold for all \( x \). therefore, either \( f(x) = 0 \) for all \( x \), or \( 1 - f(0) = 0 \), which implies \( f(0) = 1 \).

2. consider the case \( f(x) = 0 \) for all \( x \):
   \[
   f(0) = 0
   \]

3. consider the case \( f(0) = 1 \):
   this is satisfied by functions of the form \( f(x) = e^{kx} \) for some constant \( k \), which includes the exponential function.

thus, the possible values of \( f(0) \) are \( 0 \) and \( 1 \).

\[
\boxed{0, 1}
\]
