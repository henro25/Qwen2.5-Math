Answer: Given points \( a = (0,0) \) and \( b = (b,2) \), we need to find the area of a convex equilateral hexagon \( abcdef \) with the given conditions. the y-coordinates of the vertices are distinct elements of the set \(\{0,2,4,6,8,10\}\).

1. **side length calculation**:
   the side length of the hexagon is \( \sqrt{b^2 + 4} \).

2. **parallel conditions and vector analysis**:
   - \( \overline{ab} \parallel \overline{de} \)
   - \( \overline{bc} \parallel \overline{ef} \)
   - \( \overline{cd} \parallel \overline{fa} \)

3. **area calculation**:
   assuming the hexagon is regular (since it is equilateral and convex with equal internal angles of 120Â°), the area of a regular hexagon with side length \( s \) is given by:
   \[
   \text{area} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2
   \]
   here, \( s = \sqrt{b^2 + 4} \).

4. **determining \( b \)**:
   given the y-coordinates are distinct and increase by 2 units, we assume the hexagon is regular and use the distance between parallel sides:
   \[
   s\sqrt{3} = 4 \implies s = \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}}
   \]
   thus,
   \[
   \sqrt{b^2 + 4} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}} \implies b^2 + 4 = \frac{16}{3} \implies b^2 = \frac{4}{3} \implies b = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}
   \]

5. **final area calculation**:
   substituting \( s = \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}} \) into the area formula:
   \[
   \text{area} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \left( \frac{16}{3} \right) = 8\sqrt{3}
   \]

thus, the area of the hexagon is \( 8\sqrt{3} \), and \( m + n = 8 + 3 = 11 \).

\[
\boxed{11}
\]
