Reasoning: Let's dive into this problem. it's quite involved, but i'll take it step by step.

we have points a at (0,0) and b at (b,2), and we're dealing with a convex equilateral hexagon abcdef. that means all sides are equal in length, and all interior angles are equal, but since it's convex, none of the sides cross each other.

first, let's note the given information:

1. a = (0,0)

2. b = (b,2)

3. the hexagon is equilateral, so all sides are equal.

4. ∠fab = 120°

5. ab is parallel to de

6. bc is parallel to ef

7. cd is parallel to fa

8. the y-coordinates of the vertices are distinct elements of {0,2,4,6,8,10}.

we need to find the area of this hexagon, expressed in the form m√n, and then find m + n.

alright, first things first: since the hexagon is equilateral, all sides have the same length. let's find the length of ab.

ab is from (0,0) to (b,2), so its length is sqrt[(b)^2 + (2)^2] = sqrt(b² + 4).

since all sides are equal, bc = cd = de = ef = fa = sqrt(b² + 4).

next, we have angles: ∠fab = 120°. since it's a convex equilateral hexagon, i believe all internal angles are equal. for a regular hexagon, each internal angle is 120°, but this is not necessarily regular since only the sides are equal, not the angles. however, given that ∠fab is 120°, and the hexagon is convex and equilateral, i think all internal angles might be 120°, but i need to confirm that.

wait, no. in a convex equilateral hexagon, the internal angles can vary, but the sum of internal angles for any hexagon is (6-2)*180° = 720°. if all angles are equal, each would be 120°, but here only one angle is specified as 120°, ∠fab.

but given the parallel conditions, maybe there's more structure here.

let's look at the parallel conditions:

- ab || de

- bc || ef

- cd || fa

this suggests that the hexagon has some sort of symmetry or pattern in its side directions.

also, the y-coordinates of the vertices are distinct elements from {0,2,4,6,8,10}. since a is at y=0 and b is at y=2, the remaining vertices c, d, e, f must have y-coordinates from {4,6,8,10}, each distinct.

let me try to sketch this out or at least visualize it.

first, plot points a(0,0) and b(b,2). then, we need to find points c, d, e, f such that the hexagon is equilateral with the given parallel conditions and y-coordinates from the specified set.

given that ab || de, and ab has a slope of (2-0)/(b-0) = 2/b, so de must also have a slope of 2/b.

similarly, bc || ef, so their slopes must be equal.

and cd || fa, so their slopes are equal.

this suggests that the directions of these sides are consistent.

since all sides are equal in length and we have these parallel conditions, perhaps the hexagon is composed of two congruent trapezoids or something similar.

alternatively, maybe it's better to consider vectors or complex numbers to represent the positions of the points.

let me try using vectors.

let’s denote vectors for each side.

let’s denote vector ab as b - a = (b,2).

since all sides are equal, each side vector has the same magnitude, which is sqrt(b² + 4).

now, since ∠fab = 120°, and fa is one side, ab is another side, and the angle between them is 120°.

in vector terms, the angle between vectors fa and ab is 120°.

wait, fa is from f to a, and ab is from a to b.

let’s define all vectors in the direction of the sides:

fa = a - f

ab = b - a

given that, the angle between fa and ab is 120°.

alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the angles between consecutive sides.

in a polygon, the turn between consecutive sides is related to the internal angle.

but this might get complicated.

let me consider the coordinates of the points.

we have a(0,0), b(b,2), and need to find c, d, e, f with y-coordinates 4,6,8,10.

let me list the possible y-coordinates for each point:

- a: 0

- b: 2

- c: 4,6,8,10

- d: from the remaining

- e: from the remaining

- f: from the remaining

but since y-coordinates are distinct, each point gets a unique y-coordinate from the set.

given the parallel conditions, perhaps we can find relationships between the coordinates.

let me consider ab || de.

since ab has slope 2/b, de must also have slope 2/b.

similarly, bc || ef, so slope of bc = slope of ef.

cd || fa, so slope of cd = slope of fa.

given that, perhaps we can express the coordinates of the points in terms of b.

alternatively, maybe it's better to fix b and find the positions of the other points.

but i don't know b yet. maybe i can find b first.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that the hexagon is composed of two triangles or other polygons whose areas i can calculate and sum up.

but that seems complicated.

let me consider that since all sides are equal and the angles are 120°, perhaps the hexagon can be divided into equilateral triangles or something similar.

wait, but the hexagon is equilateral, not necessarily equiangular.

given that, maybe i can use the fact that in a convex equilateral hexagon with angles specified, certain properties hold.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the vectors representing the sides and ensure that their sum is zero, as it's a closed polygon.

let’s denote the vectors of the sides as vectors ab, bc, cd, de, ef, fa.

since it's a closed polygon, the sum of these vectors is zero.

so, ab + bc + cd + de + ef + fa = 0.

given that, and knowing that ab, bc, cd, de, ef, fa all have the same magnitude, and certain angles between them, perhaps i can express them in terms of their components and solve for b.

but that seems involved.

alternatively, perhaps i can use complex numbers to represent the points.

let me try that.

let’s place point a at the origin, 0 + 0i.

point b is at b + 2i.

now, since ab || de, and de has the same slope as ab, which corresponds to the same direction in the complex plane.

similarly, bc || ef, and cd || fa.

this suggests that de is a translation of ab by some vector, and similarly for the other pairs.

but i'm not sure if that's the right approach.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that since ab || de, the vector de is equal to ab multiplied by some rotation.

wait, in the complex plane, rotating a vector by an angle θ is equivalent to multiplying by e^{iθ}.

given that, perhaps i can express the vectors in terms of rotations.

but this is getting too abstract for now.

let me try to find the coordinates step by step.

we have a(0,0) and b(b,2).

we need to find c, d, e, f with y-coordinates from {4,6,8,10}, each distinct.

let me assume an order for the points: a, b, c, d, e, f, back to a.

given that, and the parallel conditions:

- ab || de

- bc || ef

- cd || fa

let me try to find the coordinates of c.

first, ab has slope 2/b.

since bc is connected to b and is part of the hexagon, and bc || ef.

but perhaps it's better to look for relationships between the sides.

given that all sides are equal in length, and ab has length sqrt(b² + 4), all other sides must also have that length.

let me try to find point c.

from b(b,2), moving to c, which has a y-coordinate of either 4,6,8, or 10.

let me suppose that c has y-coordinate 4.

then, the vertical change from b to c is 4 - 2 = 2.

since the side length is sqrt(b² + 4), the horizontal change should satisfy sqrt(b² + 4) = sqrt(delta_x² + delta_y²).

here, delta_y is 2 (from 2 to 4), so delta_x² + 2² = b² + 4.

thus, delta_x² + 4 = b² + 4 => delta_x² = b² => delta_x = ±b.

so, c could be at (b + b, 4) = (2b,4) or (b - b,4) = (0,4).

but (0,4) is directly above a(0,0), which might not make sense given the parallel conditions.

similarly, (2b,4) is another option.

but i need to consider the angle at b.

wait, maybe i need to consider the angle between ab and bc.

in a convex equilateral hexagon with ∠fab = 120°, what can i say about the angles at other vertices?

alternatively, perhaps i can use vectors to represent the sides.

let me denote vectors:

let’s define vector ab as (b,2).

since the hexagon is equilateral, all side vectors have the same magnitude, sqrt(b² + 4).

let’s denote vector bc as (x1, y1), with magnitude sqrt(x1² + y1²) = sqrt(b² + 4).

similarly for the other sides.

given that, and the parallel conditions, perhaps i can set up equations to solve for the coordinates.

but this seems quite involved.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that in a convex equilateral hexagon with these parallel conditions, the hexagon can be divided into parallelograms or other shapes with known area formulas.

but i'm not sure.

maybe i can look for symmetry in the y-coordinates.

the y-coordinates are distinct elements from {0,2,4,6,8,10}, with a at 0 and b at 2.

so, the remaining y-coordinates are 4,6,8,10 for c,d,e,f.

perhaps there's a pattern in how these y-coordinates increase or decrease around the hexagon.

let me consider that in a convex hexagon, the y-coordinates should alternately increase and decrease, or follow some order that maintains convexity.

alternatively, maybe the hexagon is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, but since a is at (0,0), and b is at (b,2), unless b=0, which can't be because then ab would be vertical, but b can't be zero because then ab would have zero length in x-direction, which might not make sense.

wait, but b could be zero. let's see: if b=0, then a and b are both on the y-axis at (0,0) and (0,2). then, the hexagon would have vertical sides, which might not satisfy the parallel conditions.

so, probably b ≠ 0.

given that, perhaps it's better to assign coordinates to the points based on the y-values.

let me list the possible y-coordinates for each point:

a: 0

b: 2

c: 4,6,8,10

d: from remaining y-coordinates

e: from remaining y-coordinates

f: from remaining y-coordinates

assuming convexity, the points should be ordered in such a way that the polygon doesn't intersect itself.

let me try to assign y-coordinates in increasing order: a(0,0), b(b,2), c(some x,4), d(some x,6), e(some x,8), f(some x,10).

but i need to ensure that the hexagon is convex and that the sides are equal in length and the parallel conditions are satisfied.

alternatively, maybe the y-coordinates alternate in some fashion.

this is getting too vague. maybe i should look for a different approach.

let me consider that since ab || de, and ab has length sqrt(b² + 4), de must also have that length and the same direction.

similarly, bc || ef, so ef has the same length and direction as bc.

and cd || fa, so fa has the same length and direction as cd.

given that, perhaps i can express de, ef, and fa in terms of ab, bc, and cd.

wait, de is parallel to ab, so de is a translation of ab by some vector.

similarly for the other pairs.

this suggests that the hexagon can be constructed by translating certain sides.

but perhaps it's better to consider the vectors forming the sides.

let me denote the vectors:

let’s define vector ab as (b,2).

vector bc as (c_x, c_y - 2), where c is (c_x, c_y).

similarly, vector cd as (d_x - c_x, d_y - c_y), and so on.

but this seems too general.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that since all sides are equal in length, the differences in y-coordinates correspond to certain horizontal shifts.

wait, in going from a(0,0) to b(b,2), the y-coordinate increases by 2, and x-coordinate increases by b.

then, from b to c, if the side length is the same, and y-coordinate increases or decreases by a certain amount, the x-coordinate changes accordingly.

but this seems similar to what i did earlier.

let me try to set up equations based on side lengths.

let’s suppose c has coordinates (c_x,4).

then, the vector bc is (c_x - b, 4 - 2) = (c_x - b, 2).

the length of bc should be equal to ab, which is sqrt(b² + 4).

therefore, sqrt((c_x - b)^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(b² + 4).

squaring both sides: (c_x - b)^2 + 4 = b^2 + 4.

therefore, (c_x - b)^2 = b^2.

so, c_x - b = ±b.

thus, c_x = b ± b.

so, c_x = 2b or c_x = 0.

so, possible coordinates for c are (2b,4) or (0,4).

now, considering convexity, let's see which one makes sense.

if c is at (0,4), then from a(0,0) to b(b,2) to c(0,4), the polygon would have a "dent" if b is positive, which might violate convexity.

similarly, if c is at (2b,4), it might be more consistent with convexity.

so, perhaps c is at (2b,4).

similarly, let's find d.

from c(2b,4) to d(d_x,6), the vector cd is (d_x - 2b, 6 - 4) = (d_x - 2b, 2).

the length should be sqrt(b^2 + 4).

therefore, sqrt((d_x - 2b)^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(b^2 + 4).

squaring both sides: (d_x - 2b)^2 + 4 = b^2 + 4.

therefore, (d_x - 2b)^2 = b^2.

thus, d_x - 2b = ±b.

so, d_x = 2b ± b, which is d_x = 3b or d_x = b.

thus, d is at (3b,6) or (b,6).

again, considering convexity, perhaps d is at (3b,6).

proceeding similarly, let's find e.

from d(3b,6) to e(e_x,8), vector de is (e_x - 3b, 8 - 6) = (e_x - 3b, 2).

since de is parallel to ab, which is (b,2), de should be a scalar multiple of ab.

but since de has the same direction as ab, their components should be proportional.

so, (e_x - 3b)/b = 2/2 = 1.

thus, e_x - 3b = b => e_x = 4b.

so, e is at (4b,8).

similarly, from e(4b,8) to f(f_x,10), vector ef is (f_x - 4b, 10 - 8) = (f_x - 4b, 2).

given that bc || ef, and bc is (2b - b,4 - 2) = (b,2), so ef should be proportional to bc.

wait, bc is from b(b,2) to c(2b,4), which is (b,2), same as ab.

wait, bc is (2b - b,4 - 2) = (b,2), same as ab.

similarly, ef should be parallel to bc, which is (b,2).

therefore, ef should be proportional to (b,2).

given that ef is (f_x - 4b, 2), and it should be proportional to (b,2), which implies that (f_x - 4b)/b = 2/2 = 1.

thus, f_x - 4b = b => f_x = 5b.

so, f is at (5b,10).

finally, from f(5b,10) back to a(0,0), vector fa is (0 - 5b, 0 - 10) = (-5b, -10).

given that cd is parallel to fa, and cd is from c(2b,4) to d(3b,6), which is (b,2).

wait, earlier i thought d is at (3b,6), but cd should be parallel to fa, which is (-5b,-10).

but cd is (b,2), which should be parallel to fa (-5b,-10).

are these vectors parallel?

let's check if (-5b,-10) is a scalar multiple of (b,2).

indeed, (-5b,-10) = -5*(b,2), so yes, they are parallel.

good.

now, let's check if all sides have the same length.

ab: sqrt(b^2 + 4)

bc: from b(b,2) to c(2b,4): sqrt(b^2 + 4)

cd: from c(2b,4) to d(3b,6): sqrt(b^2 + 4)

de: from d(3b,6) to e(4b,8): sqrt(b^2 + 4)

ef: from e(4b,8) to f(5b,10): sqrt(b^2 + 4)

fa: from f(5b,10) to a(0,0): sqrt(25b^2 + 100) = sqrt(25(b^2 + 4)) = 5*sqrt(b^2 + 4)

wait a minute, fa is supposed to be equal in length to the other sides, which are sqrt(b^2 + 4), but here fa is 5*sqrt(b^2 + 4), which is much larger.

this can't be, because all sides are supposed to be equal.

this suggests that my assumption about the coordinates might be wrong.

wait, perhaps i made a mistake in assuming the coordinates of d, e, f.

let me go back.

i had:

- a(0,0)

- b(b,2)

- c(2b,4)

- d(3b,6)

- e(4b,8)

- f(5b,10)

but then fa is from f(5b,10) to a(0,0), which is indeed (-5b,-10), with length 5*sqrt(b^2 + 4), which is not equal to sqrt(b^2 + 4).

this is a problem.

so, perhaps my assumption that c is at (2b,4) is incorrect.

let me try the other option for c, which is (0,4).

so, c(0,4).

then, from c(0,4) to d(d_x,6), vector cd is (d_x - 0, 6 - 4) = (d_x, 2).

this should have length sqrt(b^2 + 4).

therefore, sqrt(d_x^2 + 4) = sqrt(b^2 + 4).

thus, d_x^2 + 4 = b^2 + 4 => d_x^2 = b^2 => d_x = ±b.

so, d is at (b,6) or (-b,6).

let's consider d(b,6).

then, from d(b,6) to e(e_x,8), vector de is (e_x - b, 8 - 6) = (e_x - b, 2).

since de is parallel to ab, which is (b,2), the direction should be the same.

therefore, (e_x - b)/b = 2/2 = 1 => e_x - b = b => e_x = 2b.

so, e is at (2b,8).

then, from e(2b,8) to f(f_x,10), vector ef is (f_x - 2b, 10 - 8) = (f_x - 2b, 2).

given that bc is from b(b,2) to c(0,4), which is (-b,2), and ef is parallel to bc, which is (-b,2), then ef should be proportional to (-b,2).

therefore, (f_x - 2b)/(-b) = 2/2 = 1 => f_x - 2b = -b => f_x = b.

so, f is at (b,10).

finally, from f(b,10) back to a(0,0), vector fa is (-b, -10).

now, cd is from c(0,4) to d(b,6), which is (b,2).

fa is (-b,-10).

are these vectors parallel?

for cd to be parallel to fa, their components should be proportional.

so, (b)/(-b) = 2/(-10) => -1 = -1/5, which is not true.

therefore, they are not parallel.

this is a problem, since the condition is that cd is parallel to fa.

so, this suggests that d cannot be at (b,6).

let me try d(-b,6).

then, from d(-b,6) to e(e_x,8), vector de is (e_x - (-b), 8 - 6) = (e_x + b, 2).

since de is parallel to ab, which is (b,2), we have (e_x + b)/b = 2/2 = 1 => e_x + b = b => e_x = 0.

thus, e is at (0,8).

then, from e(0,8) to f(f_x,10), vector ef is (f_x - 0, 10 - 8) = (f_x, 2).

given that bc is from b(b,2) to c(0,4), which is (-b,2), and ef is parallel to bc, which is (-b,2), then ef should be proportional to (-b,2).

therefore, f_x / (-b) = 2/2 = 1 => f_x = -b.

so, f is at (-b,10).

now, from f(-b,10) back to a(0,0), vector fa is (b, -10).

now, cd is from c(0,4) to d(-b,6), which is (-b,2).

fa is (b,-10).

are these vectors parallel?

check if (-b)/b = 2/(-10) => -1 = -1/5, which is not true.

again, not parallel.

hmm.

this is frustrating.

it seems that neither choice for c leads to cd being parallel to fa.

maybe i need to reconsider my approach.

let me try to find a different way to assign coordinates.

alternatively, perhaps the hexagon is not aligned in the way i thought.

let me consider that the hexagon might not have all sides horizontal or vertical, but instead at certain angles.

given that ∠fab = 120°, perhaps i can use this to find the direction of fa.

let me consider vectors again.

let’s denote vector fa as vector from f to a: a - f.

vector ab is from a to b: b - a = (b,2).

given that, and ∠fab = 120°, the angle between vectors fa and ab is 120°.

the formula for the angle between two vectors u and v is:

cosθ = (u ⋅ v) / (|u| |v|)

so, cos(120°) = (fa ⋅ ab) / (|fa| |ab|)

we know cos(120°) = -1/2.

so, -1/2 = (fa ⋅ ab) / (|fa| |ab|)

but |fa| = |ab|, since all sides are equal.

therefore, -1/2 = (fa ⋅ ab) / (|ab|^2)

thus, fa ⋅ ab = -|ab|^2 / 2.

let’s compute fa ⋅ ab.

fa = a - f = (0 - f_x, 0 - f_y) = (-f_x, -f_y)

ab = (b,2)

so, fa ⋅ ab = (-f_x)(b) + (-f_y)(2) = -b f_x - 2 f_y

set this equal to -|ab|^2 / 2.

we have |ab|^2 = b^2 + 4.

thus, -b f_x - 2 f_y = -(b^2 + 4)/2

multiply both sides by -1:

b f_x + 2 f_y = (b^2 + 4)/2

this gives us an equation involving f_x and f_y.

but f has y-coordinate 10, so f_y = 10.

therefore:

b f_x + 2*10 = (b^2 + 4)/2

simplify:

b f_x + 20 = (b^2 + 4)/2

multiply both sides by 2:

2b f_x + 40 = b^2 + 4

rearrange:

2b f_x = b^2 + 4 - 40 => 2b f_x = b^2 - 36

thus, f_x = (b^2 - 36)/(2b)

now, f is at (f_x, 10) = ((b^2 - 36)/(2b), 10)

similarly, perhaps i can find coordinates for other points in terms of b.

this is getting quite involved, but maybe i can proceed this way.

let me try to find coordinates for all points in terms of b.

we have:

a(0,0)

b(b,2)

c needs to be determined.

from earlier attempts, it's tricky to assign coordinates directly.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the fact that the hexagon is equilateral and convex, and find the area using properties of equilateral polygons.

but i'm not sure about that.

alternatively, perhaps i can divide the hexagon into triangles and find their areas.

let me consider dividing the hexagon into four triangles: a-b-c, c-d-e, e-f-a, and maybe some others.

but i need to ensure that these triangles don't overlap and cover the entire hexagon.

alternatively, perhaps i can divide it into two trapezoids or other shapes.

this seems too vague.

let me consider another approach.

given that all sides are equal and the angles are 120°, perhaps the hexagon can be inscribed in a circle or something similar.

but since it's equilateral but not necessarily regular, this might not hold.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the fact that in a convex equilateral hexagon, the sum of every pair of opposite sides is equal.

but i don't know if that's the case here.

wait, in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are equal, but here it's only equilateral, not necessarily regular.

so, maybe that doesn't hold.

let me think differently.

suppose i consider the hexagon as composed of two congruent triangles and some parallelograms.

but that seems too vague.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the fact that the y-coordinates are distinct elements from {0,2,4,6,8,10}, and try to find a pattern in their arrangement.

given that, and the parallel conditions, maybe there's a way to determine b.

let me look back at the possible coordinates i've considered.

earlier, when c was at (2b,4), d at (3b,6), e at (4b,8), f at (5b,10), but fa ended up being much longer than the other sides.

alternatively, when c was at (0,4), d at (b,6) or (-b,6), but that led to inconsistencies in the parallel conditions.

perhaps there's a different way to arrange the y-coordinates.

let me consider that the y-coordinates increase by 2 units each time.

a(0,0), b(b,2), c(?,4), d(?,6), e(?,8), f(?,10).

alternatively, maybe they increase by different amounts.

wait, but the y-coordinates are distinct elements from {0,2,4,6,8,10}, so they must be in increasing or some order.

given that, and trying to satisfy the parallel conditions, maybe the hexagon has a specific orientation.

alternatively, perhaps i should consider that the hexagon is symmetric about a certain axis.

given that a is at (0,0) and b is at (b,2), maybe there's a vertical or horizontal axis of symmetry.

but i don't know for sure.

this is getting too complicated. maybe i should look for another way.

let me consider that since ab || de and bc || ef and cd || fa, perhaps the hexagon has translational symmetry or something similar.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the vectors and set up equations based on the parallel conditions.

let me try that.

let’s denote vector ab = (b,2)

vector de should be equal to ab, since they are parallel and have the same length.

therefore, de = ab = (b,2)

similarly, bc is parallel to ef, so ef = bc

and cd is parallel to fa, so fa = cd

given that, and knowing that the sum of the vectors around the hexagon is zero, we have:

ab + bc + cd + de + ef + fa = 0

substituting the equalities:

ab + bc + cd + ab + bc + cd = 0

wait, that seems off.

wait, de = ab, ef = bc, fa = cd.

therefore:

ab + bc + cd + ab + bc + cd = 0

so, 2ab + 2bc + 2cd = 0

divide both sides by 2:

ab + bc + cd = 0

so, ab + bc + cd = 0

but ab + bc = ac, and ac + cd = ad

thus, ad = 0, which implies a = d, which can't be since it's a hexagon.

this suggests that my assumption that de = ab, ef = bc, and fa = cd might be incorrect.

wait, perhaps de is equal in direction and magnitude to ab, but not necessarily equal as vectors.

maybe de is equal to ab shifted by some translation.

alternatively, perhaps de is a translation of ab, but not necessarily the same vector.

this is confusing.

let me try a different approach.

perhaps i can consider that since ab || de, the change in y-coordinates from a to b is the same as from d to e.

similarly, the change in x-coordinates from a to b is the same as from d to e.

given that, and knowing the y-coordinates, maybe i can find the x-coordinates.

for example, from a(0,0) to b(b,2), the change is (b,2).

therefore, from d to e, the change should also be (b,2).

given that, and knowing the y-coordinates of d and e, i can find their x-coordinates.

similarly, for the other parallel pairs.

let’s proceed with this.

given ab || de, with ab change (b,2), de should have the same change.

therefore, if d has coordinates (d_x, d_y), then e should be at (d_x + b, d_y + 2).

similarly, bc || ef, so the change from b to c is equal to the change from e to f.

let’s denote b(b,2) to c(c_x, c_y), so the change is (c_x - b, c_y - 2).

therefore, the change from e to f is the same: (f_x - e_x, f_y - e_y) = (c_x - b, c_y - 2).

similarly, cd || fa, so the change from c to d is equal to the change from f to a.

change from c to d: (d_x - c_x, d_y - c_y)

change from f to a: (0 - f_x, 0 - f_y) = (-f_x, -f_y)

therefore, (d_x - c_x, d_y - c_y) = (-f_x, -f_y)

so, d_x - c_x = -f_x and d_y - c_y = -f_y.

now, let's summarize what we have:

1. e = d + (b,2)

2. f = e + (c_x - b, c_y - 2)

3. d = c + (some change based on fa)

this seems too circular.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the y-coordinates to find the positions.

given that, and knowing that the y-coordinates are distinct elements from {0,2,4,6,8,10}, and a is at 0, b at 2, let's assign the remaining y-coordinates to c, d, e, f.

let me try assigning:

a: 0

b: 2

c: 4

d: 6

e: 8

f: 10

now, from a(0,0) to b(b,2), then to c(c_x,4), d(d_x,6), e(e_x,8), f(f_x,10), back to a.

now, given that ab || de, and ab has change (b,2), de should have the same change.

therefore, e = d + (b,2)

so, e_x = d_x + b and e_y = d_y + 2.

given that e_y = 8 and d_y = 6, this holds.

similarly, bc || ef.

change from b to c: (c_x - b, 4 - 2) = (c_x - b, 2)

therefore, change from e to f: (f_x - e_x, 10 - 8) = (f_x - e_x, 2)

thus, f_x - e_x = c_x - b

but e_x = d_x + b, so f_x - (d_x + b) = c_x - b => f_x = d_x + b + c_x - b = c_x + d_x

similarly, cd || fa.

change from c to d: (d_x - c_x, 6 - 4) = (d_x - c_x, 2)

change from f to a: (0 - f_x, 0 - 10) = (-f_x, -10)

therefore, (d_x - c_x, 2) = (-f_x, -10)

so, d_x - c_x = -f_x and 2 = -10, which is impossible.

this suggests a contradiction, meaning my assignments are incorrect.

alternatively, perhaps i made a mistake in assuming the changes.

wait, cd || fa, but not necessarily equal.

they are parallel, so their direction vectors are scalar multiples.

therefore, (d_x - c_x, 2) = k*(-f_x, -10), for some scalar k.

therefore, d_x - c_x = -k f_x and 2 = -10 k.

thus, k = -2/10 = -1/5.

therefore, d_x - c_x = -(-1/5)f_x = (1/5)f_x.

so, d_x - c_x = (1/5)f_x.

similarly, from earlier, f_x = c_x + d_x.

wait, from bc || ef, we had f_x = c_x + d_x.

now, substituting into d_x - c_x = (1/5)(c_x + d_x):

d_x - c_x = (1/5)c_x + (1/5)d_x

multiply both sides by 5:

5d_x - 5c_x = c_x + d_x

bring all terms to one side:

5d_x - 5c_x - c_x - d_x = 0 => 4d_x - 6c_x = 0 => 2d_x - 3c_x = 0 => d_x = (3/2)c_x

now, from de, e_x = d_x + b and e_y = 6 + 2 = 8, which matches our earlier assignment.

similarly, f_x = c_x + d_x = c_x + (3/2)c_x = (5/2)c_x

now, from fa, we have fa = (-f_x, -10)

from cd, which is (d_x - c_x, 2) = ((3/2)c_x - c_x, 2) = (c_x/2, 2)

from earlier, cd is parallel to fa, which is (-f_x, -10) = (-(5/2)c_x, -10)

so, (c_x/2, 2) should be parallel to (-(5/2)c_x, -10)

therefore, (c_x/2)/(-(5/2)c_x) = 2/(-10)

simplify left side: (c_x/2)/(-(5/2)c_x) = (c_x/2) * (2/(-5 c_x)) = 1/(-5) = -1/5

right side: 2/(-10) = -1/5

so, the directions are consistent.

now, let's find the side length.

ab = sqrt(b^2 + 4)

similarly, fa should be equal to this.

fa is from f((5/2)c_x,10) to a(0,0): sqrt((5/2 c_x)^2 + 10^2) = sqrt(25/4 c_x^2 + 100)

set this equal to sqrt(b^2 + 4):

sqrt(25/4 c_x^2 + 100) = sqrt(b^2 + 4)

square both sides:

25/4 c_x^2 + 100 = b^2 + 4

multiply both sides by 4:

25 c_x^2 + 400 = 4b^2 + 16

rearrange:

25 c_x^2 - 4b^2 = -384

this seems messy. maybe i need to express c_x in terms of b.

from earlier, d_x = (3/2)c_x, and f_x = (5/2)c_x.

now, from ab || de, de has change (b,2), and e is at (d_x + b,8).

similarly, from b(b,2) to c(c_x,4), the change is (c_x - b,2).

from e(e_x,8) to f(f_x,10), the change is (f_x - e_x,2) = ((5/2)c_x - (3/2)c_x + b, 2) = (c_x + b,2)

wait, e_x = d_x + b = (3/2)c_x + b

f_x = (5/2)c_x

so, f_x - e_x = (5/2)c_x - (3/2)c_x - b = (2/2)c_x - b = c_x - b

so, the change from e to f is (c_x - b, 2), which should be equal to the change from b to c, which is (c_x - b,2). that checks out.

now, from c(c_x,4) to d(d_x,6), the change is (d_x - c_x,2) = ((3/2)c_x - c_x,2) = (c_x/2,2)

from f(f_x,10) to a(0,0), the change is (-f_x,-10) = (-(5/2)c_x,-10)

these should be parallel, which they are, as established earlier.

now, going back to the equation:

25 c_x^2 - 4b^2 = -384

let me solve for b in terms of c_x.

25 c_x^2 + 384 = 4b^2

thus, b^2 = (25 c_x^2 + 384)/4

this seems complicated. maybe i can find a relationship between c_x and b.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that the y-coordinates must be distinct integers from {0,2,4,6,8,10}, and try to find integer values for c_x and b that satisfy the equation.

but c_x might not be an integer, though b could be.

alternatively, maybe there's a better way to approach this.

let me consider the area of the hexagon.

since it's equilateral with sides of length sqrt(b^2 + 4), and assuming all internal angles are 120°, perhaps i can use the formula for the area of a regular hexagon, but adjusted for equilateral rather than regular.

however, in a regular hexagon, all angles are 120°, and sides are equal, so perhaps this hexagon is regular.

wait, but in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel, which matches some of the conditions here.

given that, perhaps this hexagon is regular.

but in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal, and all angles are 120°, and opposite sides are parallel.

given that, and our conditions, it seems possible that this hexagon is regular.

if that's the case, then maybe the parallel conditions are already satisfied, and i can use the regular hexagon area formula.

the area of a regular hexagon with side length s is (3√3 / 2) s^2.

given that, if this hexagon is regular, then its area would be (3√3 / 2) * (sqrt(b^2 + 4))^2 = (3√3 / 2) * (b^2 + 4).

but i need to confirm if this hexagon is indeed regular.

given the conditions, it's possible, but i'm not entirely sure.

alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed with calculating the area using coordinates.

given that, and having expressions for all coordinates in terms of c_x and b, maybe i can use the shoelace formula to find the area in terms of these variables and then solve for the variables.

let me try that.

the shoelace formula for a polygon with vertices (x1,y1), (x2,y2), ..., (xn,yn) is:

area = 1/2 |sum_{i=1 to n} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|, where x_{n+1}=x1, y_{n+1}=y1.

given that, let's list the coordinates:

a(0,0)

b(b,2)

c(c_x,4)

d(d_x,6) = ((3/2)c_x,6)

e(e_x,8) = (d_x + b,8) = ((3/2)c_x + b,8)

f(f_x,10) = (c_x + d_x,10) = (c_x + (3/2)c_x,10) = ((5/2)c_x,10)

now, applying the shoelace formula:

area = 1/2 |(0*2 + b*4 + c_x*6 + (3/2 c_x)*8 + ((3/2 c_x) + b)*10 + (5/2 c_x)*0) - (0*b + 2*c_x + 4*(3/2 c_x) + 6*((3/2 c_x) + b) + 8*(5/2 c_x) + 10*0)|

let me compute each part step by step.

first, compute the sum of x_i y_{i+1}:

0*2 = 0

b*4 = 4b

c_x*6 = 6 c_x

(3/2 c_x)*8 = 12 c_x

((3/2 c_x) + b)*10 = 15 c_x + 10 b

(5/2 c_x)*0 = 0

total sum: 0 + 4b + 6 c_x + 12 c_x + 15 c_x + 10 b + 0 = (4b + 10b) + (6 c_x + 12 c_x + 15 c_x) = 14b + 33 c_x

now, compute the sum of y_i x_{i+1}:

0*b = 0

2*c_x = 2 c_x

4*(3/2 c_x) = 6 c_x

6*((3/2 c_x) + b) = 9 c_x + 6 b

8*(5/2 c_x) = 20 c_x

10*0 = 0

total sum: 0 + 2 c_x + 6 c_x + 9 c_x + 6 b + 20 c_x + 0 = (2 c_x + 6 c_x + 9 c_x + 20 c_x) + 6 b = 37 c_x + 6 b

now, area = 1/2 |(14b + 33 c_x) - (37 c_x + 6 b)| = 1/2 |14b + 33 c_x - 37 c_x - 6 b| = 1/2 |8b - 4 c_x| = 1/2 * |4(2b - c_x)| = 2 |2b - c_x|

since area is positive, we can drop the absolute value:

area = 2 |2b - c_x|

but from earlier, we have b^2 = (25 c_x^2 + 384)/4

let me solve for c_x in terms of b.

from 25 c_x^2 - 4b^2 = -384

rearranged: 25 c_x^2 = 4b^2 - 384

thus, c_x^2 = (4b^2 - 384)/25

now, since area = 2 |2b - c_x|, and i need to express area in terms of b or c_x, but it's getting too complicated.

perhaps there's a different approach.

let me consider that in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are equal and parallel, which seems to match the given conditions here.

if that's the case, then perhaps this hexagon is regular, and i can use the regular hexagon area formula.

given that, area = (3√3 / 2) s^2, where s is the side length.

here, s = sqrt(b^2 + 4), so area = (3√3 / 2)(b^2 + 4)

but i need to confirm if the hexagon is indeed regular.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the fact that in a regular hexagon, the distance between opposite sides is s√3, where s is the side length.

given that, and knowing the y-coordinates, perhaps i can relate this to the vertical distances in the hexagon.

the y-coordinates are 0,2,4,6,8,10, which are evenly spaced by 2 units.

in a regular hexagon, the vertical distance between parallel sides should be s√3.

given that, and the y-coordinates increase by 2 units each time, perhaps s√3 = 4, since from y=0 to y=4 is 4 units.

wait, no.

actually, from y=0 to y=4 is 4 units, but in a regular hexagon, the distance between parallel sides is s√3.

so, s√3 = 4 => s = 4/√3

but here, s = sqrt(b^2 + 4), so sqrt(b^2 + 4) = 4/√3

therefore, b^2 + 4 = 16/3 => b^2 = 16/3 - 12/3 = 4/3 => b = 2/√3

now, the area would be (3√3 / 2) * s^2 = (3√3 / 2) * (16/3) = (3√3 / 2) * (16/3) = (16√3)/2 = 8√3

but the problem states that the area is m√n, where n is square-free, so m=8 and n=3, thus m+n=11.

but i'm not sure if assuming the hexagon is regular is correct.

alternatively, perhaps the hexagon is not regular, and this approach is invalid.

given the time i've spent on this, i'll go with m+n=11.
