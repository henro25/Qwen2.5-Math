Reasoning: Let's tackle this problem step by step. we have points a, b, c, and d in 3d space, and we need to find a point p such that the distances from p to each of these points are equal. in other words, ap = bp = cp = dp.

first, let's write down the coordinates of the points:

- a = (8, 0, 0)

- b = (0, -4, 0)

- c = (0, 0, 6)

- d = (0, 0, 0)

we need to find p = (x, y, z) such that the distances from p to each of these points are equal.

let's start by setting up the distance equations. the distance between two points in 3d space is given by the formula:

distance
=
(
x
2
−
x
1
)
2
+
(
y
2
−
y
1
)
2
+
(
z
2
−
z
1
)
2
distance= 
(x 
2
​
 −x 
1
​
 ) 
2
 +(y 
2
​
 −y 
1
​
 ) 
2
 +(z 
2
​
 −z 
1
​
 ) 
2
 
​
 
so, the distances we need are:

1. ap: distance from p to a

a
p
=
(
x
−
8
)
2
+
(
y
−
0
)
2
+
(
z
−
0
)
2
=
(
x
−
8
)
2
+
y
2
+
z
2
ap= 
(x−8) 
2
 +(y−0) 
2
 +(z−0) 
2
 
​
 = 
(x−8) 
2
 +y 
2
 +z 
2
 
​
 
2. bp: distance from p to b

b
p
=
(
x
−
0
)
2
+
(
y
−
(
−
4
)
)
2
+
(
z
−
0
)
2
=
x
2
+
(
y
+

)
2
+
z
2
bp= 
(x−0) 
2
 +(y−(−4)) 
2
 +(z−0) 
2
 
​
 = 
x 
2
 +(y+4) 
2
 +z 
2
 
​
 
3. cp: distance from p to c

c
p
=
(
x
−
0
)
2
+
(
y
−
0
)
2
+
(
z
−
6
)
2
=
x
2
+
y
2
+
(
z
−
6
)
2
cp= 
(x−0) 
2
 +(y−0) 
2
 +(z−6) 
2
 
​
 = 
x 
2
 +y 
2
 +(z−6) 
2
 
​
 
4. dp: distance from p to d

d
p
=
(
x
−
0
)
2
+
(
y
−
0
)
2
+
(
z
−
0
)
2
=
x
2
+
y
2
+
z
2
dp= 
(x−0) 
2
 +(y−0) 
2
 +(z−0) 
2
 
​
 = 
x 
2
 +y 
2
 +z 
2
 
​
 
since ap = bp = cp = dp, we can set these distances equal to each other.

let's first set ap equal to dp:

(
x
−
8
)
2
+
y
2
+
z
2
=
x
2
+
y
2
+
z
2
(x−8) 
2
 +y 
2
 +z 
2
 
​
 = 
x 
2
 +y 
2
 +z 
2
 
​
 
to eliminate the square roots, we'll square both sides:

(
x
−
8
)
2
+
y
2
+
z
2
=
x
2
+
y
2
+
z
2
(x−8) 
2
 +y 
2
 +z 
2
 =x 
2
 +y 
2
 +z 
2
 
simplifying:

(
x
−
8
)
2
=
x
2
(x−8) 
2
 =x 
2
 
x
2
−
16
x
+
64
=
x
2
x 
2
 −16x+64=x 
2
 
−
16
x
+
64
=
0
−16x+64=0
−
16
x
=
−
64
−16x=−64
x
=
4
x=4
so, x-coordinate of p is 4.

next, let's set bp equal to dp:

x
2
+
(
y
+
4
)
2
+
z
2
=
x
2
+
y
2
+
z
2
x 
2
 +(y+4) 
2
 +z 
2
 
​
 = 
x 
2
 +y 
2
 +z 
2
 
​
 
again, square both sides:

x
2
+
(
y
+
4
)
2
+
z
2
=
x
2
+
y
2
+
z
2
x 
2
 +(y+4) 
2
 +z 
2
 =x 
2
 +y 
2
 +z 
2
 
simplify:

(
y
+
4
)
2
=
y
2
(y+4) 
2
 =y 
2
 
y
2
+
8
y
+
16
=
y
2
y 
2
 +8y+16=y 
2
 
8
y
+
16
=
0
8y+16=0
8
y
=
−
16
8y=−16
y
=
−
2
y=−2
so, y-coordinate of p is -2.

now, set cp equal to dp:

x
2
+
y
2
+
(
z
−
6
)
2
=
x
2
+
y
2
+
z
2
x 
2
 +y 
2
 +(z−6) 
2
 
​
 = 
x 
2
 +y 
2
 +z 
2
 
​
 
square both sides:

x
2
+
y
2
+
(
z
−
6
)
2
=
x
2
+
y
2
+
z
2
x 
2
 +y 
2
 +(z−6) 
2
 =x 
2
 +y 
2
 +z 
2
 
simplify:

(
z
−
6
)
2
=
z
2
(z−6) 
2
 =z 
2
 
z
2
−
12
z
+
36
=
z
2
z 
2
 −12z+36=z 
2
 
−
12
z
+
36
=
0
−12z+36=0
−
12
z
=
−
36
−12z=−36
z
=
3
z=3
so, z-coordinate of p is 3.

therefore, the point p is (4, -2, 3).

wait a minute, but we have four points and we set ap=dp, bp=dp, cp=dp, and we found p=(4,-2,3). we should verify if this point indeed satisfies ap=bp=cp=dp.

let's calculate each distance:

all distances are indeed equal to √29, so p=(4,-2,3) is the correct point.

but wait, i recall that in geometry, the point equidistant from four non-coplanar points is unique, and it's called the circumcenter in 3d space.

alternatively, we can think of this point p as the center of the sphere passing through points a, b, c, and d.

to confirm, we can set up the general equation of a sphere:

(
x
−
h
)
2
+
(
y
−
k
)
2
+
(
z
−
l
)
2
=
r
2
(x−h) 
2
 +(y−k) 
2
 +(z−l) 
2
 =r 
2
 
where (h, k, l) is the center, and r is the radius.

since points a, b, c, and d lie on this sphere, their coordinates must satisfy the equation.

so, plug in each point:

1. for a=(8,0,0):

(
8
−
h
)
2
+
(
0
−
k
)
2
+
(

2. for b=(0,-4,0):

(

h
)
2
+
(
−

)
2
+
(

)
2
=

2

2

2
 +(6−l) 
2
 =r 
2
 
4. for d=(0,0,0):

(

2

(

2

(

now, we can set up equations by equating these expressions since they all equal r².

first, set equation from a equal to equation from d:

(

2

2
+

−

−16h+64=0
h
=

h=4
next, set equation from b equal to equation from d:

h

(

)
2
+
l
2
=
h
2

16+8k=0
8
k
=
−
16

k
=
−

k=−2
then, set equation from c equal to equation from d:

h
2
+

2
+
(

−

)
2
=
h
2
+

(

2

l

l
2

2
36−12l+l 
2
 =l 
2
 
−
12
l
+
36
=
0
−12l+36=0
12
l
=
36
12l=36
l
=
3
l=3
so, the center of the sphere is at (4, -2, 3), which matches our earlier result for p.

therefore, the point p that is equidistant from points a, b, c, and d is indeed (4, -2, 3).

i think this is the correct answer, but just to be thorough, let's check if there could be any other points satisfying this condition.

given that four non-coplanar points define a unique sphere, there should be only one such point p that is equidistant to all four points. since we've found p=(4,-2,3), and verified that it satisfies all the distance conditions, there should be no other points that satisfy ap=bp=cp=dp.

so, i'm confident that p=(4,-2,3) is the correct answer.

**final answer**

(4, −2, 3)
