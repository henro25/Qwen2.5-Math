Reasoning: So i have this problem here: i'm supposed to find all possible values of the expression 
a
∣
a
∣
+
b
∣
b
∣
+
c
∣
c
∣
+
a
b
c
∣
a
b
c
∣
∣a∣
a
​	
 + 
∣b∣
b
​	
 + 
∣c∣
c
​	
 + 
∣abc∣
abc
​	
 , where 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c are nonzero real numbers. okay, let's try to break this down.

first, i know that for any nonzero real number 
x
x, 
x
∣
x
∣
∣x∣
x
​	
  is either 1 or -1, depending on whether 
x
x is positive or negative. so, 
a
∣
a
∣
∣a∣
a
​	
 , 
b
∣
b
∣
∣b∣
b
​	
 , and 
c
∣
c
∣
∣c∣
c
​	
  each can be either 1 or -1.

also, 
a
b
c
abc is just the product of 
a
a, 
b
b, and 
c
c, and since none of them are zero, 
a
b
c
abc is also nonzero. so, 
a
b
c
∣
a
b
c
∣
∣abc∣
abc
​	
  is also either 1 or -1, just like the others.

so, the expression is the sum of four terms, each of which is either 1 or -1. that means the possible values of the entire expression should be some integer between -4 and 4, in steps of 2, because each term contributes either +1 or -1.

but wait, is that always the case? let me think carefully. if all four terms are 1, the sum is 4; if three are 1 and one is -1, the sum is 2; if two are 1 and two are -1, the sum is 0; if one is 1 and three are -1, the sum is -2; and if all four are -1, the sum is -4.

however, i need to consider the relationship between these terms, especially since 
a
b
c
∣
a
b
c
∣
∣abc∣
abc
​	
  is related to 
a
∣
a
∣
∣a∣
a
​	
 , 
b
∣
b
∣
∣b∣
b
​	
 , and 
c
∣
c
∣
∣c∣
c
​	
 . specifically, 
a
b
c
∣
a
b
c
∣
=
a
∣
a
∣
⋅
b
∣
b
∣
⋅
c
∣
c
∣
∣abc∣
abc
​	
 = 
∣a∣
a
​	
 ⋅ 
∣b∣
b
​	
 ⋅ 
∣c∣
c
​	
 , because the absolute value of a product is the product of the absolute values.

so, if i let 
x
=
a
∣
a
∣
x= 
∣a∣
a
​	
 , 
y
=
b
∣
b
∣
y= 
∣b∣
b
​	
 , and 
z
=
c
∣
c
∣
z= 
∣c∣
c
​	
 , then the expression becomes 
x
+
y
+
z
+
x
y
z
x+y+z+xyz, where each of 
x
x, 
y
y, and 
z
z is either 1 or -1.

now, i need to find all possible values of 
x
+
y
+
z
+
x
y
z
x+y+z+xyz given that 
x
x, 
y
y, and 
z
z are each either 1 or -1.

let me list all possible combinations of 
x
x, 
y
y, and 
z
z, and compute 
x

y

z

x
y
z
x+y+z+xyz for each case.

−1+(−1)+(−1)+((−1)⋅(−1)⋅(−1))=−1−1−1−1=−4

so, from all these cases, the possible values of the expression are 4, 0, and -4.

wait a minute, in all cases except when all 
x
x, 
y
y, and 
z
z are 1 or all are -1, the sum is 0. only when all are 1, it's 4, and when all are -1, it's -4.

let me see if there are any other possibilities. are there any combinations where the sum is 2 or -2? from the above list, it seems not.

let me check another way. suppose i have two variables positive and one negative. for example, 
x
=
1
x=1, 
y
=
1
y=1, 
z
=
−
1
z=−1. then, 
x
+
y
+
z
+
x
y
z
=
1
+
1
−
1
+
(
1
⋅
1
⋅
−
1
)
=
1
+
1
−
1
−
1
=
0
x+y+z+xyz=1+1−1+(1⋅1⋅−1)=1+1−1−1=0.

if two are negative and one is positive, say 
x
=
−
1
x=−1, 
y
=
−
1
y=−1, 
z
=
1
z=1, then 
x
+
y
+
z
+
x
y
z
=
−
1
−
1
+
1
+
(
(
−
1
)
(
−
1
)
(
1
)
)
=
−
1
−
1
+
1
+
1
=
0
x+y+z+xyz=−1−1+1+((−1)(−1)(1))=−1−1+1+1=0.

if one is positive and two are negative, similar result.

only when all are positive or all are negative do we get 4 or -4, respectively.

therefore, the possible values of the expression are -4, 0, and 4.

let me see if there's a smarter way to see this without listing all cases. maybe by factoring or using some properties.

let's consider that 
x
+
y
+
z
+
x
y
z
=
(
x
+
y
+
z
)
+
x
y
z
x+y+z+xyz=(x+y+z)+xyz.

alternatively, perhaps there's a way to factor this expression.

wait, i recall that 
x
+
y
+
z
+
x
y
z
=
(
x
+
1
)
(
y
+
1
)
(
z
+
1
)
−
1
−
x
−
y
−
z
x+y+z+xyz=(x+1)(y+1)(z+1)−1−x−y−z, but that might not be helpful here.

alternatively, perhaps consider that when 
x
x, 
y
y, and 
z
z are each 1 or -1, their product 
x
y
z
xyz is 1 if there are an even number of -1's, and -1 if there are an odd number of -1's.

wait, no. actually, the product 
x
y
z
xyz is 1 if there are an even number of negative signs among 
x
x, 
y
y, and 
z
z, and -1 if there are an odd number of negative signs.

but in our earlier cases, when all are 1 (even number of -1's, which is zero), 
x
y
z
=
1
xyz=1, and when two are -1 and one is 1, 
x
y
z
=
1
xyz=1 (even number of -1's), but in our earlier calculation, the sum was 0.

wait, no. if two are -1 and one is 1, then 
x
y
z
=
(
−
1
)
(
−
1
)
(
1
)
=
1
xyz=(−1)(−1)(1)=1, which is even number of -1's, but in that case, 
x
+
y
+
z
+
x
y
z
=
−
1
−
1
+
1
+
1
=
0
x+y+z+xyz=−1−1+1+1=0.

similarly, if one is -1 and two are 1, 
x
y
z
=
−
1
xyz=−1, and 
x
+
y
+
z
+
x
y
z
=
1
+
1
−
1
−
1
=
0
x+y+z+xyz=1+1−1−1=0.

only when all are 1, 
x
y
z
=
1
xyz=1, and sum is 4; when all are -1, 
x
y
z
=
−
1
xyz=−1, and sum is -4.

so, it seems that the sum is 4 when all are positive, -4 when all are negative, and 0 otherwise.

is there a way to see this more generally?

let me think about the expression 
x
+
y
+
z
+
x
y
z
x+y+z+xyz, where 
x
,
y
,
z
=
±
1
x,y,z=±1.

suppose i group terms:

x
+
y
+
z
+
x
y
z
=
x
(
1
+
y
z
)
+
y
+
z
x+y+z+xyz=x(1+yz)+y+z

but that doesn't seem particularly helpful.

alternatively, maybe consider that 
x
+
y
+
z
+
x
y
z
=
(
x
+
y
+
z
)
+
x
y
z
x+y+z+xyz=(x+y+z)+xyz, and think about the possible sums.

wait, perhaps consider that if 
x
x, 
y
y, and 
z
z are all 1, then the sum is 4; if one of them is -1, say 
x
=
−
1
x=−1, then 
x
+
y
+
z
+
x
y
z
=
−

=

x+y+z+xyz=−1+1+1+(−1)(1)(1)=−1+1+1−1=0; similarly for other cases where not all are 1 or all are -1.

alternatively, think about the parity of the number of negative variables.

if all are positive, sum is 4; if two are negative, sum is 0; if one is negative, sum is 0; if all are negative, sum is -4.

so, only when all have the same sign do we get a sum of 4 or -4, and in other cases, sum is 0.

therefore, the possible values are -4, 0, and 4.

so, to answer the question, the possible values of the expression are

−4,0,4.

**final answer**
