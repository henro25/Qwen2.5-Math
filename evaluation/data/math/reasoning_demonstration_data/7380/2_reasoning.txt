Reasoning: So i've got this geometry problem here. there's a triangle abc with sides ab = 12, bc = 25, and ca = 17. inside this triangle, there's a rectangle pqrs with p on ab, q on ac, and r and s on bc. the side pq is given as ω, and the area of the rectangle is expressed as αω - βω². i need to find the coefficient β, expressed as a fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

first, i need to visualize this setup. triangle abc with sides ab = 12, bc = 25, and ca = 17. it might help to sketch this out. let's assume triangle abc is positioned with bc at the base. so, b and c are on the base, with bc = 25. a is at the top, with ab = 12 and ac = 17.

now, the rectangle pqrs has p on ab, q on ac, and r and s on bc. so, the rectangle is inscribed in the triangle in such a way that two of its vertices are on the sides ab and ac, and the other two are on bc.

let me try to understand the positions of p, q, r, and s. since r and s are on bc, and p and q are on ab and ac respectively, the rectangle is standing on bc with its top side pq connecting points on ab and ac.

let me consider coordinates to make this easier. maybe i can place point b at the origin (0,0), point c at (25,0), and point a somewhere in the plane such that ab = 12 and ac = 17.

first, i need to find the coordinates of point a. since ab = 12 and ac = 17, and bc = 25, i can use the distance formula to find the coordinates of a.

let me set coordinates:

let’s place point b at (0,0), and point c at (25,0). let’s denote point a as (x,y).

then, ab = 12, so the distance from a to b is:

√(x² + y²) = 12 ⇒ x² + y² = 144.

similarly, ac = 17, so the distance from a to c is:

√((x - 25)² + y²) = 17 ⇒ (x - 25)² + y² = 289.

now, subtract the first equation from the second:

(x - 25)² + y² - x² - y² = 289 - 144 ⇒ x² - 50x + 625 + y² - x² - y² = 145 ⇒ -50x + 625 = 145 ⇒ -50x = -480 ⇒ x = 9.6.

now, plug x back into x² + y² = 144:

(9.6)² + y² = 144 ⇒ 92.16 + y² = 144 ⇒ y² = 51.84 ⇒ y = √51.84 = 7.2.

so, point a is at (9.6, 7.2).

now, i need to find the rectangle pqrs with p on ab, q on ac, and r and s on bc.

let me denote the coordinates of p, q, r, and s.

let’s parameterize the positions.

let’s assume that pq is parallel to bc, since it's a rectangle, and bc is the base. so, pq should be horizontal if bc is horizontal.

wait, but in my coordinate setup, bc is on the x-axis, so if pq is parallel to bc, it should also be horizontal.

but in the problem, it says that r and s are on bc, and p is on ab, q is on ac. so, yes, pq should be parallel to bc.

therefore, pq is horizontal.

given that, i can consider that the rectangle has its top side pq parallel to bc, and its bottom side rs on bc.

so, the height of the rectangle is the y-coordinate of pq.

let’s denote the y-coordinate of pq as h. then, since pq is horizontal, its length is determined by the x-coordinates at that height.

wait, but pq is given as ω, so ω is the length of pq.

i need to express the area of pqrs in terms of ω, and find the coefficient β in the expression area = αω - βω².

first, i need to find a relationship between ω and h, and then express the area in terms of ω.

let me think about similar triangles here.

at height h from bc, the width of the triangle at that height can be found using similar triangles.

the entire height of the triangle is y = 7.2, so at height h, the width is proportional.

the width at height h is w(h) = (base width) * (1 - h / height).

base width is bc = 25, height is y = 7.2.

so, w(h) = 25 * (1 - h / 7.2).

but in this case, since pq is the top side of the rectangle, and rs is on bc, the width of the rectangle should be less than w(h), because the rectangle is inside the triangle.

wait, perhaps i need to consider that the rectangle has height equal to h, and its width is ω.

so, area of pqrs is ω * h.

but the problem states that area = αω - βω², which suggests a quadratic relationship between area and ω.

so, i need to express h in terms of ω, and then find area = ω * h in terms of ω.

alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to relate ω and h using the geometry of the triangle.

let me try to find expressions for h in terms of ω.

since pq is parallel to bc, and p is on ab, q is on ac, then triangles apq and abc are similar.

yes, because pq is parallel to bc, triangles apq ~ abc.

therefore, the ratio of similarity is equal to the ratio of their heights.

the height of abc is 7.2, and the height of apq is (7.2 - h), where h is the height of the rectangle.

wait, actually, the height from a to bc is 7.2, so the height from a to pq is (7.2 - h).

therefore, the ratio of similarity is (7.2 - h)/7.2.

since pq is the base of apq, and bc is the base of abc, then pq / bc = (7.2 - h)/7.2.

therefore, ω / 25 = (7.2 - h)/7.2 ⇒ ω = 25 * (7.2 - h)/7.2 ⇒ ω = (25/7.2) * (7.2 - h).

now, solve for h in terms of ω:

ω = (25/7.2)(7.2 - h) ⇒ 7.2 - h = (7.2/25)ω ⇒ h = 7.2 - (7.2/25)ω.

so, h = 7.2 - (7.2/25)ω.

now, the area of the rectangle pqrs is ω * h = ω * [7.2 - (7.2/25)ω] = 7.2ω - (7.2/25)ω².

therefore, area = αω - βω², where α = 7.2 and β = 7.2/25.

but the problem states that β should be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers.

so, β = 7.2 / 25.

but 7.2 is a decimal, and i need to express it as a fraction.

7.2 is equal to 72/10, which simplifies to 36/5.

therefore, β = (36/5)/25 = 36/(5*25) = 36/125.

so, m = 36 and n = 125.

therefore, m + n = 36 + 125 = 161.

wait, but i should check if 36 and 125 are relatively prime.

the factors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.

the factors of 125 are 1, 5, 25, 125.

they only share 1 as a common factor, so they are relatively prime.

therefore, m + n = 161.

but let me double-check my calculations to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

first, i found the coordinates of a by solving the system of equations based on distances ab and ac.

then, i used similar triangles to relate ω and h.

expressed area in terms of ω and h, then substituted h in terms of ω to get area = 7.2ω - (7.2/25)ω².

expressed β = 7.2/25, converted 7.2 to 36/5, then β = 36/125, which is already in simplest form.

so, m + n = 161.

**final answer**

161
