Problem: An arithmetic sequence consists of $ 200$ numbers that are each at least $ 10$ and at most $ 100$.  The sum of the numbers is $ 10{,}000$.  Let $ L$ be the least possible value of the $ 50$th term and let $ G$ be the greatest possible value of the $ 50$th term.  What is the value of $ G - L$?
