Reasoning: So i have this problem here: "the decimal expansion of 8/11 is a repeating decimal. what is the least number of digits in a repeating block of 8/11?" okay, let's see. i know that when you divide two numbers and the division doesn't come out evenly, you can get a decimal that either terminates or repeats. in this case, it's saying that 8 divided by 11 is a repeating decimal, and i need to find the smallest number of digits that repeat in that decimal.

first off, i should probably try dividing 8 by 11 to see what the decimal looks like. let's do that long division.

so, 11 goes into 8 zero times, so i write 0., and then bring down a zero to make 80.

now, 11 goes into 80 seven times because 11 times 7 is 77. so i write 7, subtract 77 from 80, and get 3.

bring down another zero to make 30. 11 goes into 30 two times, since 11 times 2 is 22. subtract 22 from 30, and get 8.

wait a minute, i've got 8 again. this seems familiar. so, bringing down another zero to make 80. and we already know that 11 goes into 80 seven times, and this cycle repeats.

so, the decimal expansion is 0.727272..., where "72" repeats indefinitely.

therefore, the repeating block is "72", which has two digits.

but the question is asking for the least number of digits in a repeating block. so, is it always two digits for 8/11?

let me check if there's a smaller repeating block. could it be just one digit repeating?

suppose the repeating block was one digit, like "7". then the decimal would be 0.7777..., which is 7/9. but 7/9 is not equal to 8/11, so that doesn't work.

alternatively, if it were "2" repeating, that would be 0.2222..., which is 2/9, also not equal to 8/11.

so, one digit doesn't work. what about two digits? we have 0.727272..., which is 72/99, since 0.ababab... equals ab/99.

let me check if 72/99 equals 8/11.

simplify 72/99: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 9. 72 ÷ 9 is 8, and 99 ÷ 9 is 11. so, 72/99 simplifies to 8/11. perfect, that matches.

so, the repeating block is "72", and it has two digits.

but is there a way to confirm that two is indeed the smallest possible number of digits in the repeating block?

i recall that for fractions of the form a/b, where b is co-prime to 10, the length of the repeating block is equal to the order of 10 modulo b.

in other words, the smallest positive integer k such that 10^k ≡ 1 mod b.

so, for b = 11, i need to find the smallest k where 10^k ≡ 1 mod 11.

let me calculate 10^k mod 11 for k = 1,2,3,...

10^1 = 10 mod 11 is 10.

10^2 = 100 mod 11. 11*9 = 99, so 100 - 99 = 1. so, 10^2 ≡ 1 mod 11.

therefore, k = 2 is the smallest integer where this holds.

this confirms that the repeating block has 2 digits.

alternatively, i can think about the period of the decimal expansion.

the period is the smallest number of digits that repeat.

given that 11 is a prime number, and 10 and 11 are co-prime, the period should divide φ(11), where φ is euler's totient function.

φ(11) = 10, since 11 is prime.

so, the period should be a divisor of 10.

the divisors of 10 are 1,2,5,10.

we've already seen that k=2 works, and k=1 doesn't.

so, the period is 2.

therefore, the least number of digits in a repeating block of 8/11 is 2.

**final answer**

2
