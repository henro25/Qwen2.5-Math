Reasoning: So i have this problem here: let x and y be nonzero real numbers. let m and m be the minimum value and maximum value of 
∣
x
+
y
∣
∣
x
∣
+
∣
y
∣
∣x∣+∣y∣
∣x+y∣
​	
 , respectively. find m - m.

alright, first thing i notice is that both x and y are nonzero real numbers, which means neither of them is zero, so the denominator 
∣
x
∣
+
∣
y
∣
∣x∣+∣y∣ is always positive. that’s good because it means the expression is always defined.

now, i need to find the minimum and maximum values of this expression. it looks like a ratio involving absolute values. maybe i can simplify it or find some bounds.

let me think about the properties of absolute values. i know that 
∣
x
+
y
∣
≤
∣
x
∣
+
∣
y
∣
∣x+y∣≤∣x∣+∣y∣, which is the triangle inequality. so, the numerator is always less than or equal to the denominator. that means the whole fraction is always less than or equal to 1.

wait, so the maximum value m is 1. is that correct? let me check.

if x and y have the same sign, say both positive, then 
∣
x
+
y
∣
=
∣
x
∣
+
∣
y
∣
∣x+y∣=∣x∣+∣y∣, so the fraction is 1. similarly, if both are negative, 
∣
x
+
y
∣
=
∣
x
∣
+
∣
y
∣
∣x+y∣=∣x∣+∣y∣, so again 1. so, yes, m is indeed 1.

now, what about the minimum value m? since the numerator is 
∣
x
+
y
∣
∣x+y∣, which is always non-negative, and the denominator is positive, the whole expression is always non-negative. so, the minimum possible value should be greater than or equal to 0.

but can it actually reach 0? let's see. for the expression to be zero, the numerator must be zero, i.e., 
∣
x
+
y
∣
=
0
∣x+y∣=0, which implies x + y = 0, so y = -x.

if y = -x, then 
∣
x
+
y
∣
=
∣
x
−
x
∣
=
0
∣x+y∣=∣x−x∣=0, and 
∣
x
∣
+
∣
y
∣
=
∣
x
∣
+
∣
−
x
∣
=
2
∣
x
∣
∣x∣+∣y∣=∣x∣+∣−x∣=2∣x∣, which is positive since x is nonzero. so, the expression becomes 0/positive, which is 0.

therefore, the minimum value m is 0.

so, m - m = 1 - 0 = 1.

wait a minute, but the problem says "nonzero real numbers," and y = -x is allowed since x is nonzero, so y is also nonzero in that case. so, yes, the minimum is indeed 0.

but let me double-check if there are any restrictions i'm missing. the problem only specifies that x and y are nonzero real numbers, so y = -x is acceptable.

alternatively, maybe i can approach this using properties of functions or optimization.

let’s consider the function 
f
(
x
,
y
)
=
∣
x
+
y
∣
∣
x
∣
+
∣
y
∣
f(x,y)= 
∣x∣+∣y∣
∣x+y∣
​	
 .

i can try to analyze this function by considering different cases based on the signs of x and y.

case 1: x and y are both positive.

then, 
∣
x
+
y
∣
=
x
+
y
∣x+y∣=x+y, and 
∣
x
∣
+
∣
y
∣
=
x
+
y
∣x∣+∣y∣=x+y, so 
f
(
x
,
y
)
=
1
f(x,y)=1.

case 2: x and y are both negative.

similarly, 
∣
x
+
y
∣
=
−
x
−
y
=
∣
x
∣
+
∣
y
∣
∣x+y∣=−x−y=∣x∣+∣y∣, so 
f
(
x
,
y
)
=
1
f(x,y)=1.

case 3: x positive, y negative, say y = -k where k > 0.

then, 
∣
x
+
y
∣
=
∣
x
−
k
∣
∣x+y∣=∣x−k∣, and 
∣
x
∣
+
∣
y
∣
=
x
+
k
∣x∣+∣y∣=x+k.

so, 
f
(
x
,
y
)
=
∣
x
−
k
∣
x
+
k
f(x,y)= 
x+k
∣x−k∣
​	
 .

now, 
∣
x
−
k
∣
∣x−k∣ is either x - k if x >= k, or k - x if x < k.

subcase 3a: x >= k.

then, 
f
(
x
,
y
)
=
x
−
k
x
+
k
f(x,y)= 
x+k
x−k
​	
 .

this simplifies to 
x
−
k
x
+
k
=
1
−
2
k
x
+
k
x+k
x−k
​	
 =1− 
x+k
2k
​	
 .

as x increases, the fraction approaches 1, and as x approaches k from above, it approaches 0.

subcase 3b: x < k.

then, 
f
(
x
,
y
)
=
k
−
x
x
+
k
=
k
−
x
x
+
k
f(x,y)= 
x+k
k−x
​	
 = 
x+k
k−x
​	
 .

this can be rewritten as 
k
−
x
x
+
k
=
k
−
x
x
+
k
x+k
k−x
​	
 = 
x+k
k−x
​	
 .

alternatively, note that 
k
−
x
x
+
k
=
k
−
x
x
+
k
=
k
−
x
x
+
k
x+k
k−x
​	
 = 
x+k
k−x
​	
 = 
x+k
k−x
​	
 .

this fraction is always less than 1 and greater than or equal to 0 in this subcase.

similarly, as x approaches 0, 
f
(
x
,
y
)
f(x,y) approaches 
k
k
=
1
k
k
​	
 =1, and as x approaches k from below, it approaches 0.

so, in both subcases of case 3, 
f
(
x
,
y
)
f(x,y) ranges from 0 to 1.

therefore, combining all cases, the expression 
f
(
x
,
y
)
f(x,y) ranges from 0 to 1, so m = 0 and m = 1, and m - m = 1 - 0 = 1.

but wait, is there any scenario where 
f
(
x
,
y
)
f(x,y) could be negative? no, because both numerator and denominator are absolute values, which are non-negative. so, the expression is always non-negative.

also, we've established that it can reach 0 and 1, and no values outside this range.

therefore, the final answer is m - m = 1 - 0 = 1.
