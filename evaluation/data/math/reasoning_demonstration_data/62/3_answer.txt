Answer: To determine the shape described by the equation \(\phi = c\) in spherical coordinates \((\rho, \theta, \phi)\), we need to understand the meaning of \(\phi\). \(\phi\) is the angle from the positive \(z\)-axis to the point. when \(\phi\) is constant, all points on the surface make the same angle \(c\) with the positive \(z\)-axis.

this configuration describes a cone with its apex at the origin and its axis along the \(z\)-axis. the angle \(c\) is the half-angle between the axis and the surface of the cone.

to confirm this, we can derive the cartesian coordinates from spherical coordinates:
\[
x = \rho \sin \phi \cos \theta, \quad y = \rho \sin \phi \sin \theta, \quad z = \rho \cos \phi
\]
given \(\phi = c\), we have:
\[
z = \rho \cos c
\]
and
\[
\rho = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
\]
substituting \(z = \rho \cos c\) into the equation for \(\rho\):
\[
z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \cos c
\]
squaring both sides:
\[
z^2 = (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) \cos^2 c
\]
rearranging terms:
\[
z^2 (1 - \cos^2 c) = x^2 \cos^2 c + y^2 \cos^2 c
\]
using \(1 - \cos^2 c = \sin^2 c\):
\[
z^2 \sin^2 c = x^2 \cos^2 c + y^2 \cos^2 c
\]
dividing both sides by \(\cos^2 c\):
\[
\frac{z^2 \sin^2 c}{\cos^2 c} = x^2 + y^2
\]
simplifying:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \tan^2 c
\]
this is the equation of a cone with half-angle \(c\).

therefore, the shape described by \(\phi = c\) is a cone.
