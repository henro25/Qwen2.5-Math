Answer: Robert has 4 indistinguishable gold coins and 4 indistinguishable silver coins, each with a face on one side. he wants to stack the 8 coins such that no two adjacent coins are face to face. we need to find the number of possible distinguishable arrangements.

first, we determine the number of ways to arrange the types of coins. this is given by the combination \( \binom{8}{4} = 70 \).

next, we consider the orientations of the coins. we need to ensure that no two adjacent coins are face to face, which translates to avoiding the sequence "ud" (face up followed by face down).

we define:
- \( a_n \): number of valid sequences of length \( n \) ending with u.
- \( b_n \): number of valid sequences of length \( n \) ending with d.

the recurrence relations are:
- \( a_n = a_{n-1} \)
- \( b_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} \)

with base cases:
- \( a_1 = 1 \)
- \( b_1 = 1 \)

we compute these up to \( n = 8 \):

\[
\begin{align*}
a_2 &= a_1 = 1 \\
b_2 &= a_1 + b_1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \\
a_3 &= a_2 = 1 \\
b_3 &= a_2 + b_2 = 1 + 2 = 3 \\
a_4 &= a_3 = 1 \\
b_4 &= a_3 + b_3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\
a_5 &= a_4 = 1 \\
b_5 &= a_4 + b_4 = 1 + 4 = 5 \\
a_6 &= a_5 = 1 \\
b_6 &= a_5 + b_5 = 1 + 5 = 6 \\
a_7 &= a_6 = 1 \\
b_7 &= a_6 + b_6 = 1 + 6 = 7 \\
a_8 &= a_7 = 1 \\
b_8 &= a_7 + b_7 = 1 + 7 = 8 \\
\end{align*}
\]

thus, the total number of valid orientation sequences for \( n = 8 \) is \( s_8 = a_8 + b_8 = 1 + 8 = 9 \).

finally, the total number of possible distinguishable arrangements is the product of the number of type arrangements and the number of valid orientation sequences:

\[
70 \times 9 = 630
\]

therefore, the number of possible distinguishable arrangements is:

\[
\boxed{630}
\]
