Reasoning: Let's tackle this problem: simplify 
7
⋅
2
⋅
2
3
⋅
7
3
7⋅2
​
 ⋅ 
2 
3
 ⋅7 
3
 
​
 . hmm, okay, so i need to simplify this expression involving square roots and exponents. i remember that there are some rules about multiplying square roots and dealing with exponents, so i should probably recall those first.

first, i know that 
a
⋅
b
=
a
⋅
b
a
​
 ⋅ 
b
​
 = 
a⋅b
​
 , as long as 
a
a and 
b
b are non-negative. so maybe i can combine these two square roots into one. let's try that.

so, 
7
⋅
2
⋅
2
3
⋅
7
3
=
(
7
⋅
2
)
⋅
(
2
3
⋅
7
3
)
7⋅2
​
 ⋅ 
2 
3
 ⋅7 
3
 
​
 = 
(7⋅2)⋅(2 
3
 ⋅7 
3
 )
​
 . that seems right.

now, let's simplify the expression inside the square root. i have 
7
⋅
2
7⋅2 times 
2
3
⋅
7
3
2 
3
 ⋅7 
3
 . i can rearrange the multiplication because multiplication is commutative. so, 
7
⋅
7
3
7⋅7 
3
  times 
2
⋅
2
3
2⋅2 
3
 .

wait, no, actually, it's 
7
⋅
2
⋅
2
3
⋅
7
3
7⋅2⋅2 
3
 ⋅7 
3
 , which can be grouped as 
7
1
⋅
7
3
⋅
2
1
⋅
2
3
7 
1
 ⋅7 
3
 ⋅2 
1
 ⋅2 
3
 .

i remember that when you multiply like bases with exponents, you add the exponents. so, 
7
1
+
3
⋅
2
1
+
3
=
7
4
⋅
2
4
7 
1+3
 ⋅2 
1+3
 =7 
4
 ⋅2 
4
 .

so now, the expression is 
7
4
⋅
2
4
7 
4
 ⋅2 
4
 
​
 .

hmm, square roots and exponents. i know that 
a
2
=
a
a 
2
 
​
 =a if 
a
a is non-negative. so, maybe i can apply that here.

wait, 
7
4
7 
4
  is 
(
7
2
)
2
(7 
2
 ) 
2
 , and 
2
4
2 
4
  is 
(
2
2
)
2
(2 
2
 ) 
2
 . so, 
(
7
2
)
2
⋅
(
2
2
)
2
(7 
2
 ) 
2
 ⋅(2 
2
 ) 
2
 
​
 .

that seems a bit complicated. maybe there's a better way. let me think.

alternatively, i can think of 
7
4
⋅
2
4
7 
4
 ⋅2 
4
  as 
(
7
⋅
2
)
4
(7⋅2) 
4
 , because when you multiply like exponents, you can factor them out.

so, 
(
7
⋅
2
)
4
(7⋅2) 
4
 
​
 .

now, 
a
4
=
a
2
a 
4
 
​
 =a 
2
 , since 
(
a
2
)
2
=
a
4
(a 
2
 ) 
2
 =a 
4
 . so, 
(
7
⋅
2
)
4
=
(
7
⋅
2
)
2
(7⋅2) 
4
 
​
 =(7⋅2) 
2
 .

that makes sense. so, 
(
7
⋅
2
)
2
=
1
4
2
(7⋅2) 
2
 =14 
2
 , because 
7
⋅
2
=
14
7⋅2=14.

and 
1
4
2
14 
2
  is 
196
196. so, is the answer 
196
196?

wait a minute, maybe i should check my steps to make sure i didn't make a mistake.

let's go back to the beginning. i had 
7
⋅
2
⋅
2
3
⋅
7
3
7⋅2
​
 ⋅ 
2 
3
 ⋅7 
3
 
​
 , which became 
(
7
⋅
2
)
⋅
(
2
3
⋅
7
3
)
(7⋅2)⋅(2 
3
 ⋅7 
3
 )
​
 .

then, i combined the exponents: 
7
1
+
3
⋅
2
1
+
3
=
7
4
⋅
2
4
7 
1+3
 ⋅2 
1+3
 =7 
4
 ⋅2 
4
 .

then, i recognized that this is 
(
7
⋅
2
)
4
=
1
4
4
(7⋅2) 
4
 =14 
4
 , but actually, 
7
4
⋅
2
4
=
(
7
⋅
2
)
4
=
1
4
4
7 
4
 ⋅2 
4
 =(7⋅2) 
4
 =14 
4
 , but wait, no, that's not right.

wait, no, 
a
n
⋅
b
n
=
(
a
⋅
b
)
n
a 
n
 ⋅b 
n
 =(a⋅b) 
n
 , yes, that's correct. so, 
7
4
⋅
2
4
=
(
7
⋅
2
)
4
=
1
4
4
7 
4
 ⋅2 
4
 =(7⋅2) 
4
 =14 
4
 .

but then, i took the square root of that: 
1
4
4
=
1
4
2
=
196
14 
4
 
​
 =14 
2
 =196.

alternatively, i could have taken the square root of 
7
4
7 
4
  and 
2
4
2 
4
  separately.

let me try that approach. 
7
4
⋅
2
4
=
7
4
⋅
2
4
=
7
2
⋅
2
2
=
49
⋅
4
=
196
7 
4
 ⋅2 
4
 
​
 = 
7 
4
 
​
 ⋅ 
2 
4
 
​
 =7 
2
 ⋅2 
2
 =49⋅4=196. okay, that confirms the previous answer.

so, both methods lead me to 196. that seems consistent.

alternatively, i could have simplified the exponents before taking the square roots.

let me try that. starting with 
7
⋅
2
⋅
2
3
⋅
7
3
7⋅2
​
 ⋅ 
2 
3
 ⋅7 
3
 
​
 .

i can write this as 
14
⋅
8
⋅
343
14
​
 ⋅ 
8⋅343
​
 , but that seems messy. maybe not the best approach.

alternatively, i could factor the exponents differently. for example, 
2
3
=
2
2
⋅
2
1
2 
3
 =2 
2
 ⋅2 
1
 , and 
7
3
=
7
2
⋅
7
1
7 
3
 =7 
2
 ⋅7 
1
 .

so, 
2
1
⋅
7
1
⋅
2
2
⋅
7
2
⋅
2
1
⋅
7
1
2 
1
 ⋅7 
1
 
​
 ⋅ 
2 
2
 ⋅7 
2
 ⋅2 
1
 ⋅7 
1
 
​
 .

wait, that seems more complicated. maybe i should stick with the earlier method.

alternatively, i can use the property that 
a
⋅
b
=
a
⋅
b
a
​
 ⋅ 
b
​
 = 
a⋅b
​
 , which i already did.

i think i'm confident that the answer is 196.

let me try plugging in the numbers to verify.

first, calculate 
7
⋅
2
7⋅2
​
 . 
7
⋅
2
=
14
7⋅2=14, so 
14
14
​
 .

then, 
2
3
⋅
7
3
2 
3
 ⋅7 
3
 
​
 . 
2
3
=
8
2 
3
 =8, 
7
3
=
343
7 
3
 =343, so 
8
⋅
343
=
2744
8⋅343
​
 = 
2744
​
 .

now, 
14
⋅
2744
=
14
⋅
2744
14
​
 ⋅ 
2744
​
 = 
14⋅2744
​
 . what is 
14
⋅
2744
14⋅2744?

let me calculate that: 
14
×
2744
14×2744.

first, 10 times 2744 is 27,440.

then, 4 times 2744 is 10,976.

adding them together: 27,440 + 10,976 = 38,416.

so, 
38
,
416
38,416
​
 . what's the square root of 38,416?

well, 196 squared is 38,416, because 200 squared is 40,000, and 196 is 4 less, so 196^2 = 38,416.

therefore, 
38
,
416
=
196
38,416
​
 =196, which matches my earlier result.

so, yes, the simplified form is 196.

alternatively, if i had to leave it in terms of exponents or variables, but since it's all numerical, 196 is the simplest form.

i don't think there's any further simplification needed unless i express it in some other form, but 196 is already a whole number.

so, the final answer should be 196.

**final answer**

196
196
