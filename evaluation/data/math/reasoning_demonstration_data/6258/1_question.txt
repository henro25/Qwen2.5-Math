Problem: A circle centered at $A$ with a radius of $1$ and a circle centered at $B$ with a radius of $4$ are externally tangent. A third circle is tangent to the first two and to one of their common external tangents as shown. What is the radius of the third circle? [asy]
draw((-3,0)--(7.5,0));
draw(Circle((-1,1),1),linewidth(0.7));
draw(Circle((3,4),4),linewidth(0.7));
draw(Circle((0.33,0.44),0.44),linewidth(0.7));
dot((-1,1));
dot((3,4));
draw((-1,1)--(-2,1));
draw((3,4)--(7,4));
label("$A$",(-1,1),E);
label("$B$",(3,4),W);
label("1",(-1.5,1),N);
label("4",(5,4),N);
