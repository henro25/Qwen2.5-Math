Answer: Given the polynomial \( p(x) = 8x^3 - 4x^2 - 42x + 45 \) and the fact that it is divisible by \((x - r)^2\), we need to find \( r \).

since \((x - r)^2\) divides \( p(x) \), \( r \) must be a double root of \( p(x) \). this implies that both \( p(r) = 0 \) and \( p'(r) = 0 \).

first, we find the derivative of \( p(x) \):
\[ p'(x) = 24x^2 - 8x - 42 \]

we solve the system of equations:
1. \( p(r) = 8r^3 - 4r^2 - 42r + 45 = 0 \)
2. \( p'(r) = 24r^2 - 8r - 42 = 0 \)

solving the quadratic equation \( 24r^2 - 8r - 42 = 0 \):
\[ 12r^2 - 4r - 21 = 0 \]
using the quadratic formula:
\[ r = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 1008}}{24} = \frac{4 \pm 32}{24} \]
this gives:
\[ r = \frac{36}{24} = \frac{3}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad r = \frac{-28}{24} = -\frac{7}{6} \]

we check which of these values satisfy \( p(r) = 0 \):

for \( r = \frac{3}{2} \):
\[ p\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = 8\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^3 - 4\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - 42\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) + 45 = 0 \]

for \( r = -\frac{7}{6} \):
\[ p\left(-\frac{7}{6}\right) \neq 0 \]

thus, the only value that satisfies both conditions is \( r = \frac{3}{2} \).

therefore, the value of \( r \) is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{3}{2}}
\]
