Reasoning: So i have this problem here: for some real number 
r
r, the polynomial 
8
x
3
−
4
x
2
−
42
x
+
45
8x 
3
 −4x 
2
 −42x+45 is divisible by 
(
x
−
r
)
2
(x−r) 
2
 . i need to find 
r
r.

okay, first things first, if a polynomial is divisible by 
(
x
−
r
)
2
(x−r) 
2
 , that means that 
r
r is not just a root of the polynomial, but a double root. so, not only does the polynomial equal zero at 
x
=
r
x=r, but its derivative also equals zero at that point. that makes sense because for a double root, the graph just touches the x-axis and doesn't cross it, which implies that both the function and its slope are zero there.

so, let me denote the polynomial as 
p
(
x
)
=
8
x
3
−
4
x
2
−
42
x
+
45
p(x)=8x 
3
 −4x 
2
 −42x+45. since 
(
x
−
r
)
2
(x−r) 
2
  divides 
p
(
x
)
p(x), then both 
p
(
r
)
=
0
p(r)=0 and 
p
′
(
r
)
=
0
p 
′
 (r)=0.

first, i need to find the derivative of 
p
(
x
)
p(x). the derivative 
p
′
(
x
)
p 
′
 (x) is 
24
x
2
−
8
x
−
42
24x 
2
 −8x−42.

now, i have two equations:

1. 
p
(
r
)
=
8
r
3
−
4
r
2
−
42
r
+
45
=
0
p(r)=8r 
3
 −4r 
2
 −42r+45=0

2. 
p
′
(
r
)
=
24
r
2
−
8
r
−
42
=
0
p 
′
 (r)=24r 
2
 −8r−42=0

i need to solve these simultaneously to find the value of 
r
r.

hmm, solving two equations with one variable should be straightforward. i can solve the second equation for 
r
r and then plug that value into the first equation to verify.

let me start with the derivative equation:

24
r
2
−
8
r
−
42
=
0
24r 
2
 −8r−42=0

i can simplify this by dividing all terms by 2:

12
r
2
−
4
r
−
21
=
0
12r 
2
 −4r−21=0

now, i can use the quadratic formula to solve for 
r
r:

r
=
4
±
(
−
4
)
2
−
4
⋅
12
⋅
(
−
21
)
2
⋅
12
r= 
2⋅12
4± 
(−4) 
2
 −4⋅12⋅(−21)
​
 
​
 

calculating inside the square root:

(
−
4
)
2
=
16
(−4) 
2
 =16

4
⋅
12
⋅
(
−
21
)
=
−
1008
4⋅12⋅(−21)=−1008

so,

r
=
4
±
16
−
(
−
1008
)
24
r= 
24
4± 
16−(−1008)
​
 
​
 

r
=
4
±
16
+
1008
24
r= 
24
4± 
16+1008
​
 
​
 

r
=
4
±
1024
24
r= 
24
4± 
1024
​
 
​
 

1024
=
32
1024
​
 =32, so:

r
=
4
±
32
24
r= 
24
4±32
​
 

this gives two possible solutions:

1. 
r
=
4
+
32
24
=
36
24
=
3
2
r= 
24
4+32
​
 = 
24
36
​
 = 
2
3
​
 

2. 
r
=
4
−
32
24
=
−
28
24
=
−
7
6
r= 
24
4−32
​
 = 
24
−28
​
 =−

​
 

now, i need to check which of these values actually satisfy the original polynomial equation 
p
(
r
)
=
0
p(r)=0.

let's first check 
r
=
3
2
r= 
2
3
​
 :

p
(
3
2
)
=
8
(
3

)
3
−
4
(

)
2
−

+

p(

​
 )=8(

3
​
 ) 
3
 −4( 
2
3
​
 ) 
2
 −42(

​
 )+45

calculating step by step:

(

)
3
=

​
 ) 
3
 =

42
⋅

​

so,

p

)
=
27
−
9
−
63
+
45
=
(
27
−

+
(
−

)
=

−
18
=

p( 
2
3
​
 )=27−9−63+45=(27−9)+(−63+45)=18−18=0

great, 
r
=
3
2
r= 
2
3
​
  is a root.

now, let's check 
r
=
−
7
6
r=− 
6

​
 :

p
(
−

)
=

​
 ) 
3
 −4(−

​
 )

 −42(−

calculating step by step:

so,

p(−

​
 )=− 
27
343
​
 − 
9
49
​
 +49+45

to add these, i need a common denominator, which is 27:

−
343
27
−
147
27
+
49
⋅
27
27
+
45
⋅

​

27
45⋅27
​
 

−
343
+
147
27
+
1323
+
1215
27
− 
27
343+147
​
 + 
27
1323+1215
​
 

−
490
27
+
2538
27
=
2538
−
490
27
=
2048
27
− 
27
490
​
 + 
27
2538
​
 = 
27
2538−490
​
 = 
27
2048
​
 

which is not zero. so, 
r
=
−
7
6
r=− 
6
7
​
  is not a root of the original polynomial. that means only 
r
=
3
2
r= 
2
3
​
  is the value that satisfies both conditions.

wait a minute, but the problem says that 
(
x
−
r
)
2
(x−r) 
2
  divides the polynomial, which implies that 
r
r is a double root. but in my calculation, 
r
=
−
7
6
r=− 
6
7
​
  doesn't satisfy 
p
(
r
)
=
0
p(r)=0, so it can't be a root at all, let alone a double root. so, only 
r
=
3
2
r= 
2
3
​
  is the possible solution.

but just to be thorough, maybe i made a mistake in calculating 
p
(
−
7
6
)
p(− 
6
7
​
 ). let's double-check that.

recalculating 
p
(
−
7

)
p(− 
6
7
​
 ):

8
(
−

3
=

⋅
(

216

​

​
  (this seems correct.)

so,

−

9
+
49
+
45
p(−

​
 )=− 
27
343
​
 −

​
 +49+45

convert all terms to have denominator 27:

−
343
27
−
147
27
+
1323
27
+
1215
27

1215
​
 = 
27
−343−147+1323+1215
​
 = 
27
2048
​
 , which is indeed not zero.

so, 
r
=
−
7
6
r=− 
6
7
​
  is not a root, hence not a double root.

therefore, the only possible value for 
r
r is 
3
2
2
3
​
 .

but to be extra sure, maybe i should consider if there are any other possibilities or if i missed something.

alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this problem, like using polynomial division or factoring.

let me try factoring the polynomial 
p
(
x
)
=
8
x
3
−
4
x
2
−
42
x
+
45
p(x)=8x 
3
 −4x 
2
 −42x+45.

i can attempt to factor it by grouping or by finding rational roots using the rational root theorem.

according to the rational root theorem, any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms 
p
q
q
p
​
 , has 
p
p as a factor of the constant term and 
q
q as a factor of the leading coefficient.

so, possible rational roots are 
±
1
,
±
3
,
±
5
,
±
9
,
±
15
,
±
45
±1,±3,±5,±9,±15,±45 divided by 
±
1
,
±
2
,
±
4
,
±
8
±1,±2,±4,±8, giving possible roots like 
±
1
,
±

2
,
±1,± 
2

​
 ,± 
2
3
​
 ,± 
2
5
​
 , etc.

from my earlier calculation, 
r
=
3
2
r= 
2
3
​
  is a root, so perhaps i can factor 
p
(
x
)
p(x) as 
(
x
−
3
2
)
2
(x− 
2
3
​
 ) 
2
  times another linear factor.

but actually, since 
(
x
−
r
)
2
(x−r) 
2
  divides 
p
(
x
)
p(x), and 
p
(
x
)
p(x) is a cubic polynomial, it should have one double root and one simple root.

so, 
p
(
x
)
=
(
x
−
r
)
2
(
a
x
+
b
)
p(x)=(x−r) 
2
 (ax+b), where 
a
a and 
b
b are constants to be determined.

given that

x

p(x)=8x

2
 −42x+45, let's set up the equation:

first, expand 
(

=

−

r
x

2
 −2rx+r

now, multiply by 
a
x

b
ax+b:

(
x

−

r
x

r

)
(
a

 )(ax+b)=ax 
3
 +bx 
2
 −2arx

 −2brx+ar 
2
 x+br

combine like terms:

(

x

b
r

set this equal to

−
4
x
2
−
42
x
+
45
8x 
3
 −4x 
2
 −42x+45:

so, we have:

1. 
a
=

a=8

2. 
b
−

a
r
=

b−2ar=−4

3.

−2br+ar 
2
 =−42

4. 
b
r
2
=
45
br 
2
 =45

now, since 
a
=
8
a=8, plug that into equation 2:

b
−
16
r
=
−
4
b−16r=−4 => 
b
=
16
r
−
4
b=16r−4

plug 
a
=
8
a=8 and 
b
=
16
r
−
4
b=16r−4 into equation 3:

−
2
(
16
r
−
4
)
r
+
8
r
2
=
−
42
−2(16r−4)r+8r 
2
 =−42

simplify:

−
32
r
2
+
8
r
+
8
r
2
=
−
42
−32r 
2
 +8r+8r 
2
 =−42

−
24
r
2
+
8
r
=
−
42
−24r 
2
 +8r=−42

bring all terms to one side:

−
24
r
2
+
8
r
+
42
=
0
−24r 
2
 +8r+42=0

multiply both sides by -1:

24
r
2
−
8
r
−
42
=
0
24r 
2
 −8r−42=0

wait a minute, this is the same equation i had earlier for the derivative! interesting.

so, solving 
24
r
2
−
8
r
−
42
=
0
24r 
2
 −8r−42=0, which simplifies to 
12
r
2
−
4
r
−
21
=
0
12r 
2
 −4r−21=0, and then to 
r
=
3
2
r= 
2
3
​
  or 
r
=
−
7
6
r=− 
6
7
​
 , as before.

and as previously determined, only 
r
=
3
2
r= 
2
3
​
  satisfies 
p
(
r
)
=
0
p(r)=0, so that must be the correct value.

alternatively, maybe there's a way to find 
r
r without going through derivatives or factoring, perhaps by using the relationship between the roots and coefficients.

let me recall that for a cubic polynomial 
a
x
3
+
b
x

 , and the product of the roots is

 .

now, since 
r
r is a double root, let's denote the roots as 
r
,
r
,
s
r,r,s, where 
s
s is the other distinct root.

then:

sum of roots: 
r
+
r
+
s
=

r
+
s
=

r+r+s=2r+s=

​
  => 
s

​
 

now, i can substitute 
s

r
s=

​
 −2r into the other equations.

first, the sum of products:

 −2r)=r

 +r−4r

 =−3r

 +r=−

​
 

so:

−

r

r

=

−3r

 +r+

multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate fractions:

−
12
r
2
+
4
r
+
21
=

−12r 
2
 +4r+21=0

which is the same as:

12
r
2
−
4
r
−
21
=

12r 
2
 −4r−21=0

again, this leads back to the same quadratic equation i had earlier.

so, solving 
12
r
2
−
4
r
−
21
=
0
12r 
2
 −4r−21=0, we get 
r
=

r=

​
  or 
r
=
−

r=−

​
 , and only 
r
=
3
2
r=

​
  satisfies 
p

=

p(r)=0.

therefore, the value of 
r
