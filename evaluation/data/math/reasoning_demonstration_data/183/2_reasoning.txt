Reasoning: Alright, so I have this math problem here. It says: What is the positive difference between (6 squared plus 6 squared) divided by 6 and (6 squared times 6 squared) divided by 6. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I need to find out what 6 squared is. I remember that squaring a number means multiplying it by itself, so 6 times 6 is 36. Okay, so 6 squared is 36.

Now, the first part of the problem is (6 squared plus 6 squared) divided by 6. So that's (36 + 36) divided by 6. Let's add those up: 36 plus 36 is 72. Then, 72 divided by 6. I think 6 goes into 72 twelve times because 6 times 12 is 72. So, that part is 12.

Next, the second part is (6 squared times 6 squared) divided by 6. Again, 6 squared is 36, so that's (36 times 36) divided by 6. I need to multiply 36 by 36. Let me think. 36 times 30 is 1080, and 36 times 6 is 216. Adding those together, 1080 plus 216 is 1296. Now, divide that by 6. 1296 divided by 6. 6 goes into 1296 exactly 216 times because 6 times 200 is 1200, and 6 times 16 is 96, so 200 plus 16 is 216.

So, now I have the two results: 12 and 216. The problem asks for the positive difference between them. That means I need to subtract the smaller one from the larger one. So, 216 minus 12 is... let's see, 216 minus 10 is 206, minus 2 is 204. So, the positive difference is 204.

Wait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First part: (6^2 + 6^2)/6 = (36 + 36)/6 = 72/6 = 12. That seems correct.

Second part: (6^2 * 6^2)/6 = (36 * 36)/6 = 1296/6 = 216. That also looks right.

Difference: 216 - 12 = 204. Yeah, that's the answer.

I think I'm good here.
