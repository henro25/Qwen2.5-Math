Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: i need to find out how many cubic feet are in the volume of a round swimming pool that's 16 feet in diameter and 4 feet deep throughout. and i need to express the answer in terms of π. okay, let's see.

first, i know that the pool is round, so it's probably a cylinder shape. yeah, swimming pools are usually cylindrical if they're round and have the same depth throughout. so, the formula for the volume of a cylinder is π times the radius squared times the height. that is, v = πr²h.

alright, i need to find the radius. the diameter is given as 16 feet, so the radius is half of that. that means the radius is 8 feet. got it.

now, the depth is 4 feet, which, in the context of the cylinder, is the height. so, h = 4 feet.

plugging these values into the formula: v = π * (8 ft)² * 4 ft.

let me calculate (8 ft)² first. 8 squared is 64, so v = π * 64 ft² * 4 ft.

now, multiply 64 ft² by 4 ft. 64 times 4 is 256. so, v = π * 256 ft³.

wait a minute, is that it? it seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure i didn't miss anything.

the pool is round and has a constant depth, so yes, it should be a cylinder. diameter is 16 feet, so radius is 8 feet. depth is 4 feet, which is the height of the cylinder.

alternatively, i could think about the area of the base times the height. the base is a circle with area πr², which is π*(8)² = 64π ft². then, volume is area times height, so 64π * 4 = 256π ft³. that matches what i got earlier.

hmm, maybe i should consider if the pool has any other features that might affect the volume, but the problem says it's a round swimming pool that's 16 feet in diameter and 4 feet deep throughout. no mention of steps, shelves, or varying depths. so, i think assuming it's a perfect cylinder is fine.

just to be thorough, let's recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder: v = πr²h. yeah, that's what i used.

let me check the units to make sure they're consistent. the diameter and depth are both in feet, so the volume will be in cubic feet, which is what the problem is asking for.

is there any other way to approach this problem? maybe using the diameter directly instead of the radius? let's see.

the formula can also be written in terms of diameter: since r = d/2, then v = π*(d/2)²*h = π*(d²/4)*h.

plugging in d = 16 ft and h = 4 ft: v = π*(256/4)*4 = π*64*4 = 256π ft³. again, the same answer.

okay, that reinforces that 256π is the correct volume.

i think i've got it. the volume of the pool is 256π cubic feet.

**final answer**

256π
