Answer: To find the volume of a round swimming pool that is 16 feet in diameter and 4 feet deep throughout, we use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: \( v = \pi r^2 h \).

1. the diameter of the pool is 16 feet, so the radius \( r \) is half of that:
   \[
   r = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. the depth (height) \( h \) of the pool is 4 feet.

3. plugging these values into the volume formula:
   \[
   v = \pi (8)^2 (4)
   \]

4. calculate \( (8)^2 \):
   \[
   8^2 = 64
   \]

5. multiply by the height:
   \[
   v = \pi \times 64 \times 4 = 256\pi
   \]

thus, the volume of the pool is \(\boxed{256\pi}\) cubic feet.
