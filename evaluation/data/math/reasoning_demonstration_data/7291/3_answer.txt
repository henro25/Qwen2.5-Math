Answer: 1. **Identify the relationship:**
   - Mickey's age is 4 years less than 300% of Jerry's age.
   - 300% of Jerry's age is equivalent to 3 times Jerry's age.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - Let Jerry's age be \( J \).
   - Mickey's age = \( 3J - 4 \).
   - Given Mickey is 14 years old:
     \[
     14 = 3J - 4
     \]

3. **Solve for \( J \):**
   - Add 4 to both sides:
     \[
     14 + 4 = 3J
     \]
     \[
     18 = 3J
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 3:
     \[
     J = \frac{18}{3} = 6
     \]

4. **Verification:**
   - 300% of 6 is \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \).
   - 18 minus 4 equals 14, which matches Mickey's age.

**Answer:** Jerry is 6 years old.
