Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: evaluate 
i
11
+
i
16
+
i
21
+
i
26
+
i
31
i 
11
 +i 
16
 +i 
21
 +i 
26
 +i 
31
 . hmm, okay, i know that 
i
i is the imaginary unit, where 
i
=
−
1
i= 
−1
​	
 . and i remember that there's a pattern to the powers of 
i
i. let me try to recall that.

so, 
i
1
=
i
i 
1
 =i, 
i
2
=
−
1
i 
2
 =−1, 
i
3
=
−
i
i 
3
 =−i, and 
i
4
=
1
i 
4
 =1. then it repeats every four powers because 
i
5
=
i
i 
5
 =i again, and so on. so, the powers of 
i
i cycle every four exponents: 
i
,
−
1
,
−
i
,
1
,
i
,
−
1
,
−
i
,
1
,
i,−1,−i,1,i,−1,−i,1, etc.

given that, maybe i can find a way to simplify each of these terms by finding their equivalent within this 4-cycle.

let's start with 
i
11
i 
11
 . to find where 11 falls in the cycle, i can divide 11 by 4 and look at the remainder.

11 divided by 4 is 2 with a remainder of 3, because 4 times 2 is 8, and 11 minus 8 is 3.

so, 
i
11
=
i
4
×
2
+
3
=
(
i
4
)
2
×
i
3
=
1
2
×
(
−
i
)
=
−
i
i 
11
 =i 
4×2+3
 =(i 
4
 ) 
2
 ×i 
3
 =1 
2
 ×(−i)=−i.

alright, so 
i
11
=
−
i
i 
11
 =−i.

next, 
i
16
i 
16
 . let's see, 16 divided by 4 is 4 with a remainder of 0, since 4 times 4 is exactly 16.

so, 
i
16
=
i
4
×
4
=
(
i
4
)
4
=
1
4
=
1
i 
16
 =i 
4×4
 =(i 
4
 ) 
4
 =1 
4
 =1.

therefore, 
i
16
=
1
i 
16
 =1.

moving on to 
i
21
i 
21
 . dividing 21 by 4 gives 5 with a remainder of 1, because 4 times 5 is 20, and 21 minus 20 is 1.

so, 
i
21
=
i
4
×
5
+
1
=
(
i
4
)
5
×
i
1
=
1
5
×
i
=
i
i 
21
 =i 
4×5+1
 =(i 
4
 ) 
5
 ×i 
1
 =1 
5
 ×i=i.

thus, 
i
21
=
i
i 
21
 =i.

now, 
i
26
i 
26
 . dividing 26 by 4 gives 6 with a remainder of 2, since 4 times 6 is 24, and 26 minus 24 is 2.

therefore, 
i
26
=
i
4
×
6
+
2
=
(
i
4
)
6
×
i
2
=
1
6
×
(
−
1
)
=
−
1
i 
26
 =i 
4×6+2
 =(i 
4
 ) 
6
 ×i 
2
 =1 
6
 ×(−1)=−1.

so, 
i
26
=
−
1
i 
26
 =−1.

finally, 
i
31
i 
31
 . dividing 31 by 4 gives 7 with a remainder of 3, because 4 times 7 is 28, and 31 minus 28 is 3.

thus, 
i
31
=
i
4
×
7
+
3
=
(
i
4
)
7
×
i
3
=
1
7
×
(
−
i
)
=
−
i
i 
31
 =i 
4×7+3
 =(i 
4
 ) 
7
 ×i 
3
 =1 
7
 ×(−i)=−i.

therefore, 
i
31
=
−
i
i 
31
 =−i.

now, putting it all together, the original expression is:

i
11
+
i
16
+
i
21
+
i
26
+
i
31
=
(
−
i
)
+
1
+
i
+
(
−
1
)
+
(
−
i
)
i 
11
 +i 
16
 +i 
21
 +i 
26
 +i 
31
 =(−i)+1+i+(−1)+(−i).

let's combine like terms. the real parts are 1 and -1, and the imaginary parts are -i, i, and -i.

so, real parts: 
1
+
(
−
1
)
=
0
1+(−1)=0.

imaginary parts: 
−
i
+
i
+
(
−
i
)
=
(
−
i
+
i
)
+
(
−
i
)
=
0
+
(
−
i
)
=
−
i
−i+i+(−i)=(−i+i)+(−i)=0+(−i)=−i.

therefore, the sum is 
0
+
(
−
i
)
=
−
i
0+(−i)=−i.

wait a minute, did i do that right? let me double-check the arithmetic.

starting with the imaginary parts: -i + i + (-i).

first, -i + i = 0, and then 0 + (-i) = -i. yep, that seems correct.

and the real parts: 1 + (-1) = 0.

so, adding them together, 0 + (-i) = -i.

alright, that seems consistent.

alternatively, i could have approached this problem by recognizing that the exponents differ by 5 each time: 11, 16, 21, 26, 31.

that's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 5.

so, 
i
11
,
i
16
,
i
21
,
i
26
,
i
31
i 
11
 ,i 
16
 ,i 
21
 ,i 
26
 ,i 
31
 .

given that, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for the sum of such a sequence of powers of 
i
i.

but, since 
i
i has a period of 4, and 5 is one more than 4, perhaps there's a simpler way.

wait, 5 divided by 4 is 1 with a remainder of 1, so 
i
5
=
i
4
+
1
=
i
4
×
i
=
1
×
i
=
i
i 
5
 =i 
4+1
 =i 
4
 ×i=1×i=i.

so, each exponent increases by 5, which is equivalent to multiplying by 
i
5
=
i
i 
5
 =i.

so, each term is multiplied by 
i
i to get the next term.

wait, is that right?

let me check: 
i
16
=
i
11
+
5
=
i
11
×
i
5
=
(
−
i
)
×
i
=
−
i
2
=
−
(
−
1
)
=
1
i 
16
 =i 
11+5
 =i 
11
 ×i 
5
 =(−i)×i=−i 
2
 =−(−1)=1, which matches what i calculated earlier.

similarly, 
i
21
=
i
16
+
5
=
i
16
×
i
5
=
1
×
i
=
i
i 
21
 =i 
16+5
 =i 
16
 ×i 
5
 =1×i=i, which also matches.

and 
i
26
=
i
21
+
5
=
i
21
×
i
5
=
i
×
i
=
i
2
=
−
1
i 
26
 =i 
21+5
 =i 
21
 ×i 
5
 =i×i=i 
2
 =−1, again matching.

and 
i
31
=
i
26
+
5
=
i
26
×
i
5
=
(
−
1
)
×
i
=
−
i
i 
31
 =i 
26+5
 =i 
26
 ×i 
5
 =(−1)×i=−i, which matches as well.

so, each term is the previous term multiplied by 
i
i.

therefore, the sequence is: 
−
i
,
1
,
i
,
−
1
,
−
i
−i,1,i,−1,−i, as i found earlier.

now, to find the sum: 
−
i
+
1
+
i
−
1
−
i
−i+1+i−1−i.

wait, that seems different from before. earlier, i had 
−
i
+
1
+
i
−
1
−
i
−i+1+i−1−i.

but according to my previous calculation, it was 
(
−
i
)
+
1
+
i
+
(
−
1
)
+
(
−
i
)
(−i)+1+i+(−1)+(−i), which simplifies to 
−
i
+
1
+
i
−
1
−
i
−i+1+i−1−i, which is the same.

now, combining like terms: 
(
−
i
−
i
)
+
(
1
−
1
)
+
i
=
(
−
2
i
)
+
0
+
i
=
−
i
(−i−i)+(1−1)+i=(−2i)+0+i=−i.

wait, that's different from what i had before.

earlier, i had 
(
−
i
)
+
1
+
i
+
(
−
1
)
+
(
−
i
)
=
0
+
(
−
i
)
=
−
i
(−i)+1+i+(−1)+(−i)=0+(−i)=−i, which matches this.

so, yes, the sum is 
−
i
−i.

alternatively, maybe i can think of this as a geometric series, since each term is multiplied by 
i
i to get the next term.

a geometric series has the form 
a
+
a
r
+
a
r
2
+
a
r
3
+
⋯
+
a
r
n
−
1
a+ar+ar 
2
 +ar 
3
 +⋯+ar 
n−1
 , where 
r
r is the common ratio.

in this case, the first term 
a
=
−
i
a=−i, and the common ratio 
r
=
i
r=i, and there are 5 terms.

the sum of a geometric series is 
s
=
a
1
−
r
n
1
−
r
s=a 
1−r
1−r 
n
 
​	
 , provided 
r
≠
1
r

=1.

so, let's apply that formula.

here, 
a
=
−
i
a=−i, 
r
=
i
r=i, 
n
=
5
n=5.

so, 
s
=
−
i
×
1
−
i
5
1
−
i
s=−i× 
1−i
1−i 
5
 
​	
 .

now, 
i
5
=
i
4
+
1
=
i
4
×
i
=
1
×
i
=
i
i 
5
 =i 
4+1
 =i 
4
 ×i=1×i=i, as we established earlier.

therefore, 
s
=
−
i
×
1
−
i
1
−
i
s=−i× 
1−i
1−i
​	
 .

wait, 
1
−
i
5
=
1
−
i
1−i 
5
 =1−i, and 
1
−
i
=
1
−
i
1−i=1−i.

so, the denominator and numerator are the same, so 
1
−
i
1
−
i
=
1
1−i
1−i
​	
 =1.

therefore, 
s
=
−
i
×
1
=
−
i
s=−i×1=−i.

again, the sum is 
−
i
−i, which matches my previous calculation.

so, that seems consistent.

alternatively, maybe i can plot these complex numbers on the complex plane and see if their vector addition results in 
−
i
−i.

let's see:

- 
−
i
−i is at (0, -1)

- 
1
1 is at (1, 0)

- 
i
i is at (0, 1)

- 
−
1
−1 is at (-1, 0)

- 
−
i
−i is at (0, -1)

now, adding them vectorially:

start at the origin.

add 
−
i
−i: move to (0, -1).

add 
1
1: move to (1, -1).

add 
i
i: move to (1, 0).

add 
−
1
−1: move to (0, 0).

add 
−
i
−i: move to (0, -1).

so, the final position is (0, -1), which corresponds to 
−
i
−i.

yes, that matches again.

therefore, the sum is 
−
i
−i.

alternatively, if i consider the sum 
s
=
i
11
+
i
16
+
i
21
+
i
26
+
i
31
s=i 
11
 +i 
16
 +i 
21
 +i 
26
 +i 
31
 , and notice that the exponents are all congruent to 11 modulo 4, but since 4 is the period, perhaps there's a pattern.

wait, no, the exponents are 11, 16, 21, 26, 31, which are increasing by 5 each time.

and since 5 modulo 4 is 1, each exponent is equivalent to the previous one plus 1 modulo 4.

therefore, the exponents cycle through a pattern every 4 terms, but since there are 5 terms, there's an overlap.

wait, let's see:

exponents modulo 4:

11 mod 4 = 3

16 mod 4 = 0

21 mod 4 = 1

26 mod 4 = 2

31 mod 4 = 3

so, the exponents modulo 4 are 3, 0, 1, 2, 3.

therefore, the corresponding 
i
i powers are:

i
3
=
−
i
i 
3
 =−i

i
0
=
1
i 
0
 =1

i
1
=
i
i 
1
 =i

i
2
=
−
1
i 
2
 =−1

i
3
=
−
i
i 
3
 =−i

so, the sum is 
−
i
+
1
+
i
−
1
−
i
−i+1+i−1−i, which simplifies to 
−
i
−i.

again, consistent with previous results.

alternatively, perhaps i can think of this in terms of complex exponentials, using euler's formula: 
i
=
e
i
π
/
2
i=e 
iπ/2
 , so 
i
k
=
e
i
k
π
/
2
i 
k
 =e 
ikπ/2
 .

then, the sum becomes 
e
i
11
π
/
2
+
e
i
16
π
/
2
+
e
i
21
π
/
2
+
e
i
26
π
/
2
+
e
i
31
π
/
2
e 
i11π/2
 +e 
i16π/2
 +e 
i21π/2
 +e 
i26π/2
 +e 
i31π/2
 .

simplifying the exponents:

11π/2 = 5π + π/2

16π/2 = 8π

21π/2 = 10π + π/2

26π/2 = 13π

31π/2 = 15π + π/2

but since 
e
i
θ
e 
iθ
  is periodic with period 
2
π
2π, i can reduce these angles modulo 
2
π
2π:

5π + π/2 = 5π/2 + π/2 = 3π (since 5π/2 is 2π + π/2, so 5π/2 mod 2π is π/2, but actually, 5π/2 - 2π = π/2, so 5π/2 ≡ π/2 mod 2π.

wait, no:

wait, 5π/2 - 2π = 5π/2 - 4π/2 = π/2.

similarly, 10π/2 - 8π/2 = π.

13π/2 - 6π = 13π/2 - 12π/2 = π/2.

15π/2 - 7π = 15π/2 - 14π/2 = π/2.

wait, perhaps i'm overcomplicating this.

alternatively, since 
i
k
=
e
i
k
π
/
2
i 
k
 =e 
ikπ/2
 , and 
e
i
θ
e 
iθ
  has a period of 
2
π
2π, then 
i
k
i 
k
  has a period of 4, which matches what i found earlier.

therefore, perhaps using euler's formula isn't simplifying this any further.

so, perhaps sticking with the initial method is best.

in summary, through multiple approaches—direct computation using the 4-cycle of 
i
i, recognizing the geometric series, and vector addition on the complex plane—i consistently arrive at the sum being 
−
i
−i.

therefore, the final answer is 
−
i
−i.

**final answer**
