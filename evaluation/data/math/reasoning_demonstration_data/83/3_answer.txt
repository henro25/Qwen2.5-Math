Answer: To solve this problem, we use the Pythagorean theorem since the situation forms a right-angled triangle with the ladder as the hypotenuse.

### Given:
- The length of the ladder (hypotenuse, c) = 8.5 meters.
- The height the ladder reaches on the wall (one leg, a) = 7.5 meters.
- We need to find the distance from the wall to the base of the ladder (the other leg, b).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 = c^2
   \]
   Plugging in the known values:
   \[
   7.5^2 + b^2 = 8.5^2
   \]

2. **Calculate the squares:**
   - \(7.5^2 = 56.25\)
   - \(8.5^2 = 72.25\)

3. **Substitute these values into the equation:**
   \[
   56.25 + b^2 = 72.25
   \]

4. **Solve for \(b^2\):**
   \[
   b^2 = 72.25 - 56.25 = 16
   \]

5. **Take the square root of both sides to find \(b\):**
   \[
   b = \sqrt{16} = 4
   \]

### Final Answer:
The base of the ladder is **4 meters** from the wall.
