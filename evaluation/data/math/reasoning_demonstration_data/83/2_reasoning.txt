Reasoning: Alright, let's see. I've got this problem here: An 8.5-meter ladder is leaning against a vertical wall, and it reaches 7.5 meters up the wall. I need to find out how far the base of the ladder is from the wall. Okay, so it's a right triangle situation, right? The ladder is the hypotenuse, the wall is one leg, and the ground is the other leg.

So, I remember from school that in a right-angled triangle, the Pythagorean theorem applies. It's something like a squared plus b squared equals c squared, where c is the hypotenuse. Yeah, that sounds right. So, in this case, the ladder is 8.5 meters, which is c, and the height it reaches on the wall is 7.5 meters, which is one of the legs, let's say a. I need to find b, the distance from the wall to the base of the ladder.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. So, if I have a right triangle, one side is along the wall, one is along the ground, and the ladder connects them. So, yes, the ladder is the hypotenuse.

Okay, so plugging into the Pythagorean theorem: a squared plus b squared equals c squared. So, 7.5 squared plus b squared equals 8.5 squared.

Let me calculate 7.5 squared. 7 times 7 is 49, and 0.5 times 0.5 is 0.25, but I need to consider the cross terms. Actually, it's easier to just do 7.5 times 7.5. 7 times 7 is 49, 7 times 0.5 is 3.5, 0.5 times 7 is another 3.5, and 0.5 times 0.5 is 0.25. So, adding those up: 49 plus 3.5 is 52.5, plus another 3.5 is 56, plus 0.25 is 56.25. So, 7.5 squared is 56.25.

Similarly, 8.5 squared. 8 times 8 is 64, 8 times 0.5 is 4, another 8 times 0.5 is 4, and 0.5 times 0.5 is 0.25. So, 64 plus 4 is 68, plus another 4 is 72, plus 0.25 is 72.25. So, 8.5 squared is 72.25.

So, plugging back into the equation: 56.25 plus b squared equals 72.25. To find b squared, I subtract 56.25 from both sides: b squared equals 72.25 minus 56.25, which is 16.

So, b squared is 16, which means b is the square root of 16, which is 4.

Therefore, the base of the ladder is 4 meters away from the wall.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me think again. If the ladder is 8.5 meters and it reaches 7.5 meters up the wall, the base being only 4 meters away seems reasonable. Let me double-check the calculations to be sure.

7.5 squared is indeed 56.25, and 8.5 squared is 72.25. Subtracting gives 16, and the square root of 16 is 4. Yeah, that seems correct.

I guess that's the answer then.
