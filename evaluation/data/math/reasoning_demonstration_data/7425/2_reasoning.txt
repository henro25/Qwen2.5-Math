Reasoning: Alright, so I have this problem here: "There is only one set of five prime numbers that form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6. What is the sum of those five prime numbers?"

Okay, first things first, I need to understand what an arithmetic sequence is. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where the difference between consecutive terms is constant. In this case, the common difference is 6. So, if the first term is, say, p, then the sequence would be p, p+6, p+12, p+18, p+24.

And all of these need to be prime numbers. Primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.

So, I need to find five prime numbers in a row, each differing by 6. And it's given that there's only one such set.

Hmm, that seems tricky. Let me try to think of some small primes and see if I can spot a pattern.

Starting with the smallest primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and so on.

Let's try starting with 5: 5, 11, 17, 23, 29. Are all of these primes? 5 is prime, 11 is prime, 17 is prime, 23 is prime, and 29 is prime. So, this is one sequence.

Wait, but the problem says there's only one set. So maybe this is the set I'm looking for.

But just to be sure, I should check if there are any other sequences that fit this pattern.

Let's try starting with 7: 7, 13, 19, 25, 31. Now, 25 is not prime because it's divisible by 5. So, this sequence doesn't work.

Next, starting with 11: 11, 17, 23, 29, 35. 35 is not prime, it's divisible by 5 and 7.

Starting with 13: 13, 19, 25, 31, 37. Again, 25 is not prime.

Starting with 17: 17, 23, 29, 35, 41. 35 isn't prime.

Starting with 19: 19, 25, 31, 37, 43. 25 isn't prime.

Starting with 23: 23, 29, 35, 41, 47. 35 isn't prime.

So far, the only sequence that works is 5, 11, 17, 23, 29.

But just to make sure there aren't any larger sequences, maybe I should check a bit further.

Starting with 29: 29, 35, 41, 47, 53. 35 isn't prime.

Starting with 31: 31, 37, 43, 49, 55. 49 is 7 squared, not prime.

Starting with 37: 37, 43, 49, 55, 61. Again, 49 isn't prime.

Starting with 41: 41, 47, 53, 59, 65. 65 isn't prime.

Starting with 43: 43, 49, 55, 61, 67. 49 isn't prime.

Starting with 47: 47, 53, 59, 65, 71. 65 isn't prime.

Starting with 53: 53, 59, 65, 71, 77. 65 and 77 aren't prime.

It seems like after 5, 11, 17, 23, 29, there are no other sequences where all five numbers are prime with a common difference of 6.

Wait, but the problem says there's only one such set. So, maybe that's the one.

But just to be thorough, maybe I should check even larger primes, but I have a feeling it's going to be hard to find another set.

Let's try starting with 59: 59, 65, 71, 77, 83. 65 and 77 aren't prime.

Starting with 61: 61, 67, 73, 79, 85. 85 isn't prime.

Starting with 79: 79, 85, 91, 97, 103. 85 and 91 aren't prime.

Okay, I think I've checked a lot of primes, and the only sequence that fits is 5, 11, 17, 23, 29.

Now, to find the sum of these five primes: 5 + 11 + 17 + 23 + 29.

Let me add them up step by step.

5 + 11 = 16

16 + 17 = 33

33 + 23 = 56

56 + 29 = 85

So, the sum is 85.

But just to double-check, I'll add them all together in a different order.

11 + 29 = 40

5 + 23 = 28

28 + 17 = 45

45 + 40 = 85

Same result.

I think that's the answer.
