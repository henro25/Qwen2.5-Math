Answer: The problem asks for the sum of a unique set of five prime numbers that form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6. 

An arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6 would have the form: \( p, p+6, p+12, p+18, p+24 \), where all terms are prime.

Starting with the smallest primes and checking various sequences, the only set that satisfies this condition is:

\[
5, 11, 17, 23, 29
\]

Each number in this sequence is prime, and they are spaced 6 units apart.

To find the sum of these five primes:

\[
5 + 11 + 17 + 23 + 29 = 85
\]

Thus, the sum of these five prime numbers is **85**.
