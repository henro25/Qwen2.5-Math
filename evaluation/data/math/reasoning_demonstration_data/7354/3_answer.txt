Answer: To find the sum of the integer values of \( k \) that minimize the area of the triangle formed by the points \((1, 7)\), \((13, 16)\), and \((5, k)\), we use the shoelace formula for the area of a triangle:

\[
\text{area} = \left| \frac{1 \cdot (16 - k) + 13 \cdot (k - 7) + 5 \cdot (7 - 16)}{2} \right|
\]

simplifying inside the absolute value:

\[
1 \cdot (16 - k) = 16 - k
\]
\[
13 \cdot (k - 7) = 13k - 91
\]
\[
5 \cdot (7 - 16) = 5 \cdot (-9) = -45
\]

combining these:

\[
16 - k + 13k - 91 - 45 = 12k - 120
\]

thus, the area is:

\[
\left| \frac{12k - 120}{2} \right| = \left| 6k - 60 \right|
\]

to minimize the area, we set \( |6k - 60| \) to be as small as possible. the smallest value is zero, which occurs when:

\[
6k - 60 = 0 \implies k = 10
\]

however, if \( k = 10 \), the points are collinear, forming a degenerate triangle with zero area. since a triangle must have a positive area, we consider the next smallest values of \( k \) that make the area minimal but positive. these values are \( k = 9 \) and \( k = 11 \), both giving an area of 6.

therefore, the sum of the values of \( k \) that minimize the area is:

\[
9 + 11 = 20
\]

thus, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]
