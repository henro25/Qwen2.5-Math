Reasoning: So i have this problem here: i need to find out how many 5-digit numbers can be formed using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, each digit used exactly once, and with the condition that the digit 1 is to the left of the digit 2. also, they don't have to be next to each other.

first, i need to understand the total number of 5-digit numbers that can be formed with these digits, each used once. that's basically the number of permutations of 5 distinct digits, which is 5 factorial, or 5!.

let me calculate that: 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120. so there are 120 total possible 5-digit numbers using these digits without repetition.

now, the problem is asking for the number of these permutations where 1 is to the left of 2. that is, in the number, wherever 1 and 2 appear, 1 comes before 2.

i need to find a way to count only those permutations where 1 is before 2.

one way to approach this is to consider the positions of 1 and 2 in the number. since all digits are distinct and used exactly once, the positions of 1 and 2 are unique in each permutation.

for any pair of distinct positions in the 5-digit number, one will be to the left of the other. so, for any arrangement, either 1 is to the left of 2 or 2 is to the left of 1.

since there are no arrangements where 1 and 2 are in the same position (they are distinct digits), these two cases are mutually exclusive and cover all possibilities.

therefore, exactly half of the total permutations will have 1 to the left of 2, and the other half will have 2 to the left of 1.

so, the number of desired permutations is half of the total permutations.

therefore, the number should be 120 / 2 = 60.

wait a minute, is that correct? let me think about it again.

i know that in permutations, when dealing with specific orders between elements, often symmetry can be used to simplify the count. in this case, since there are no restrictions on the other digits, and the only condition is about the relative positions of 1 and 2, it makes sense that the number is half of the total.

but maybe i should consider another approach to confirm this.

let me try fixing the positions of 1 and 2 and see how many permutations that allows.

first, choose positions for 1 and 2. there are 5 positions, and i need to choose 2 of them for 1 and 2. the number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 5 is "5 choose 2", which is 10.

for each of these 10 choices, i can assign 1 to one position and 2 to the other. but in only one of these two assignments will 1 be to the left of 2.

so, for each pair of positions, only one arrangement satisfies the condition.

therefore, there are 10 possible pairs of positions for 1 and 2, and for each pair, only one arrangement has 1 to the left of 2.

then, for the remaining 3 digits (3, 4, and 5), they can be arranged in the remaining 3 positions in any order. the number of ways to arrange 3 distinct digits is 3! = 6.

therefore, for each of the 10 position pairs for 1 and 2, with 1 to the left of 2, there are 6 arrangements of the other digits.

so, the total number should be 10 × 6 = 60.

okay, this confirms my earlier calculation.

alternatively, i could think about the probability that in a random permutation, 1 is to the left of 2. since there are no biases, the probability should be 1/2, and hence, the number of such permutations is (1/2) × 120 = 60.

all these methods point to the same answer, which is 60.

i think this is solid. i can't see any flaws in this reasoning.

**final answer**

60
