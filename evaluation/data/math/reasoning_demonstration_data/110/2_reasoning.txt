Reasoning: 
Okay, so I've got this problem here about a water tank. It says the tank is 1/5 full, and if I add three liters, it becomes 1/4 full. I need to find out how many liters the tank can hold when it's full. Alright, let's see how to approach this.

First, I should probably define what I'm trying to find. Let's call the total capacity of the tank "C" liters. So, when the tank is full, it holds C liters of water.

Now, the problem says the tank is 1/5 full initially. That means the current amount of water in the tank is (1/5) of C, or (1/5)C liters.

Then, if I add three liters to that, the tank becomes 1/4 full. So, the new amount of water in the tank is (1/4)C liters.

So, I can set up an equation here. The initial amount plus three liters equals the new amount:

(1/5)C + 3 = (1/4)C

Now, I need to solve for C. Hmm, dealing with fractions can be a bit tricky, but I can find a common denominator or multiply both sides by something to eliminate the fractions.

Let's try multiplying both sides by 20, since 20 is a common multiple of 5 and 4.

20 * [(1/5)C + 3] = 20 * (1/4)C

This should simplify things.

Breaking it down:

20 * (1/5)C is 4C, because 20 divided by 5 is 4.

20 * 3 is 60.

On the right side, 20 * (1/4)C is 5C, because 20 divided by 4 is 5.

So now the equation is:

4C + 60 = 5C

Alright, now I can subtract 4C from both sides to get:

60 = C

So, the tank holds 60 liters when it's full.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

If the tank holds 60 liters when full, then 1/5 of that is 12 liters.

Adding 3 liters would make it 15 liters.

And 1/4 of 60 liters is indeed 15 liters.

So, that checks out.

I think that's the answer.
