Answer: Let the full capacity of the tank be $C$ liters.

Initially, the tank is $\frac{1}{5}$ full, so it contains $\frac{1}{5}C$ liters of water. After adding 3 liters, the tank is $\frac{1}{4}$ full, meaning it now contains $\frac{1}{4}C$ liters.

We can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{5}C + 3 = \frac{1}{4}C
\]
To eliminate the fractions, multiply both sides by 20:
\[
20 \times \left( \frac{1}{5}C + 3 \right) = 20 \times \frac{1}{4}C
\]
Simplifying:
\[
4C + 60 = 5C
\]
Subtract $4C$ from both sides:
\[
60 = C
\]
Thus, the tank holds 60 liters when it is full.
