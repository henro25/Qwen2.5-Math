Problem: A polynomial product of the form
\[(1 - z)^{b_1} (1 - z^2)^{b_2} (1 - z^3)^{b_3} (1 - z^4)^{b_4} (1 - z^5)^{b_5} \dotsm (1 - z^{32})^{b_{32}},\]where the $b_k$ are positive integers, has the surprising property that if we multiply it out and discard all terms involving $z$ to a power larger than 32, what is left is just $1 - 2z.$  Determine $b_{32}.$
