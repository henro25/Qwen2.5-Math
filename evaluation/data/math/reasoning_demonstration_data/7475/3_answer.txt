Answer: Given five points \((- \tfrac{3}{2}, 1)\), \((0,0)\), \((0,2)\), \((3,0)\), and \((3,2)\), we need to find the length of the minor axis of the ellipse passing through these points, with axes parallel to the coordinate axes.

the general equation of the ellipse is:

\[
\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1
\]

we start with the general conic equation \(ax^2 + cy^2 + dx + ey + f = 0\) and use the given points to form a system of equations. after solving, we find:

\[
f = 0, \quad 4c + 2e = 0, \quad 9a + 3d = 0, \quad 9a + 4c + 3d + 2e = 0
\]

from these, we derive:

\[
d = -3a, \quad e = -2c, \quad c = \frac{27}{4}a
\]

substituting these into the conic equation and completing the square, we get:

\[
(x - \tfrac{3}{2})^2 + \frac{27}{4}(y - 1)^2 = 9
\]

dividing by 9:

\[
\frac{(x - \tfrac{3}{2})^2}{9} + \frac{(y - 1)^2}{\frac{4}{3}} = 1
\]

thus, the semi-major axis \(a = 3\) and the semi-minor axis \(b = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}\). the length of the minor axis is:

\[
2b = 2 \times \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}
\]

therefore, the length of the minor axis is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}}
\]
