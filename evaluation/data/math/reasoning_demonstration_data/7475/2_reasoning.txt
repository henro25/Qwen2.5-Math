Reasoning: So i've got this problem here. it says that given any five points in the plane, with no three on the same line, there's a unique conic section passing through all five points, and in this case, it's an ellipse with axes parallel to the coordinate axes. the points are 
(
−
3
2
,
1
)
(− 
2
3
​	
 ,1), 
(
0
,
0
)
(0,0), 
(
0
,
2
)
(0,2), 
(
3
,
0
)
(3,0), and 
(
3
,
2
)
(3,2). i need to find the length of its minor axis.

first, i need to recall the general equation of an ellipse with axes parallel to the coordinate axes. i think it's something like 
(
x
−
h
)
2
a
2
+
(
y
−
k
)
2
b
2
=
1
a 
2
 
(x−h) 
2
 
​	
 + 
b 
2
 
(y−k) 
2
 
​	
 =1, where 
(
h
,
k
)
(h,k) is the center, 
a
a is the semi-major axis, and 
b
b is the semi-minor axis. since the axes are parallel to the coordinate axes, there are no 
x
y
xy terms, which simplifies things.

but given that i have five points, maybe it's easier to use the general conic equation and then use the fact that it's an ellipse with axes parallel to the coordinate axes to simplify.

the general conic equation is 
a
x
2
+
b
x
y
+
c
y
2
+
d
x
+
e
y
+
f
=
0
ax 
2
 +bxy+cy 
2
 +dx+ey+f=0. since the axes are parallel to the coordinate axes, the term with 
x
y
xy should be zero, so 
b
=
0
b=0. also, for an ellipse, the condition is that 
b
2
−
4
a
c
<
0
b 
2
 −4ac<0, which in this case simplifies to just 
−
4
a
c
<
0
−4ac<0, since 
b
=
0
b=0. so, 
a
c
>
0
ac>0.

so, the equation simplifies to 
a
x
2
+
c
y
2
+
d
x
+
e
y
+
f
=
0
ax 
2
 +cy 
2
 +dx+ey+f=0.

now, i can plug in the five points into this equation to get a system of equations and solve for the coefficients 
a
a, 
c
c, 
d
d, 
e
e, and 
f
f.

let me list the points again:

1. 
(
−
3
2
,
1
)
(− 
2
3
​	
 ,1)

2. 
(
0

(0,0)

3. 
(

4. 
(

(3,0)

5. 
(

plugging in each point:

1. for 
(

(−

a

 ) 
2
 +c(1)

simplify:

a

e
+
f
=

a(

so, 
9

f
=

 d+e+f=0  … (1)

2. for

(0,0):

a

+
f

a(0) 
2

so, 
f
=

f=0  … (2)

3. for 
(

(0,2):

a
(

c

+
e
(
2

+
f
=
0
a(0) 
2
 +c(2) 
2
 +d(0)+e(2)+f=0

simplify:

4
c
+
2
e
+
f
=
0
4c+2e+f=0  … (3)

but from (2), 
f
=
0
f=0, so:

4
c
+
2
e
=
0
4c+2e=0  … (3a)

4. for 
(
3
,
0
)
(3,0):

a
(
3

2
+
c
(
0

2

d

e
(
0
)
+
f
=
0
a(3) 
2
 +c(0) 
2
 +d(3)+e(0)+f=0

simplify:

9
a
+
3
d
+
f
=
0
9a+3d+f=0

again, 
f
=
0
f=0, so:

9
a
+
3
d
=
0
9a+3d=0  … (4)

5. for 
(
3
,
2
)
(3,2):

a
(

2
+
c
(

e
(

+
f
=

a(3)

 +c(2)

 +d(3)+e(2)+f=0

simplify:

a
+
4
c
+
3
d
+
2
e
+
f
=
0
9a+4c+3d+2e+f=0

with 
f
=
0
f=0, it becomes:

9
a
+
4
c
+
3
d
+
2
e
=
0
9a+4c+3d+2e=0  … (5)

now, i have the following system of equations:

(1): 
9

e
=

(5): 
9
a
+

c

3
d
+
2
e
=
0
9a+4c+3d+2e=0

and from (2), 
f
=
0
f=0

i need to solve for 
a
a, 
c
c, 
d
d, and 
e
e.

first, from equation (4):

9
a
+
3
d
=
0
9a+3d=0

i can solve for 
d
d in terms of 
a
a:

3
d
=
−
9
a
3d=−9a

so, 
d
=
−
3
a
d=−3a  … (6)

now, from equation (3a):

4
c
+
2
e
=
0
4c+2e=0

i can solve for 
e
e in terms of 
c
c:

2
e
=
−
4
c
2e=−4c

so, 
e
=
−

c
e=−2c  … (7)

now, substitute 
d
=

d=−3a and 
e
=

simplify:

4

​	
 a+c+

combine like terms:

=

 a−c=0

so, 
c

now, substitute

substitute:

simplify each term:

−

9a+27a−9a−27a=0

=

0+0=0

hmm, that's interesting. it simplifies to 
0
=
0
0=0, which means this equation doesn't provide new information. so, i need to use another equation to find the relationship between the variables.

but i already used equations (1), (3a), (4), and (5), and substituted to find relationships between 
a
a, 
c
c, 
d
d, and 
e
e. it seems like i have one remaining equation, which is equation (1), but i already used that.

wait, maybe i need to express everything in terms of one variable.

from equation (8), 
c
=
27
4
a
c= 
4
27
​	
 a

from equation (6), 
d
=
−

a
d=−3a

from equation (7), 
e

c
=

a
e=−2c=−2× 
4
27
​	
 a=− 
2
27
​	
 a

and 
f
=
0
f=0

so, all variables are expressed in terms of 
a
a. but i need to find the actual values.

perhaps i can choose a value for 
a
a, but in the context of the ellipse equation, i need to ensure that the equation represents an ellipse.

alternatively, i can substitute these expressions back into the general conic equation and see if it matches the standard form of an ellipse.

wait a minute. maybe it's easier to find the center of the ellipse first.

in the standard form, 
(
x
−
h
)
2
a
2
+
(
y
−
k
)
2
b
2
=

a 
2
 
(x−h) 
2
 
​	
 + 
b 
2
 
(y−k) 
2
 
​	
 =1, the center is 
(
h
,
k
)
(h,k).

maybe i can find 
h
h and 
k
k first.

alternatively, since the general conic equation is 
a
x
2
+
c
y
2
+
d
x
+
e
y
+
f
=
0
ax 
2
 +cy 
2
 +dx+ey+f=0, and i have expressions for 
c
c, 
d
d, 
e
e, and 
f
f in terms of 
a
a, i can plug these back into the equation and try to rearrange it into the standard ellipse form.

let's try that.

the general equation is:

a
x
2
+
c
y
2
+
d
x
+
e
y
+
f
=
0
ax

 +dx+ey+f=0

substitute 
c
=
27
4
a
c=

27
​	
 a, 
d
=
−
3
a
d=−3a, 
e
=
−
27

a
e=−

​	
 a, and 
f

ax

4
27
​	
 ay 
2
 −3ax− 
2
27
​	
 ay=0

i can factor out 
a
a:

a
(
x

y
2
−
3
x
−
27

)
=
0
a(x 
2
 + 
4
27
​	
 y 
2
 −3x− 
2
27
​	
 y)=0

since 
a
a is not zero (otherwise, it wouldn't be an ellipse), i can divide both sides by 
a
a:

x
2
+
27
4
y
2
−

now, i need to complete the squares for 
x

first, group the

let me complete the square for

similarly, for the

now, substitute these back into the equation:

​	
 ) 
2
 +

​	
 (y−1)

now, to get it into the standard ellipse form, divide both sides by 9:

simplify the denominators:

simplify

​	
 :

36
27
=

​

so, the equation is:

this is now in the standard form of an ellipse:

where

h=

a 
2
 =9, and 
b
2
=

 .

so, 
a

a=3 and 
b

​	
 
​	
 =

​

 =

​	
 
​	
 .

since 
a
>
b
a>b, 
a
a is the semi-major axis, and 
b
b is the semi-minor axis.

therefore, the length of the minor axis is

b

wait, but the problem says it's an ellipse with axes parallel to the coordinate axes, and i've got the minor axis length as 
4
3
3
3
4 
3
​	
 
​	
 . is that correct?

let me double-check my calculations to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

first, in completing the square for the 
y
y terms:

27
4
y
2
−
27
2
y
4
27
​	
 y 
2
 − 
2
27
​	
 y

factor out 
27
4
4
27
​	
 :

27
4
(
y
2
−
2
y
)
4
27
​	
 (y 
2
 −2y)

complete the square inside the parentheses:

y
2
−
2
y
=
(
y
−
1
)
2
−
1
y 
2
 −2y=(y−1) 
2
 −1

so, 
27
4
(
(
y
−
1
)
2
−
1
)
=
27
4
(
y
−
1
)
2
−
27
4
4
27
​	
 ((y−1) 
2
 −1)= 
4
27
​	
 (y−1) 
2
 − 
4
27
​	
 

that seems correct.

then, plugging back in:

(
x
−
3
2
)
2
−
9
4
+
27
4
(
y
−
1
)
2
−
27
4
=
0
(x− 
2
3
​	
 ) 
2
 − 
4
9
​	
 + 
4
27
​	
 (y−1) 
2
 − 
4
27
​	
 =0

combine constants:

−
9
4
−
27
4
=
−
36
4
=
−
9
− 
4
9
​	
 − 
4
27
​	
 =− 
4
36
​	
 =−9

wait a second, earlier i wrote 
−
36
4
− 
4
36
​	
 , which is indeed 
−
9
−9, but in the next step, i have:

(
x
−
3
2
)
2
+
27
4
(
y
−
1
)
2
−
9
=
0
(x− 
2
3
​	
 ) 
2
 + 
4
27
​	
 (y−1) 
2
 −9=0

then, moving the constant to the other side:

(
x
−
3
2
)
2
+
27
4
(
y
−
1
)
2
=
9
(x− 
2
3
​	
 ) 
2
 + 
4
27
​	
 (y−1) 
2
 =9

dividing both sides by 9:

(
x
−
3
2
)
2
9
+
27
4
(
y
−
1
)
2
9
=
1
9
(x− 
2
3
​	
 ) 
2
 
​	
 + 
9
4
27
​	
 (y−1) 
2
 
​	
 =1

simplify the second term:

27
4
(
y
−
1
)
2
9
=
27
4
×
9
(
y
−
1
)
2
=
27
36
(
y
−
1
)
2
=
3
4
(
y
−
1
)
2
9
4
27
​	
 (y−1) 
2
 
​	
 = 
4×9
27
​	
 (y−1) 
2
 = 
36
27
​	
 (y−1) 
2
 = 
4
3
​	
 (y−1) 
2
 

wait, earlier i had 
27
4
/
9
=
27
36
=
3
4
4
27
​	
 /9= 
36
27
​	
 = 
4
3
​	
 , but in my earlier step, i wrote 
27
4
/
9
=
3
4
4
27
​	
 /9= 
4
3
​	
 , which is correct.

so, the equation is:

(
x
−
3
2
)
2
9
+
(
y
−
1
)
2
4
3
=
1
9
(x− 
2
3
​	
 ) 
2
 
​	
 + 
3
4
​	
 
(y−1) 
2
 
​	
 =1

wait, no. 
27
4
/
9
=
27
36
=
3
4
4
27
​	
 /9= 
36
27
​	
 = 
4
3
​	
 , so it should be:

(
x
−
3
2
)
2
9
+
(
y
−
1
)
2
4
3
=
1
9
(x− 
2
3
​	
 ) 
2
 
​	
 + 
3
4
​	
 
(y−1) 
2
 
​	
 =1

wait, but 
3
4
4
3
​	
  is the coefficient, so actually:

(
x
−
3
2
)
2
9
+
(
y
−
1
)
2
4
3
=
1
9
(x− 
2
3
​	
 ) 
2
 
​	
 + 
3
4
​	
 
(y−1) 
2
 
​	
 =1

yes, that's correct.

so, 
a
2
=
9
a 
2
 =9, hence 
a
=
3
a=3, and 
b
2
=
4
3
b 
2
 = 
3
4
​	
 , hence 
b
=
2
3
=
2
3
3
b= 
3
​	
 
2
​	
 = 
3
2 
3
​	
 
​	
 .

thus, the minor axis length is 
2
b
=
4
3
3
2b= 
3
4 
3
​	
 
​	
 .

but i recall that in an ellipse, the major axis is the longer one, and the minor axis is the shorter one. in this case, since 
a
>
b
a>b, the minor axis is indeed 
2
b
=
4
3
3
2b= 
3
4 
3
​	
 
​	
 .

however, to ensure that this is correct, maybe i should verify by plugging in one of the points into the standard ellipse equation.

let's take point 
(
0
,
0
)
(0,0):

(
0
−
3
2
)
2
9
+
(
0
−
1
)
2
4
3
=
(
9
4
)
9
+
1
4
3
=
1
4
+
3
4
=
1
9
(0− 
2
3
​	
 ) 
2
 
​	
 + 
3
4
​	
 
(0−1) 
2
 
​	
 = 
9
( 
4
9
​	
 )
​	
 + 
3
4
​	
 
1
​	
 = 
4
1
​	
 + 
4
3
​	
 =1

that checks out.

let's check another point, say 
(
3
,
0
)
(3,0):

(
3
−
3
2
)
2
9
+
(
0
−
1
)
2
4
3
=
(
3
2
)
2
9
+
1
4
3
=
9
4
9
+
3
4
=
1
4
+
3
4
=
1
9
(3− 
2
3
​	
 ) 
2
 
​	
 + 
3
4
​	
 
(0−1) 
2
 
​	
 = 
9
( 
2
3
​	
 ) 
2
 
​	
 + 
3
4
​	
 
1
​	
 = 
9
4
9
​	
 
​	
 + 
4
3
​	
 = 
4
1
​	
 + 
4
3
​	
 =1

good.

one more point, 
(
−
3
2
,
1
)
(− 
2
3
​	
 ,1):

(
−
3
2
−
3
2
)
2
9
+
(
1
−
1
)
2
4
3
=
(
−
3
)
2
9
+
0
=
9
9
+
0
=
1
9
(− 
2
3
​	
 − 
2
3
​	
 ) 
2
 
​	
 + 
3
4
​	
 
(1−1) 
2
 
​	
 = 
9
(−3) 
2
 
​	
 +0= 
9
9
​	
 +0=1

perfect.

so, it seems my calculations are correct, and the minor axis length is indeed 
4
3
3
3
4 
3
​	
 
​	
 .
