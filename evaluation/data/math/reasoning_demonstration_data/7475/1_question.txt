Problem: A famous theorem states that given any five points in the plane, with no three on the same line, there is a unique conic section (ellipse, hyperbola, or parabola) which passes through all five points. The conic section passing through the five points \[(-\tfrac32, 1), \; (0,0), \;(0,2),\; (3,0),\; (3,2).\]is an ellipse whose axes are parallel to the coordinate axes. Find the length of its minor axis.
