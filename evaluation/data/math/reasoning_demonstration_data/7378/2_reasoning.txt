Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: find the largest integer 
n
n for which 
1
2
n
12 
n
  evenly divides 
20
!
20!. okay, first things first, i need to understand what this is asking. so, 
20
!
20! means 20 factorial, which is the product of all positive integers from 1 to 20. and i need to find the highest power of 12 that divides evenly into this big number.

hmm, i remember that when we're dealing with factorials and divisibility, prime factorization is usually the way to go. so, maybe i should start by breaking down 12 into its prime factors. let's see, 12 is equal to 
2
2
×
3
2 
2
 ×3. got it. so, 
1
2
n
=
(
2
2
×
3
)
n
=
2
2
n
×
3
n
12 
n
 =(2 
2
 ×3) 
n
 =2 
2n
 ×3 
n
 .

now, if 
1
2
n
12 
n
  divides 
20
!
20!, that means 
20
!
20! must have at least 
2
2
n
2 
2n
  and 
3
n
3 
n
  in its prime factorization. so, i need to find the highest power of 2 and 3 in 
20
!
20!, and then see what's the largest 
n
n that satisfies both conditions.

alright, to find the exponent of a prime 
p
p in 
n
!
n!, i recall there's a formula for that. it's called legendre's formula, i think. it says that the exponent of 
p
p in 
n
!
n! is equal to 
∑
k
=
1
∞
⌊
n
p
k
⌋
∑ 
k=1
∞
​	
 ⌊ 
p 
k
 
n
​	
 ⌋, where 
⌊
x
⌋
⌊x⌋ is the floor function, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to 
x
x.

so, let's apply that to find the exponent of 2 in 
20
!
20!. that would be:

⌊
20
2
⌋
+
⌊
20
4
⌋
+
⌊
20
8
⌋
+
⌊
20
16
⌋
+
⌊
20
32
⌋
+
…
⌊ 
2
20
​	
 ⌋+⌊ 
4
20
​	
 ⌋+⌊ 
8
20
​	
 ⌋+⌊ 
16
20
​	
 ⌋+⌊ 
32
20
​	
 ⌋+…

calculating each term:

⌊
20
2
⌋
=
10
⌊ 
2
20
​	
 ⌋=10

⌊
20
4
⌋
=
5
⌊ 
4
20
​	
 ⌋=5

⌊
20
8
⌋
=
2
⌊ 
8
20
​	
 ⌋=2

⌊
20
16
⌋
=
1
⌊ 
16
20
​	
 ⌋=1

⌊
20
32
⌋
=
0
⌊ 
32
20
​	
 ⌋=0 (since 32 is greater than 20, and floor of anything less than 1 is 0)

so, adding them up: 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 18. therefore, the exponent of 2 in 
20
!
20! is 18.

now, for the exponent of 3 in 
20
!
20!:

⌊
20
3
⌋
+
⌊
20
9
⌋
+
⌊
20
27
⌋
+
…
⌊ 
3
20
​	
 ⌋+⌊ 
9
20
​	
 ⌋+⌊ 
27
20
​	
 ⌋+…

calculating each term:

⌊
20
3
⌋
=
6
⌊ 
3
20
​	
 ⌋=6

⌊
20
9
⌋
=
2
⌊ 
9
20
​	
 ⌋=2

⌊
20
27
⌋
=
0
⌊ 
27
20
​	
 ⌋=0 (since 27 is greater than 20)

so, adding them up: 6 + 2 = 8. therefore, the exponent of 3 in 
20
!
20! is 8.

now, going back to 
1
2
n
=
2
2
n
×
3
n
12 
n
 =2 
2n
 ×3 
n
 . for 
1
2
n
12 
n
  to divide 
20
!
20!, we need 
2
n
≤
18
2n≤18 and 
n
≤
8
n≤8.

so, solving for 
n
n:

from 
2
n
≤
18
2n≤18, we get 
n
≤
9
n≤9.

from 
n
≤
8
n≤8, we get 
n
≤
8
n≤8.

therefore, the largest integer 
n
n that satisfies both conditions is 
n
=
8
n=8.

wait a minute, but just to be sure, maybe i should check if 
1
2
8
12 
8
  indeed divides 
20
!
20! without leaving a remainder.

let's see, 
1
2
8
=
(
2
2
×
3
)
8
=
2
16
×
3
8
12 
8
 =(2 
2
 ×3) 
8
 =2 
16
 ×3 
8
 .

we already found that 
20
!
20! has 
2
18
2 
18
  and 
3
8
3 
8
 , so yes, 
2
16
2 
16
  is less than 
2
18
2 
18
 , and 
3
8
3 
8
  is equal to 
3
8
3 
8
 , so it should divide evenly.

but just to be thorough, maybe i should check if 
n
=
9
n=9 is possible. for 
n
=
9
n=9, 
1
2
9
=
2
18
×
3
9
12 
9
 =2 
18
 ×3 
9
 .

now, 
20
!
20! has 
2
18
2 
18
  and 
3
8
3 
8
 , so 
3
9
3 
9
  would require an extra 3 that isn't present in 
20
!
20!. therefore, 
n
=
9
n=9 is not possible.

therefore, the largest integer 
n
n is indeed 8.

**final answer**

8
