Reasoning: Alright, so I've got this problem here. Cameron writes down the smallest positive multiple of 20 that's a perfect square, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that's a perfect cube, and all the multiples of 20 between them. And I need to find out how many integers are in Cameron's list.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. There are three parts to Cameron's list:

1. The smallest positive multiple of 20 that's a perfect square.

2. The smallest positive multiple of 20 that's a perfect cube.

3. All the multiples of 20 between these two numbers.

And then, I need to count how many integers are in that list.

Okay, let's tackle the first part: finding the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square.

So, a multiple of 20 is any number that 20 divides into without leaving a remainder. A perfect square is a number that's the square of an integer, like 1, 4, 9, 16, etc.

I need to find the smallest number that is both a multiple of 20 and a perfect square.

Maybe I should start by factoring 20 to see its prime factors.

20 can be factored into 2 * 2 * 5, or 2^2 * 5^1.

For a number to be a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization need to be even numbers.

So, looking at 20's factorization: 2^2 * 5^1. The exponent of 2 is already even (2), but the exponent of 5 is odd (1). So, to make it a perfect square, I need to multiply by another 5 to make the exponent of 5 even.

So, 20 * 5 = 100.

100 is 10^2, which is a perfect square. So, 100 is the smallest positive multiple of 20 that's a perfect square.

Wait, is there a smaller multiple of 20 that's a perfect square? Let's check.

20 * 1 = 20, which is not a perfect square.

20 * 2 = 40, not a perfect square.

20 * 3 = 60, not a perfect square.

20 * 4 = 80, not a perfect square.

20 * 5 = 100, which is a perfect square.

Yes, so 100 is indeed the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square.

Now, the second part: the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube.

Again, starting with 20's prime factorization: 2^2 * 5^1.

For a number to be a perfect cube, all exponents in its prime factorization need to be multiples of 3.

So, looking at 20: 2^2 and 5^1.

To make 2^2 into a multiple of 3, I need to have 2^3, which means multiplying by 2 once more.

And for 5^1, I need to make it 5^3, so I need to multiply by 5^2, which is 25.

So, the smallest multiple would be 20 * 2 * 25 = 20 * 50 = 1000.

Is 1000 a perfect cube?

Yes, because 1000 is 10^3.

Let me check smaller multiples of 20 to confirm there isn't a smaller one.

20 * 1 = 20, not a perfect cube.

20 * 2 = 40, not a perfect cube.

20 * 3 = 60, not a perfect cube.

20 * 4 = 80, not a perfect cube.

20 * 5 = 100, not a perfect cube.

20 * 6 = 120, not a perfect cube.

...

Up to 20 * 50 = 1000, which is a perfect cube.

So, 1000 is the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube.

Now, Cameron writes down these two numbers: 100 and 1000.

And then he writes down all the multiples of 20 between them.

So, I need to list all multiples of 20 starting from 100 up to 1000, inclusive.

And then count how many numbers are in that list.

So, starting at 100 and ending at 1000, stepping by 20 each time.

To find the number of terms in this sequence, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence:

Number of terms = ((Last term - First term) / Common difference) + 1

Here, Last term = 1000, First term = 100, Common difference = 20.

So, ((1000 - 100) / 20) + 1 = (900 / 20) + 1 = 45 + 1 = 46.

So, there are 46 multiples of 20 between 100 and 1000, inclusive.

But wait, Cameron writes down the smallest multiple that's a perfect square (100), the smallest multiple that's a perfect cube (1000), and all the multiples of 20 between them.

So, is 100 included in the "between them" part?

Wait, the problem says "the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube, and all the multiples of 20 between them."

So, I think both 100 and 1000 are included in the list.

So, the total number should include both endpoints.

As I calculated, there are 46 multiples of 20 from 100 to 1000 inclusive.

But I just want to double-check.

Let me list out some of them to see.

100, 120, 140, ..., 1000.

The difference between consecutive terms is 20.

So, the number of terms is ((1000 - 100)/20) + 1 = (900/20) + 1 = 45 + 1 = 46.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the answer should be 46 integers in Cameron's list.

But let me think again.

Is there any possibility that 100 and 1000 are the same number? No, 100 is less than 1000.

Also, are there any multiples of 20 between 100 and 1000 that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes? Well, 100 is a perfect square, 1000 is a perfect cube, but I don't think there are any others in between that are both.

But since Cameron is only including the smallest multiple that's a perfect square and the smallest multiple that's a perfect cube, and all multiples of 20 between them, I don't think I need to worry about overlaps beyond that.

So, I think 46 is the correct answer.
