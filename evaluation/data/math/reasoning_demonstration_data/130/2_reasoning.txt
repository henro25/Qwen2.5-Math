Reasoning: So i have this problem here: calculate (3 * 5! + 15 * 4!) divided by 6!. hmm, factorials. i remember that n! means the product of all positive integers up to n. so, 5! is 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1, and so on.

first, i need to compute 5! and 4!, then multiply them by 3 and 15 respectively, add those two results together, and finally divide by 6!.

let me start by calculating the factorials:

5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24

6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

now, plug these back into the expression:

(3 * 120 + 15 * 24) / 720

first, calculate 3 times 120:

3 * 120 = 360

then, 15 times 24:

15 * 24 = 360

add those two results:

360 + 360 = 720

now, divide by 6! which is 720:

720 / 720 = 1

so, the answer should be 1.

wait a minute, is there a smarter way to do this without calculating all the factorials? maybe there's a way to simplify the expression before plugging in the numbers.

let me look at the original expression again:

(3 * 5! + 15 * 4!) / 6!

i notice that 6! is 6 * 5!, so maybe i can factor out 5! or 4! from the numerator.

let me try factoring out 4! from both terms in the numerator since 5! is 5 * 4!.

so, 5! = 5 * 4!, and 4! is just 4!.

substituting that in:

(3 * 5 * 4! + 15 * 4!) / 6!

factor out 4!:

4! * (3 * 5 + 15) / 6!

simplify inside the parentheses:

3 * 5 = 15, so 15 + 15 = 30

so, it's 4! * 30 / 6!

now, 6! is 6 * 5 * 4!, so:

4! * 30 / (6 * 5 * 4!) = 30 / (6 * 5) = 30 / 30 = 1

same result, but this way seems quicker.

alternatively, maybe i can express everything in terms of 6!.

wait, perhaps i can write 5! in terms of 6!.

since 6! = 6 * 5!, then 5! = 6! / 6.

similarly, 4! = 5! / 5 = (6! / 6) / 5 = 6! / (6 * 5) = 6! / 30.

so, substitute back into the original expression:

3 * (6! / 6) + 15 * (6! / 30) all over 6!.

let me compute each term:

3 * (6! / 6) = (3/6) * 6! = 0.5 * 6!

15 * (6! / 30) = (15/30) * 6! = 0.5 * 6!

so, the numerator is 0.5 * 6! + 0.5 * 6! = 1 * 6!

then, numerator is 6!, denominator is 6!, so 6! / 6! = 1.

again, same answer.

it seems no matter which way i approach it, the answer is 1.

i guess that's the simplest way to confirm it.

alternatively, maybe i can think about the factorials in terms of permutations.

but that might be overcomplicating it.

let me see if i can generalize this.

suppose i have (a * n! + b * (n-1)!) / (n+1)! )

is there a general formula for this?

maybe, but in this specific case, it's not necessary.

alternatively, perhaps i can write everything in terms of 4!.

we have 5! = 5 * 4!, 6! = 6 * 5 * 4! = 30 * 4!.

so, plugging back into the expression:

(3 * 5 * 4! + 15 * 4!) / (30 * 4!) = (15 * 4! + 15 * 4!) / 30 * 4! = (30 * 4!) / 30 * 4! = 1

same result.

i think it's clear now that the answer is 1.
