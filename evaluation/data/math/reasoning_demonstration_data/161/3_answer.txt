Answer: Given an acute triangle \(abc\) with points \(p\) and \(q\) as the feet of the perpendiculars from \(c\) to \(\overline{ab}\) and from \(b\) to \(\overline{ac}\), respectively, and line \(pq\) intersecting the circumcircle of \(\triangle abc\) at points \(x\) and \(y\), we are provided with the lengths \(xp = 10\), \(pq = 25\), and \(qy = 15\). we need to find \(ab \cdot ac\) in the form \(m\sqrt{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are positive integers, and \(n\) is not divisible by the square of any prime.

first, we calculate the total length of \(xy\):
\[
xy = xp + pq + qy = 10 + 25 + 15 = 50
\]

next, we use the power of a point theorem for points \(p\) and \(q\) with respect to the circumcircle of \(\triangle abc\):
\[
\text{power of } p = px \cdot py = 10 \cdot 40 = 400
\]
\[
\text{power of } q = qx \cdot qy = 35 \cdot 15 = 525
\]

we then consider the ratio of these powers:
\[
\frac{\text{power of } p}{\text{power of } q} = \frac{400}{525} = \frac{16}{21}
\]

assuming \(ab = c\) and \(ac = b\), we use the relationship:
\[
ab \cdot ac = 2r \cdot bc \cdot \cos a
\]

however, a more straightforward approach is to consider the product of the powers of points \(p\) and \(q\):
\[
ab \cdot ac = \sqrt{\text{power of } p \cdot \text{power of } q} = \sqrt{400 \cdot 525} = \sqrt{210000} = 100\sqrt{21}
\]

thus, the value of \(ab \cdot ac\) is:
\[
\boxed{100\sqrt{21}}
\]

the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{100\sqrt{21}}
\]
