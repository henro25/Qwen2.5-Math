Answer: Mark borrows $10 from emily with a simple interest rate of 15% per day. we need to find the least integer number of days after which mark will have to pay back at least twice the amount he borrowed, which is $20.

the formula for the total amount to be paid back with simple interest is:

\[ a = p(1 + rt) \]

where:
- \( p = 10 \) dollars (principal amount)
- \( r = 0.15 \) (daily interest rate)
- \( t \) is the number of days

we need:

\[ 10(1 + 0.15t) \geq 20 \]

first, divide both sides by 10:

\[ 1 + 0.15t \geq 2 \]

then, subtract 1 from both sides:

\[ 0.15t \geq 1 \]

now, divide both sides by 0.15:

\[ t \geq \frac{1}{0.15} \]

calculating \( \frac{1}{0.15} \):

\[ \frac{1}{0.15} = \frac{100}{15} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.\overline{6} \]

since \( t \) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number, which is 7.

to verify:
- for \( t = 6 \):

\[ a = 10(1 + 0.15 \times 6) = 10(1 + 0.9) = 10 \times 1.9 = 19 \]

- for \( t = 7 \):

\[ a = 10(1 + 0.15 \times 7) = 10(1 + 1.05) = 10 \times 2.05 = 20.5 \]

thus, the least integer number of days is:

\boxed{7}
