Reasoning: Let's see here. so, mark borrows $10 from emily, and there's a simple interest rate of 15% every day. i need to find out the least number of days after which mark has to pay back at least twice the amount he borrowed. so, twice $10 is $20. that means i need to find the smallest number of days where the total amount to be paid back is at least $20.

first, i need to understand what simple interest means. simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, which is the initial amount borrowed. the formula for simple interest is:

i
=
p
×
r
×
t
i=p×r×t
where:

- 
i
i is the interest

- 
p
p is the principal amount

- 
r
r is the rate of interest per period

- 
t
t is the time in the number of periods

in this case, the principal 
p
p is $10, the rate 
r
r is 15% per day, and 
t
t is the number of days.

so, the interest each day would be:

i
=
10
×
0.15
×
t
i=10×0.15×t
wait, actually, since the rate is 15% per day, and it's simple interest, the total amount to be paid back after 
t
t days would be:

a
=
p
+
i
=
p
+
(
p
×
r
×
t
)
=
p
(
1
+
r
t
)
a=p+i=p+(p×r×t)=p(1+rt)
so,

a
=
10
(
1
+
0.15
t
)
a=10(1+0.15t)
we need this amount to be at least twice the borrowed amount, which is $20.

so,

10
(
1
+
0.15
t
)
≥
20
10(1+0.15t)≥20
now, i can solve for 
t
t:

first, divide both sides by 10:

1
+
0.15
t
≥
2
1+0.15t≥2
then, subtract 1 from both sides:

0.15
t
≥
1
0.15t≥1
now, divide both sides by 0.15:

t
≥
1
0.15
t≥ 
0.15

so, 
t
t needs to be at least approximately 6.666 days.

but since the number of days has to be an integer, and we can't have a fraction of a day in this context, we need to round up to the next whole number. therefore, the least integer number of days is 7.

wait a minute, but let's check if 6 days would suffice.

if 
t
=
6
t=6:

a
=
10
(
1
+
0.15
×
6
)
=
10
(
1
+
0.9
)
=
10
×
1.9
=
19
a=10(1+0.15×6)=10(1+0.9)=10×1.9=19
that's $19, which is less than $20.

if 
t
=
7
t=7:

a
=
10
(
1
+
0.15
×
7
)
=
10
(
1
+
1.05
)
=
10
×
2.05
=
20.5
a=10(1+0.15×7)=10(1+1.05)=10×2.05=20.5
that's $20.5, which is more than $20.

so, 7 days is the smallest integer number of days where the amount to be paid back is at least twice the borrowed amount.

but let's double-check if i'm using the correct formula for simple interest in this context. simple interest is indeed 
i
=
p
r
t
i=prt, and the total amount is 
a
=
p
+
i
=
p
(
1
+
r
t
)
a=p+i=p(1+rt).

given that, my calculations seem correct.

alternatively, maybe i should consider compound interest, but the problem specifically says "simple interest."

just to be thorough, if it were compound interest, the formula would be different:

a
=
p
(
1
+
r
)
t
a=p(1+r) 
t
 
but since it's simple interest, i should stick with the earlier formula.

therefore, the answer should be 7 days.

**final answer**
