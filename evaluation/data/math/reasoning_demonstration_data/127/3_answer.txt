Answer: Given that each triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle and the hypotenuse of one triangle is the longer leg of an adjacent triangle, we need to find the length of the longer leg of the smallest triangle when the hypotenuse of the largest triangle is 8 cm.

1. **side ratios in 30-60-90 triangles:**
   - shorter leg: \( s \)
   - longer leg: \( l = s \sqrt{3} \)
   - hypotenuse: \( h = 2s \)

2. **relationship between triangles:**
   - the hypotenuse of one triangle is the longer leg of the next triangle.
   - therefore, \( h_n = l_{n+1} \)

3. **calculations for each triangle:**
   - largest triangle (triangle 1):
     - hypotenuse \( h_1 = 8 \) cm
     - longer leg \( l_1 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 8 = 4\sqrt{3} \) cm
   - second triangle (triangle 2):
     - hypotenuse \( h_2 = l_1 = 4\sqrt{3} \) cm
     - longer leg \( l_2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 4\sqrt{3} = 6 \) cm
   - third triangle (triangle 3):
     - hypotenuse \( h_3 = l_2 = 6 \) cm
     - longer leg \( l_3 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 6 = 3\sqrt{3} \) cm
   - fourth triangle (triangle 4):
     - hypotenuse \( h_4 = l_3 = 3\sqrt{3} \) cm
     - longer leg \( l_4 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 3\sqrt{3} = \frac{9}{2} \) cm

thus, the length of the longer leg of the smallest triangle is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{9}{2}}
\]
