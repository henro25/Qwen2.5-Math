Reasoning: So i have this problem about 30-60-90 triangles, and it seems a bit tricky at first, but i think i can figure it out step by step. let me start by recalling what i know about 30-60-90 triangles.

in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2, where 1 is the length of the shorter leg, √3 is the longer leg, and 2 is the hypotenuse. so, if i know one side, i can find the others using these ratios.

the problem says that each triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle, and the hypotenuse of one triangle is the longer leg of an adjacent triangle. there are multiple triangles connected in this way, and the hypotenuse of the largest triangle is 8 centimeters. i need to find the length of the longer leg of the smallest triangle.

first, i should visualize this setup. there are several triangles connected such that the hypotenuse of one is the longer leg of the next one. since it's a 30-60-90 triangle, the angles are fixed, and the side ratios are consistent.

let me try to understand the relationship between the triangles. if the hypotenuse of one triangle is the longer leg of the next, then i can express the sides of each triangle in terms of the sides of the adjacent triangle.

let's denote the hypotenuse of the largest triangle as h1 = 8 cm. since it's the hypotenuse of a 30-60-90 triangle, the longer leg l1 of this triangle would be (√3)/2 times the hypotenuse. so, l1 = (√3)/2 * h1 = (√3)/2 * 8 = 4√3 cm.

now, this longer leg l1 is the hypotenuse of the next smaller triangle. so, for the second triangle, h2 = l1 = 4√3 cm. then, the longer leg of this second triangle would be l2 = (√3)/2 * h2 = (√3)/2 * 4√3 = ( (√3)*4√3 ) / 2 = (4 * 3) / 2 = 12/2 = 6 cm.

wait a minute, that's interesting. the longer leg of the second triangle is 6 cm, which is a nice whole number.

now, this longer leg l2 = 6 cm is the hypotenuse of the third triangle. so, h3 = l2 = 6 cm. then, the longer leg of the third triangle would be l3 = (√3)/2 * h3 = (√3)/2 * 6 = 3√3 cm.

continuing this pattern, the longer leg l3 = 3√3 cm is the hypotenuse of the fourth triangle. so, h4 = l3 = 3√3 cm. then, l4 = (√3)/2 * h4 = (√3)/2 * 3√3 = ( (√3)*3√3 ) / 2 = (3 * 3) / 2 = 9/2 cm.

wait, 9/2 cm is 4.5 cm. that's a fractional value, which makes sense since the problem asks for a common fraction.

is there another triangle beyond this? the asymptote code suggests there are five triangles, but in my calculations, i have four triangles so far.

let me check the asymptote code again. it says:

for(int i = 0; i < 5; ++i){ draw(o--((2/sqrt(3))^i)*dir(30*i)); }

and

for(int g = 0; g < 4; ++g){ draw( ((2/sqrt(3))^g)*dir(30*g)-- ((2/sqrt(3))^(g+1))*dir(30*g+30)); }

and labels the hypotenuse of the largest triangle as 8 cm.

so, there are five triangles in total, meaning that i need to go one more step beyond what i did earlier.

let me continue my pattern.

the longer leg l4 = 9/2 cm is the hypotenuse of the fifth triangle. so, h5 = l4 = 9/2 cm. then, the longer leg of the fifth triangle would be l5 = (√3)/2 * h5 = (√3)/2 * (9/2) = (9√3)/4 cm.

but wait, the problem is asking for the longer leg of the smallest triangle, which would be the fifth one in this sequence. so, l5 = (9√3)/4 cm.

but the problem wants the answer as a common fraction, and (9√3)/4 involves a radical. maybe i need to rationalize it or express it differently.

alternatively, perhaps i made a mistake in assuming there are five triangles. let me see the asymptote code again. it says for(int i=0; i<5; ++i), which would draw five segments, but perhaps it's drawing four triangles.

looking at the labels, there are four 30-degree labels, suggesting four connections, so maybe there are four triangles.

wait, the asymptote code has for(int i=0; i<5; ++i), which would loop five times, but the second loop is for(int g=0; g<4; ++g), which loops four times.

moreover, the label for the hypotenuse of the largest triangle is given as 8 cm, and it's labeled at o--(16/9)*dir(120), which might be a clue, but perhaps i don't need to get into the asymptote code details.

maybe i should stick to the initial approach.

alternatively, perhaps there is a better way to approach this problem using geometric series or ratios.

let me think differently.

given that each hypotenuse is the longer leg of the next triangle, and all are 30-60-90 triangles, there must be a constant ratio between the sides of consecutive triangles.

let me denote the hypotenuse of the largest triangle as h1 = 8 cm.

then, the longer leg of the first triangle is l1 = (√3)/2 * h1.

this l1 is the hypotenuse of the second triangle, so h2 = l1 = (√3)/2 * h1.

then, the longer leg of the second triangle is l2 = (√3)/2 * h2 = (√3)/2 * (√3)/2 * h1 = (3/4) * h1.

similarly, the hypotenuse of the third triangle is h3 = l2 = (3/4) * h1.

the longer leg of the third triangle is l3 = (√3)/2 * h3 = (√3)/2 * (3/4) * h1 = (3√3)/8 * h1.

continuing this pattern, the hypotenuse of the fourth triangle is h4 = l3 = (3√3)/8 * h1.

the longer leg of the fourth triangle is l4 = (√3)/2 * h4 = (√3)/2 * (3√3)/8 * h1 = (3*3)/(16) * h1 = 9/16 * h1.

wait, this seems different from what i had earlier. earlier, i had l4 = 9/2 cm, assuming h1 = 8 cm.

but according to this, l4 = 9/16 * h1.

if h1 = 8 cm, then l4 = 9/16 * 8 = 9/2 cm, which matches my previous calculation.

so, the longer leg of the fourth triangle is 9/2 cm.

but if there are five triangles, then there should be a fifth one.

let me continue.

h5 = l4 = 9/2 cm.

then, l5 = (√3)/2 * h5 = (√3)/2 * 9/2 = 9√3 / 4 cm.

but the problem asks for the longer leg of the smallest triangle, which would be l5 = 9√3 / 4 cm.

however, the problem wants the answer as a common fraction, and 9√3 / 4 has a radical in the numerator.

maybe i need to rationalize it or express it differently.

alternatively, perhaps i miscounted the number of triangles.

let me check again.

given that the asymptote code has loops from i=0 to i<5 and g=0 to g<4, it might be that there are four triangles, not five.

if that's the case, then the smallest triangle would be the fourth one with l4 = 9/2 cm.

but that doesn't involve a radical, which seems simpler.

alternatively, maybe i need to consider that the smallest triangle is the fifth one, and accept that the answer involves a radical.

but the problem says "express your answer as a common fraction," which might suggest that the radical should be rationalized or eliminated somehow.

wait, perhaps there is a mistake in assuming that the longer leg is always √3/2 times the hypotenuse.

in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2, where the side opposite 30 degrees is the shorter leg, opposite 60 degrees is the longer leg, and opposite 90 degrees is the hypotenuse.

so, shorter leg : longer leg : hypotenuse = 1 : √3 : 2.

therefore, longer leg = shorter leg * √3, and hypotenuse = shorter leg * 2.

alternatively, hypotenuse = longer leg * 2 / √3.

wait, let me verify that.

given hypotenuse h, longer leg l = (√3)/2 * h.

yes, that's correct.

alternatively, shorter leg s = h / 2.

and l = s * √3 = (√3/2) * h.

so, that seems consistent.

maybe i should consider the ratio between consecutive triangles.

each hypotenuse is the longer leg of the next triangle.

so, h_n = l_{n+1}.

but l_{n+1} = (√3)/2 * h_{n+1}.

wait, no, h_n = l_{n+1}.

so, l_{n+1} = h_n.

but in a 30-60-90 triangle, l_{n+1} = (√3)/2 * h_{n+1}.

wait, i'm getting confused here.

let me try to define the relationship properly.

let me denote:

- for triangle n:

- hypotenuse: h_n

- longer leg: l_n

- shorter leg: s_n

given that, in a 30-60-90 triangle:

- l_n = (√3)/2 * h_n

- s_n = 1/2 * h_n

also, the hypotenuse of triangle n is the longer leg of triangle n+1.

therefore, h_n = l_{n+1}.

from the earlier formula, l_{n+1} = (√3)/2 * h_{n+1}.

but h_n = l_{n+1}, so h_n = (√3)/2 * h_{n+1}.

therefore, h_{n+1} = (2/√3) * h_n.

wait, so each hypotenuse is (2/√3) times the hypotenuse of the next triangle.

this suggests that as we go to smaller triangles, the hypotenuse is multiplied by √3/2.

wait, no. let's see:

if h_n = (√3)/2 * h_{n+1}, then h_{n+1} = (2/√3) * h_n.

so, each subsequent triangle's hypotenuse is (2/√3) times the previous hypotenuse.

wait, that can't be right because (2/√3) is greater than 1, meaning the hypotenuse would be increasing, but we are moving to smaller triangles.

i think i have the relationship backwards.

given that h_n = l_{n+1}, and l_{n+1} = (√3)/2 * h_{n+1}, then:

h_n = (√3)/2 * h_{n+1}

therefore, h_{n+1} = (2/√3) * h_n.

yes, that's correct.

so, each subsequent triangle has a hypotenuse that is (2/√3) times the previous hypotenuse.

therefore, the hypotenuse sequence is: h1, h2 = (2/√3) * h1, h3 = (2/√3)^2 * h1, and so on.

similarly, the longer leg of each triangle is l_n = (√3)/2 * h_n.

so, l_n = (√3)/2 * (2/√3)^{n-1} * h1.

wait, maybe i should think of it in terms of the number of triangles.

let me assume there are k triangles.

given that, the hypotenuse of the largest triangle is h1 = 8 cm.

then, h2 = (2/√3) * h1

h3 = (2/√3)^2 * h1

...

hk = (2/√3)^{k-1} * h1

similarly, the longer leg of the smallest triangle, which is the k-th triangle, would be l_k = (√3)/2 * h_k.

therefore, l_k = (√3)/2 * (2/√3)^{k-1} * h1

simplify this expression:

l_k = (√3)/2 * (2/√3)^{k-1} * 8

let me compute this for k=4, as i initially thought there are four triangles.

then, l4 = (√3)/2 * (2/√3)^3 * 8

first, compute (2/√3)^3 = 8 / (3√3)

so, l4 = (√3)/2 * (8 / (3√3)) * 8

simplify:

(√3)/2 * 8 / (3√3) = (√3 * 8) / (2 * 3√3) = (8√3) / (6√3) = 8/6 = 4/3

then, 4/3 * 8 = 32/3 cm

wait, that can't be right because earlier i got l4 = 9/2 cm.

there must be a mistake in this approach.

alternatively, perhaps the number of triangles is different.

let me try with k=5.

then, l5 = (√3)/2 * (2/√3)^4 * 8

(2/√3)^4 = 16 / (9 * 3^{0.5})

wait, (2/√3)^4 = 16 / (9 * 3^{0.5})

but 3^{0.5} is √3, so 16 / (9√3)

then, l5 = (√3)/2 * 16 / (9√3) * 8

simplify:

(√3)/2 * 16 / (9√3) = (16 * √3) / (18√3) ) = 16/18 = 8/9

then, 8/9 * 8 = 64/9 cm

but earlier, i had l5 = 9√3 /4 cm, which is approximately 4.0 cm, whereas 64/9 cm is approximately 7.1 cm.

these are different, so i must have made a mistake somewhere.

perhaps i should approach this differently.

let me consider the ratios between the hypotenuses and longer legs.

each hypotenuse is (2/√3) times the hypotenuse of the next triangle.

so, h_{n+1} = (2/√3) * h_n

therefore, the hypotenuse decreases by a factor of √3/2 each time.

wait, no.

given h_{n+1} = (2/√3) * h_n, then each hypotenuse is larger than the previous one by a factor of 2/√3, which is greater than 1, meaning the hypotenuse is increasing, which contradicts the idea of smaller triangles.

therefore, perhaps the relationship should be h_{n+1} = h_n / (2/√3) = √3/2 * h_n

that makes more sense because then each hypotenuse is smaller than the previous one by a factor of √3/2, which is less than 1.

so, h_{n+1} = (√3/2) * h_n

therefore, h2 = (√3/2) * h1

h3 = (√3/2)^2 * h1

h4 = (√3/2)^3 * h1

and so on.

similarly, the longer leg of each triangle is l_n = (√3)/2 * h_n

so, l_n = (√3)/2 * (√3/2)^{n-1} * h1

simplify this expression:

l_n = (√3)/2 * (√3/2)^{n-1} * h1 = (√3/2)^n * h1

now, if there are k triangles, the smallest triangle is the k-th one, so l_k = (√3/2)^k * h1

given that h1 = 8 cm, l_k = (√3/2)^k * 8 cm

now, i need to determine the value of k, which is the number of triangles.

looking back at the asymptote code, it seems there are five triangles, but i'm not entirely sure.

alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that each time we go to a smaller triangle, the hypotenuse is multiplied by √3/2.

therefore, after n steps, the hypotenuse is h_n = h1 * (√3/2)^{n-1}

and the longer leg is l_n = (√3)/2 * h_n = (√3)/2 * h1 * (√3/2)^{n-1} = (√3/2)^n * h1

so, for the smallest triangle, if there are k triangles, then l_k = (√3/2)^k * h1

now, perhaps i can find a pattern or a general formula for l_k.

alternatively, maybe i can find a direct relationship between the hypotenuse of the largest triangle and the longer leg of the smallest triangle.

let me consider that the longer leg of the smallest triangle is related to the hypotenuse of the largest one through a geometric sequence.

the ratio between consecutive hypotenuses is √3/2, as established.

therefore, the hypotenuse sequence is: h1, h2 = h1 * (√3/2), h3 = h2 * (√3/2) = h1 * (√3/2)^2, and so on.

similarly, the longer legs are: l1 = (√3)/2 * h1, l2 = (√3)/2 * h2 = (√3)/2 * h1 * (√3/2), and so on.

therefore, l_k = (√3)/2 * h_{k-1}, since the longer leg of the k-th triangle is the hypotenuse of the (k-1)-th triangle.

wait, no. each hypotenuse is the longer leg of the next triangle.

so, h_{n} = l_{n+1}

therefore, l_{n+1} = h_n

but l_{n+1} = (√3)/2 * h_{n+1}

therefore, h_n = (√3)/2 * h_{n+1}

so, h_{n+1} = (2/√3) * h_n

wait, this is the same as before.

i think i'm going in circles here.

perhaps a better approach is to consider the ratio between the longer leg of one triangle and the longer leg of the next smallest triangle.

given that h_n = l_{n+1}, and h_n = (√3)/2 * h_{n}

wait, that doesn't make sense.

alternatively, perhaps i can set up an equation based on the number of triangles.

suppose there are n triangles, and i need to find the longer leg of the smallest one.

given h1 = 8 cm

h2 = (√3/2) * h1

h3 = (√3/2)^2 * h1

...

hn = (√3/2)^{n-1} * h1

similarly, l_n = (√3)/2 * h_n = (√3)/2 * (√3/2)^{n-1} * h1 = (√3/2)^n * h1

so, l_n = (√3/2)^n * 8

now, i need to find l_k, where k is the number of triangles.

but i need to determine k.

looking back at the asymptote code, it has loops from i=0 to i<5 and g=0 to g<4, which might suggest four triangles, but i'm not entirely sure.

alternatively, perhaps the number of triangles is not important, and i can express the longer leg of the smallest triangle in terms of the largest one without knowing k.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the infinite sequence, but that doesn't make sense in this context.

maybe i need to assume a specific number of triangles.

given that there are asymptote commands for 5 iterations, perhaps there are four triangles, as the loop from i=0 to i<5 would draw five lines, corresponding to four triangles.

alternatively, perhaps there are five triangles.

this is confusing.

let me try to consider that there are four triangles.

then, l4 = (√3/2)^4 * 8

calculate (√3/2)^4:

(√3)^4 / 2^4 = (9) / 16

therefore, l4 = 9/16 * 8 = 9/2 cm

so, the longer leg of the fourth triangle is 9/2 cm.

alternatively, if there are five triangles, then l5 = (√3/2)^5 * 8

(√3)^5 / 2^5 = (9 * √3) / 32

therefore, l5 = (9√3)/32 * 8 = (9√3)/4 cm

but the problem asks for a common fraction, and (9√3)/4 is still a fraction with a radical.

perhaps i need to rationalize the denominator.

(9√3)/4 is already simplified, but maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of radicals in the numerator.

alternatively, perhaps i need to consider that the longer leg of the smallest triangle is related to the hypotenuse of the largest one through a geometric progression.

given that each hypotenuse is multiplied by √3/2 to get the next hypotenuse, and the longer leg is (√3)/2 times the hypotenuse.

therefore, the longer leg of the smallest triangle is h1 * (√3/2)^n, where n is the number of steps.

but without knowing n, i can't proceed.

alternatively, perhaps i can express the longer leg of the smallest triangle directly in terms of the largest hypotenuse.

wait, perhaps there's a better way.

let me consider the relationship between the hypotenuse and the longer leg across multiple triangles.

given that h_n = l_{n+1}, and l_n = (√3)/2 * h_n.

therefore, l_n = (√3)/2 * l_{n+1}

this seems like a recursive relationship.

so, l_{n+1} = (2/√3) * l_n

therefore, each longer leg is (2/√3) times the longer leg of the previous triangle.

given that, starting from the largest triangle with hypotenuse h1 = 8 cm, its longer leg is l1 = (√3)/2 * 8 = 4√3 cm.

then, l2 = (2/√3) * l1 = (2/√3) * 4√3 = 8 cm

wait, that's interesting. l2 = 8 cm, which is the same as h1.

then, l3 = (2/√3) * l2 = (2/√3) * 8 = 16/√3 cm

then, l4 = (2/√3) * l3 = (2/√3) * (16/√3) = 32 / 3 cm

and so on.

but this seems to be increasing the lengths, which contradicts the idea that the triangles are getting smaller.

i must have made a mistake in the relationship.

let me try again.

given that h_n = l_{n+1}, and l_n = (√3)/2 * h_n

therefore, l_n = (√3)/2 * l_{n+1}

therefore, l_{n+1} = (2/√3) * l_n

wait, this suggests that each longer leg is larger than the previous one, which doesn't make sense for smaller triangles.

i think i have the relationships wrong.

let me re-examine.

in a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg, and the longer leg is √3 times the shorter leg.

alternatively, the longer leg is (√3)/2 times the hypotenuse.

now, the hypotenuse of one triangle is the longer leg of the next triangle.

therefore, h_n = l_{n+1}

and l_n = (√3)/2 * h_n

therefore, l_n = (√3)/2 * l_{n+1}

therefore, l_{n+1} = (2/√3) * l_n

this again suggests that each longer leg is larger than the previous one, which is contradictory.

i must be missing something.

perhaps the way the triangles are connected is different.

alternatively, maybe the hypotenuse of one triangle is the longer leg of the adjacent triangle, but not necessarily the next smaller one.

wait, looking back at the asymptote code, it seems that the triangles are arranged in a specific pattern, possibly forming a spiral or something similar.

given that, perhaps the relationship is more complex than i initially thought.

alternatively, maybe there's a geometric series that i can sum up to find the length of the longer leg of the smallest triangle.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the similarity ratios between the triangles.

given that the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is constant.

given that, if the hypotenuse of one triangle is the longer leg of the next, then the ratio of similarity is the ratio of the longer leg to the hypotenuse of the next triangle.

wait, perhaps i can denote the ratio as r = (longer leg of one triangle) / (hypotenuse of the next triangle)

given that, and knowing the side ratios of 30-60-90 triangles, i can find r.

in a 30-60-90 triangle, longer leg / hypotenuse = (√3)/2

therefore, r = (√3)/2

therefore, the ratio of similarity between consecutive triangles is r = √3/2

therefore, the hypotenuse of each triangle is r times the hypotenuse of the previous one.

given that, h1 = 8 cm

h2 = r * h1 = (√3)/2 * 8 = 4√3 cm

h3 = r * h2 = (√3)/2 * 4√3 = ( (√3)*4√3 ) / 2 = (4*3)/2 = 12/2 = 6 cm

h4 = r * h3 = (√3)/2 * 6 = 3√3 cm

h5 = r * h4 = (√3)/2 * 3√3 = (3*3)/2 = 9/2 cm

so, the hypotenuses are: 8 cm, 4√3 cm, 6 cm, 3√3 cm, 9/2 cm

similarly, the longer legs would be:

l1 = (√3)/2 * h1 = (√3)/2 * 8 = 4√3 cm

l2 = (√3)/2 * h2 = (√3)/2 * 4√3 = (4*3)/2 = 6 cm

l3 = (√3)/2 * h3 = (√3)/2 * 6 = 3√3 cm

l4 = (√3)/2 * h4 = (√3)/2 * 3√3 = (3*3)/2 = 9/2 cm

l5 = (√3)/2 * h5 = (√3)/2 * 9/2 = (9√3)/4 cm

therefore, if there are five triangles, the longer leg of the smallest one is (9√3)/4 cm.

however, the problem asks for a common fraction, and (9√3)/4 is already a fraction, though it includes a radical.

perhaps the answer is acceptable in this form.

alternatively, maybe i need to rationalize the denominator.

(9√3)/4 is already simplified, but if i rationalize it, it would still have a radical in the numerator.

alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming the number of triangles.

if there are four triangles, then the longer leg of the smallest one would be l4 = 9/2 cm.

but that doesn't involve a radical, which seems simpler.

given that, and considering that the asymptote code might suggest four triangles, perhaps the answer is 9/2 cm.

but to be sure, perhaps i should consider that the number of triangles is five, and accept that the answer involves a radical.

alternatively, maybe there's a different approach to find the length directly.

let me consider that each time, the hypotenuse is multiplied by √3/2 to get the hypotenuse of the next triangle.

therefore, the hypotenuse sequence is: h1, h2 = h1 * (√3/2), h3 = h1 * (√3/2)^2, and so on.

similarly, the longer leg of each triangle is l_n = (√3)/2 * h_n = (√3)/2 * h1 * (√3/2)^{n-1} = (√3/2)^n * h1

therefore, for the smallest triangle, which is the k-th one, l_k = (√3/2)^k * h1

given that, and h1 = 8 cm, l_k = (√3/2)^k * 8 cm

now, to find k, perhaps i can relate it to the asymptote code.

the asymptote code has for(int i=0; i<5; ++i), which likely draws five lines, suggesting four triangles.

therefore, k = 4.

therefore, l4 = (√3/2)^4 * 8 = ( (√3)^4 ) / 2^4 * 8 = 9 / 16 * 8 = 9/2 cm

therefore, the longer leg of the smallest triangle is 9/2 cm.

this seems consistent with my earlier calculation.

therefore, the answer is 9/2 cm.
