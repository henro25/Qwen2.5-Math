Reasoning: So i'm looking at this problem here: "what is the value of 
x
+
y
x+y if the sequence 
2
,
6
,
10
,
…
,
x
,
y
,
26
2,6,10,…,x,y,26 is an arithmetic sequence?"

first off, i need to remember what an arithmetic sequence is. it's a sequence where the difference between consecutive terms is constant. that means if i take any two terms next to each other, their difference should be the same.

let me look at the given sequence: 2, 6, 10, …, x, y, 26.

i can see the first three terms: 2, 6, 10. let me find the common difference here.

difference between 6 and 2 is 6 - 2 = 4.

difference between 10 and 6 is 10 - 6 = 4.

so, the common difference 
d
d is 4.

now, the sequence is arithmetic with 
d
=
4
d=4.

the sequence is: 2, 6, 10, …, x, y, 26.

i need to find x and y such that the sequence remains arithmetic, and then find 
x
+
y
x+y.

let me think about how many terms are there in this sequence.

given terms: 2, 6, 10, …, x, y, 26.

so, including 2 and 26, there are at least 6 terms: positions 1 to 6.

but actually, it's not specified how many terms there are before x.

wait, the sequence is 2, 6, 10, …, x, y, 26.

so, the first three terms are given, and then there are some terms missing, represented by the ellipsis, and then x, y, and 26.

but to make it simpler, maybe i can assume that after 10, the next term is x, then y, then 26.

but that might not be correct because there could be more terms in between.

wait, but the problem writes "2, 6, 10, …, x, y, 26", so the only terms specified are 2, 6, 10, then some terms, then x, y, and 26.

but to find x and y, i might need to know their positions in the sequence.

alternatively, maybe i can consider that after 10, the next terms are x, y, and 26, with a common difference of 4.

wait, but if d = 4, then after 10, the next term should be 14, then 18, then 22, then 26.

but here it's given as x, y, 26.

so, if x and y are the terms before 26, and d = 4, then y should be 26 - 4 = 22, and x should be 22 - 4 = 18.

therefore, x = 18 and y = 22.

so, x + y = 18 + 22 = 40.

but wait, the problem says "the sequence 2, 6, 10, …, x, y, 26 is an arithmetic sequence."

is there a possibility that there are more terms between 10 and x?

if there are more terms, then my assumption might be wrong.

maybe i need to consider that the sequence could have more terms before x.

let me try a different approach.

in an arithmetic sequence, the nth term is given by:

a
n
=
a
1
+
(
n
−
1
)
⋅
d
a 
n
​
 =a 
1
​
 +(n−1)⋅d

where 
a
1
a 
1
​
  is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the term number.

given that, let's find out the position of 26 in the sequence.

suppose 26 is the kth term.

then,

a
k
=
2
+
(
k
−
1
)
⋅
4
=
26
a 
k
​
 =2+(k−1)⋅4=26

so,

2
+
4
(
k
−
1
)
=
26
2+4(k−1)=26

subtract 2 from both sides:

4
(
k
−
1
)
=
24
4(k−1)=24

divide both sides by 4:

k
−
1
=
6
k−1=6

so, 
k
=
7
k=7

therefore, 26 is the 7th term of the sequence.

now, the sequence is: term 1: 2, term 2: 6, term 3: 10, …, term n: x, term m: y, term 7: 26.

but i need to know the positions of x and y.

assuming that x and y are the 5th and 6th terms, respectively.

let me check that.

term 4: 14

term 5: 18 (x)

term 6: 22 (y)

term 7: 26

yes, that matches.

so, x = 18, y = 22, and x + y = 40.

but to be thorough, maybe i should check if there could be more terms between 10 and x.

suppose there are additional terms between 10 and x.

let's say the sequence is 2, 6, 10, a, x, y, 26.

then, a would be 14, x would be 18, y would be 22, same as before.

alternatively, if there are more terms, like 2, 6, 10, a, b, x, y, 26.

then a = 14, b = 18, x = 22, y = 26.

but then y would be 26, which contradicts the sequence given.

wait, in this case, y would be 22 and the next term would be 26, which matches.

but the problem says x, y, 26 are the last three terms.

so, in this case, x = 22, y = 26.

but that can't be, because then y = 26, but 26 is already the last term.

wait, maybe i'm getting confused.

let me re-express the sequence with term numbers.

term 1: 2

term 2: 6

term 3: 10

term 4: 14

term 5: 18

term 6: 22

term 7: 26

so, if x and y are the 5th and 6th terms, then x = 18, y = 22.

alternatively, if x and y are the 6th and 7th terms, then x = 22, y = 26.

but the problem says "…, x, y, 26", meaning that 26 is after y.

so, if y is 26, that doesn't make sense because 26 is the last term.

therefore, y must be before 26.

so, y is the term before 26.

thus, y = 22, x = 18.

therefore, x + y = 18 + 22 = 40.

i think that's the answer.

alternatively, maybe the sequence has more terms before x.

for example:

term 1: 2

term 2: 6

term 3: 10

term 4: a

term 5: x

term 6: y

term 7: 26

then, a would be 14, x = 18, y = 22.

same as before.

so, x + y = 40.

alternatively, if there are more terms:

term 1: 2

term 2: 6

term 3: 10

term 4: a

term 5: b

term 6: x

term 7: y

term 8: 26

then, a = 14, b = 18, x = 22, y = 26.

but again, y = 26, which is the last term.

so, in this case, y is 26, but the problem says y is before 26.

therefore, the only logical positions are x = 18, y = 22.

therefore, x + y = 40.

i think that's the answer.

**final answer**

40
