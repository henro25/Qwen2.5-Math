Reasoning: So i've got this probability problem here, and i need to figure out the probability that when rolling four 12-sided dice, the number of dice showing a two-digit number is equal to the number of dice showing a one-digit number. the dice have numbers from 1 to 12.

first, i need to understand what constitutes a one-digit number and what constitutes a two-digit number on these dice. since the numbers go from 1 to 12, the one-digit numbers are 1 through 9, and the two-digit numbers are 10 through 12. so, there are 9 one-digit numbers and 3 two-digit numbers on each die.

now, i have four dice, and i need to find the probability that the number of dice showing two-digit numbers is equal to the number showing one-digit numbers. since there are four dice, and i need equal numbers, that means i need two dice showing one-digit numbers and two showing two-digit numbers.

so, the problem reduces to finding the probability that exactly two out of four dice show one-digit numbers, and the other two show two-digit numbers.

to find this probability, i can use the binomial probability formula, which is:

p
(
k
)
=
(
n
k
)
p
k
(
1
−
p
)
n
−
k
p(k)=( 
k
n
​
 )p 
k
 (1−p) 
n−k
 
where:

- 
n
n is the total number of trials (dice rolled),

- 
k
k is the number of successful trials (dice showing one-digit numbers),

- 
p
p is the probability of success on a single trial.

in this case:

- 
n
=
4
n=4,

- 
k
=
2
k=2,

- 
p
=
p= probability that a single die shows a one-digit number.

first, i need to find 
p
p, the probability that a single die shows a one-digit number. since there are 9 one-digit numbers out of 12 possible, 
p
=
9
12
=
3
4
p= 
12
9
​
 = 
4
3
​
 .

similarly, the probability of a die showing a two-digit number is 
1
−
p
=
1
4
1−p= 
4
1
​
 .

now, plugging into the binomial formula:

p
(
2
)
=
(
4
2
)
(
3
4
)

(
1

)

p(2)=( 
2
4
​
 )( 
4
3
​
 ) 
2
 ( 
4
1
​
 ) 
2
 
first, calculate the binomial coefficient:

(

)
=

⋅
(
4
−
2
)
!

(

4
​
 )= 
2!⋅(4−2)!
4!
​
 = 
2⋅2
24
​
 =6
then, calculate 
(
3
4
)
2
=
9
16
( 
4
3
​
 ) 
2
 = 
16

​
 

and 
(

4
)
2
=
1
16
( 
4
1
​
 ) 
2
 = 
16

​
 

now, multiply them all together:

p

=

256

​
 =

​
 
simplify the fraction:

256
=

128
256

​
 =

​
 
wait a minute, is that the final answer? let me double-check.

alternatively, i can think of it as:

total number of possible outcomes when rolling four dice: 
1
2
4
12 
4
 

number of favorable outcomes: choosing 2 dice to show one-digit numbers and the other 2 to show two-digit numbers.

first, choose which 2 out of 4 dice will show one-digit numbers: 
(
4
2
)
=
6
( 
2
4
​
 )=6

each of these 2 dice has 9 possible one-digit numbers, so 
9
2
9 
2
 

each of the other 2 dice has 3 possible two-digit numbers, so 
3
2
3 
2
 

therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is:

(
4
2
)
×
9
2
×
3
2
=
6
×
81
×
9
=

729
=
4374
( 
2
4
​
 )×9 
2
 ×3 
2
 =6×81×9=6×729=4374
wait, that doesn't seem right. let me recalculate that.

actually, 
9
2
=
81
9 
2
 =81 and 
3
2
=
9
3 
2
 =9, so 
81
×
9
=
729
81×9=729, then 
6
×
729
=
4374
6×729=4374

total possible outcomes: 
1
2
4
=
20736
12 
4
 =20736

so, the probability is 
4374
20736
20736
4374
​
 

simplify this fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 6:

4374
÷
6
20736
÷
6
=
729
3456
20736÷6
4374÷6
​
 = 
3456
729
​
 
divide numerator and denominator by 9:

729
÷
9
3456
÷
9
=
81
384
3456÷9
729÷9
​
 = 
384
81
​
 
divide numerator and denominator by 9 again:

81
÷
9
384
÷
9
=
9
42.666...
384÷9
81÷9
​
 = 
42.666...
9
​
 
wait, that doesn't make sense. 384 divided by 9 is 42.666..., which is not an integer, but i must have made a mistake in simplifying.

let me try dividing numerator and denominator by 81:

81
÷
81
384
÷
81
=
1
4.74...
384÷81
81÷81
​
 = 
4.74...
1
​
 
that's not helpful either. maybe i should factor both numerator and denominator to find the greatest common divisor (gcd).

factor 81: 
81
=
3
4
81=3 
4
 

factor 384: 
384
=
2
7
×
3
384=2 
7
 ×3

so, the gcd is 3.

divide numerator and denominator by 3:

81
÷
3
384
÷
3
=
27
128
384÷3
81÷3
​
 = 
128
27
​
 
ah, so the simplified fraction is 
27
128
128
27
​
 , which matches what i got earlier using the binomial probability formula.

therefore, the probability is 
27
128
128
27
​
 .

i think that's the correct answer.

**final answer**
