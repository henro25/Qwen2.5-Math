Reasoning: So i've got this problem: find all real values of 
a
a for which the polynomial 
x
4
+
a
x
3
−
x
2
+
a
x
+
1
=
0
x 
4
 +ax 
3
 −x 
2
 +ax+1=0 has at least one real root. hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.

first off, i need to find the values of 
a
a such that there's at least one real solution to the equation. that means the polynomial crosses the x-axis at least once. since it's a quartic polynomial, it can have up to four real roots, but i just need at least one.

maybe i can think about the behavior of the polynomial. for large positive or negative 
x
x, the 
x
4
x 
4
  term will dominate, so the polynomial will go to positive infinity as 
x
x approaches both positive and negative infinity. that means the graph will have a "u" shape on both ends.

if the polynomial has at least one real root, that implies that it dips below the x-axis somewhere since it starts and ends at positive infinity. so, there must be some minimum point below the x-axis.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the intermediate value theorem. if the polynomial takes on both positive and negative values, then it must cross the x-axis at least once. but given that it goes to positive infinity on both ends, maybe i need to check if there's a point where the polynomial is negative.

wait, actually, since the leading coefficient is positive and the degree is even, the ends both go to positive infinity, as i thought. so, for the polynomial to have real roots, it must attain negative values somewhere.

alternatively, maybe i can try to find the minimum value of the polynomial and see when that minimum is less than or equal to zero.

let me try to find the critical points by taking the derivative.

the derivative of 
p
(
x
)
=
x
4
+
a
x
3
−
x
2
+
a
x
+
1
p(x)=x 
4
 +ax 
3
 −x 
2
 +ax+1 is:

p
′
(
x
)
=
4
x
3
+
3
a
x
2
−
2
x
+
a
p 
′
 (x)=4x 
3
 +3ax 
2
 −2x+a

setting this equal to zero to find critical points:

4
x
3
+
3
a
x
2
−
2
x
+
a
=
0
4x 
3
 +3ax 
2
 −2x+a=0

hmm, that seems complicated to solve for general 
a
a. maybe there's a better approach.

let me consider the polynomial 
p
(
x
)
=
x
4
+
a
x
3
−
x
2
+
a
x
+
1
p(x)=x 
4
 +ax 
3
 −x 
2
 +ax+1. maybe i can factor this polynomial somehow.

looking at it, i notice that the polynomial is symmetric in a way, but not palindromic since the coefficients don't read the same forwards and backwards.

wait a second, maybe i can group terms:

p
(
x
)
=
x
4
+
a
x
3
+
a
x
+
(
−
x
2
+
1
)
p(x)=x 
4
 +ax 
3
 +ax+(−x 
2
 +1)

hmm, not sure if that helps.

alternatively, perhaps i can factor by grouping:

let me try grouping 
x
4
+
a
x
3
x 
4
 +ax 
3
  and 
−
x
2
+
a
x
+
1
−x 
2
 +ax+1:

x
3
(
x
+
a
)
−
(
x
2
−
a
x
−
1
)
x 
3
 (x+a)−(x 
2
 −ax−1)

still not obvious.

maybe i can try to factor the polynomial as a product of two quadratics:

assume 
p
(
x
)
=
(
x
2
+
b
x
+
c
)
(
x
2
+
d
x
+
e
)
p(x)=(x 
2
 +bx+c)(x 
2
 +dx+e)

expanding this, we get:

x
4
+
(
b
+
d
)
x
3
+
(
c
+
e
+
b
d
)
x
2
+
(
b
e
+
c
d
)
x
+
c
e
x 
4
 +(b+d)x 
3
 +(c+e+bd)x 
2
 +(be+cd)x+ce

set this equal to the original polynomial:

x
4
+
a
x
3
−
x
2
+
a
x
+
1
x 
4
 +ax 
3
 −x 
2
 +ax+1

so, matching coefficients:

1. 
b
+
d
=
a
b+d=a

2. 
c
+
e
+
b
d
=
−
1
c+e+bd=−1

3. 
b
e
+
c
d
=
a
be+cd=a

4. 
c
e
=
1
ce=1

from equation 4, 
c
e
=
1
ce=1. so, possible pairs for 
c
c and 
e
e are 
(
1
,
1
)
(1,1) or 
(
−
1
,
−
1
)
(−1,−1).

let's try 
c
=
1
c=1 and 
e
=
1
e=1:

then equation 1: 
b
+
d
=
a
b+d=a

equation 2: 
1
+
1
+
b
d
=
−
1
1+1+bd=−1 => 
b
d
=
−
3
bd=−3

equation 3: 
b
⋅
1
+
1
⋅
d
=
a
b⋅1+1⋅d=a => 
b
+
d
=
a
b+d=a

so, from equation 1 and equation 3, we have the same equation: 
b
+
d
=
a
b+d=a, and 
b
d
=
−
3
bd=−3.

so, 
b
b and 
d
d are roots of the quadratic equation 
t
2
−
a
t
−
3
=
0
t 
2
 −at−3=0. the discriminant is 
a
2
+
12
a 
2
 +12, which is always positive, so real roots exist.

therefore, the factorization is possible with 
c
=
e
=
1
c=e=1.

so, 
p
(
x
)
=
(
x
2
+
b
x
+
1
)
(
x
2
+
d
x
+
1
)
p(x)=(x 
2
 +bx+1)(x 
2
 +dx+1), where 
b
+
d
=
a
b+d=a and 
b
d
=
−
3
bd=−3.

now, to find when 
p
(
x
)
=
0
p(x)=0, at least one of the quadratic factors must be zero.

so, either 
x
2
+
b
x
+
1
=
0
x 
2
 +bx+1=0 or 
x
2
+
d
x
+
1
=
0
x 
2
 +dx+1=0.

each quadratic equation has real roots if its discriminant is non-negative.

for 
x
2
+
b
x
+
1
=
0
x 
2
 +bx+1=0, discriminant 
d
1
=
b
2
−
4
d 
1
​
 =b 
2
 −4

for 
x
2
+
d
x
+
1
=
0
x 
2
 +dx+1=0, discriminant 
d
2
=
d
2
−
4
d 
2
​
 =d 
2
 −4

so, for real roots, 
d
1
≥
0
d 
1
​
 ≥0 or 
d
2
≥
0
d 
2
​
 ≥0.

given that 
b
+
d
=
a
b+d=a and 
b
d
=
−
3
bd=−3, perhaps i can express 
d
1
d 
1
​
  and 
d
2
d 
2
​
  in terms of 
a
a.

wait, but 
b
b and 
d
d are related via 
b
+
d
=
a
b+d=a and 
b
d
=
−
3
bd=−3. so, i can think of 
b
b and 
d
d as roots of 
t
2
−
a
t
−
3
=
0
t 
2
 −at−3=0, as i said before.

so, 
b
=
a
+
a
2
+
12
2
b= 
2
a+ 
a 
2
 +12
​
 
​
  and 
d
=
a
−
a
2
+
12
2
d= 
2
a− 
a 
2
 +12
​
 
​
 , or vice versa.

then, 
d
1
=
b
2
−
4
=
(
a
+
a
2
+
12
2
)
2
−
4
d 
1
​
 =b 
2
 −4=( 
2
a+ 
a 
2
 +12
​
 
​
 ) 
2
 −4

similarly, 
d
2
=
d
2
−
4
=
(
a
−
a
2
+
12
2
)
2
−
4
d 
2
​
 =d 
2
 −4=( 
2
a− 
a 
2
 +12
​
 
​
 ) 
2
 −4

this seems messy. maybe there's a better approach.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that for the product of the two quadratics to have real roots, at least one quadratic must have real roots, as i thought earlier.

alternatively, maybe i can consider the original polynomial and make a substitution to simplify it.

let me try substituting 
y
=
x
−
a
4
y=x− 
4
a
​
 , but that might not help directly.

wait, perhaps dividing the entire polynomial by 
x
2
x 
2
 , assuming 
x
≠
0
x

=0:

x
2
+
a
x
−
1
+
a
x
+
1
x
2
=
0
x 
2
 +ax−1+ 
x
a
​
 + 
x 
2
 
1
​
 =0

hmm, that looks interesting. let me set 
z
=
x
+
1
x
z=x+ 
x
1
​
 , since that might simplify the expression.

then, 
z
=
x
+
1
x
z=x+ 
x
1
​
 , so 
z
2
=
x
2
+
2
+
1
x
2
z 
2
 =x 
2
 +2+ 
x 
2
 
1
​
 , which implies 
x
2
+
1
x
2
=
z
2
−
2
x 
2
 + 
x 
2
 
1
​
 =z 
2
 −2

similarly, 
x
−
1
x
=
(
x
+
1
x
)
2
−
4
=
z
2
−
4
x− 
x
1
​
 = 
(x+ 
x
1
​
 ) 
2
 −4
​
 = 
z 
2
 −4
​
 , but maybe that's not helpful here.

wait, going back to the expression after dividing by 
x
2
x 
2
 :

x
2
+
a
x
−
1
+
a
x
+
1
x
2
=
0
x 
2
 +ax−1+ 
x
a
​
 + 
x 
2
 
1
​
 =0

rearranged:

x
2
+
1
x
2
+
a
(
x
+
1
x
)
−
1
=
0
x 
2
 + 
x 
2
 
1
​
 +a(x+ 
x
1
​
 )−1=0

now, substitute 
z
=
x
+
1
x
z=x+ 
x
1
​
 , then 
z
2
=
x
2
+
2
+
1
x
2
z 
2
 =x 
2
 +2+ 
x 
2
 
1
​
 , so 
x
2
+
1
x
2
=
z
2
−
2
x 
2
 + 
x 
2
 
1
​
 =z 
2
 −2

plugging back in:

z
2
−
2
+
a
z
−
1
=
0
z 
2
 −2+az−1=0

simplify:

z
2
+
a
z
−
3
=
0
z 
2
 +az−3=0

so, now i have a quadratic equation in terms of 
z
z:

z
2
+
a
z
−
3
=
0
z 
2
 +az−3=0

now, solving for 
z
z:

z
=
−
a
±
a
2
+
12
2
z= 
2
−a± 
a 
2
 +12
​
 
​
 

but 
z
=
x
+
1
x
z=x+ 
x
1
​
 , and 
x
x is real, so 
z
z must satisfy 
∣
z
∣
≥
2
∣z∣≥2, because for real 
x
x, 
x
+
1
x
≥
2
x+ 
x
1
​
 ≥2 or 
≤
−
2
≤−2.

therefore, the solutions for 
z
z must satisfy 
∣
z
∣
≥
2
∣z∣≥2.

so, for the equation 
z
2
+
a
z
−
3
=
0
z 
2
 +az−3=0 to have solutions with 
∣
z
∣
≥
2
∣z∣≥2, there must be at least one root of this quadratic that lies outside the interval 
(
−
2
,
2
)
(−2,2).

now, to find when this happens.

first, find the roots of 
z
2
+
a
z
−
3
=
0
z 
2
 +az−3=0:

z
=
−
a
±
a
2
+
12
2
z= 
2
−a± 
a 
2
 +12
​
 
​
 

we need at least one of these roots to satisfy 
z
≥
2
z≥2 or 
z
≤
−
2
z≤−2.

let's analyze the roots.

first, the discriminant is 
a
2
+
12
a 
2
 +12, which is always positive, so there are always two real roots.

let me denote the roots as:

z
1
=
−
a
+
a
2
+
12
2
z 
1
​
 = 
2
−a+ 
a 
2
 +12
​
 
​
 

z
2
=
−
a
−
a
2
+
12
2
z 
2
​
 = 
2
−a− 
a 
2
 +12
​
 
​
 

now, we need either 
z
1
≥
2
z 
1
​
 ≥2 or 
z
1
≤
−
2
z 
1
​
 ≤−2, or 
z
2
≥
2
z 
2
​
 ≥2 or 
z
2
≤
−
2
z 
2
​
 ≤−2.

but since 
z
1
+
z
2
=
−
a
z 
1
​
 +z 
2
​
 =−a and 
z
1
z
2
=
−
3
z 
1
​
 z 
2
​
 =−3, we can consider their positions relative to 2 and -2.

alternatively, maybe it's easier to consider the conditions for the roots to lie outside the interval (-2,2).

the quadratic 
z
2
+
a
z
−
3
=
0
z 
2
 +az−3=0 has its vertex at 
z
=
−
a
2
z=− 
2
a
​
 , and opens upwards since the coefficient of 
z
2
z 
2
  is positive.

we can consider the minimum value of the quadratic, which occurs at 
z
=
−
a
2
z=− 
2
a
​
 , and is equal to 
(
−
a
2
)
2
+
a
(
−
a
2
)
−
3
=
a
2
4
−
a
2
2
−
3
=
−
a
2
4
−
3
(− 
2
a
​
 ) 
2
 +a(− 
2
a
​
 )−3= 
4
a 
2
 
​
 − 
2
a 
2
 
​
 −3=− 
4
a 
2
 
​
 −3, which is always negative since 
−
a
2
4
−
3
<
0
− 
4
a 
2
 
​
 −3<0 for all real 
a
a.

therefore, the quadratic is negative between its two real roots and positive outside.

so, the quadratic 
z
2
+
a
z
−
3
z 
2
 +az−3 is less than zero between its two roots and greater than zero outside.

we need at least one of the roots to be greater than or equal to 2 or less than or equal to -2.

alternatively, the quadratic must take negative values for some 
z
z outside the interval (-2,2), but since it's positive outside the roots, maybe i need to think differently.

wait, perhaps it's easier to consider that for there to be real 
z
z with 
∣
z
∣
≥
2
∣z∣≥2 satisfying 
z
2
+
a
z
−
3
=
0
z 
2
 +az−3=0, the quadratic must have at least one root outside the interval (-2,2).

to ensure that, we can check if the quadratic has at least one root greater than or equal to 2 or less than or equal to -2.

one way to check this is to evaluate the quadratic at 
z
=
2
z=2 and 
z
=
−
2
z=−2 and see the sign changes.

if 
q
(
2
)
<
0
q(2)<0, then since the quadratic is positive for large 
z
z, there must be a root greater than 2.

similarly, if 
q
(
−
2
)
<
0
q(−2)<0, there must be a root less than -2.

alternatively, if 
q
(
2
)
>
0
q(2)>0 and 
q
(
−
2
)
>
0
q(−2)>0, and the minimum of the quadratic is below zero, then both roots are between -2 and 2, which we don't want.

so, for the polynomial to have at least one real root, we need either 
q
(
2
)
<
0
q(2)<0 or 
q
(
−
2
)
<
0
q(−2)<0.

let's compute 
q
(
2
)
=
2
2
+
a
(
2
)
−
3
=
4
+
2
a
−
3
=
2
a
+
1
q(2)=2 
2
 +a(2)−3=4+2a−3=2a+1

similarly, 
q
(
−
2
)
=
(
−
2
)
2
+
a
(
−
2
)
−
3
=
4
−
2
a
−
3
=
−
2
a
+
1
q(−2)=(−2) 
2
 +a(−2)−3=4−2a−3=−2a+1

so, 
q
(
2
)
=
2
a
+
1
q(2)=2a+1

q
(
−
2
)
=
−
2
a
+
1
q(−2)=−2a+1

we need 
q
(
2
)
<
0
q(2)<0 or 
q
(
−
2
)
<
0
q(−2)<0.

therefore:

either 
2
a
+
1
<
0
2a+1<0 which implies 
a
<
−
1
2
a<− 
2
1
​
 

or 
−
2
a
+
1
<
0
−2a+1<0 which implies 
a
>
1
2
a> 
2
1
​
 

so, combining these, the polynomial has at least one real root when 
a
<
−
1
2
a<− 
2
1
​
  or 
a
>
1
2
a> 
2
1
​
 

wait a minute, but is this correct? let me double-check.

i need to ensure that if 
a
<
−
1
2
a<− 
2
1
​
  or 
a
>
1
2
a> 
2
1
​
 , then there's at least one real root.

alternatively, if 
−
1
2
≤
a
≤
1
2
− 
2
1
​
 ≤a≤ 
2
1
​
 , then both 
q
(
2
)
≥
0
q(2)≥0 and 
q
(
−
2
)
≥
0
q(−2)≥0, which would imply that both roots are between -2 and 2, meaning no real 
z
z outside that interval, and thus no real 
x
x, which would mean no real roots for the original polynomial.

wait, but i need to confirm this.

given that 
q
(
z
)
=
z
2

q(z)=z

 +az−3, and we've established that it's positive outside its roots and negative between its roots.

if both roots are between -2 and 2, then 
q
(

)
>
0
q(2)>0 and 
q
(
−

)
>
0
q(−2)>0, meaning the quadratic doesn't dip below zero outside of (-2,2), so no real 
z
z outside that interval would satisfy 
q
(
z
)
=
0
q(z)=0, and thus no real 
x
x would satisfy the original equation.

therefore, for the original polynomial to have at least one real root, we need at least one root of 
q
(
z
)
=
0
q(z)=0 to lie outside the interval (-2,2), which corresponds to

  or

hence, the values of
