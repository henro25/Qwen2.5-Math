Answer: To find the largest 4-digit integer congruent to \(15 \pmod{22}\), we start by expressing the number \(x\) in the form \(x = 22q + 15\), where \(q\) is an integer. we need \(x\) to be a 4-digit number, so \(x \leq 9999\).

\[
22q + 15 \leq 9999
\]

subtract 15 from both sides:

\[
22q \leq 9984
\]

divide both sides by 22:

\[
q \leq \frac{9984}{22}
\]

calculating the division:

\[
q \leq 453.8181
\]

since \(q\) must be an integer, the largest possible value for \(q\) is 453. substituting \(q = 453\) back into the expression for \(x\):

\[
x = 22 \times 453 + 15 = 9966 + 15 = 9981
\]

to verify, we check the remainder when 9981 is divided by 22:

\[
9981 \div 22 = 453 \text{ remainder } 15
\]

thus, \(9981 \equiv 15 \pmod{22}\), confirming that 9981 is indeed the largest 4-digit number satisfying the condition.

\[
\boxed{9981}
\]
