Reasoning: So i have this problem: what is the largest 4-digit integer congruent to 15 mod 22? hmm, okay, let's break this down.

first, i need to understand what it means for a number to be congruent to 15 modulo 22. in math terms, if a number x is congruent to 15 mod 22, that means when you divide x by 22, the remainder is 15. so, x ≡ 15 mod 22.

now, i need to find the largest 4-digit number that satisfies this condition. the largest 4-digit number is 9999. so, i need to check if 9999 is congruent to 15 mod 22, or if not, find the largest number less than 9999 that is.

to do this, i can use the division algorithm. any integer x can be expressed as x = 22 * q + r, where q is the quotient and r is the remainder when x is divided by 22, and 0 ≤ r < 22.

in this case, r should be 15. so, x = 22 * q + 15.

i need to find the largest x that is a 4-digit number, so x ≤ 9999.

so, 22 * q + 15 ≤ 9999.

let's solve for q:

22 * q ≤ 9999 - 15

22 * q ≤ 9984

q ≤ 9984 / 22

let me calculate that.

9984 divided by 22. let's do that division.

22 times 454 is 22 * 400 = 8800, 22 * 50 = 1100, so 22 * 450 = 9900.

9984 - 9900 = 84.

now, 22 * 3 = 66, and 84 - 66 = 18, which is less than 22, so q = 454 + 3 = 457, but there's a remainder of 18, which means q = 457 with a remainder.

wait, actually, i'm trying to find q such that 22 * q ≤ 9984.

so, q = floor(9984 / 22).

let me calculate 9984 / 22.

22 * 454 = 9988, which is greater than 9984, so q = 454 - 1 = 453.

wait, no. let me calculate it properly.

22 * 454 = 9988, which is larger than 9984, so q = 453.

let's check 22 * 453 = 9966.

yes, 22 * 453 = 9966.

so, the largest q is 453.

therefore, the largest x is 22 * 453 + 15 = 9966 + 15 = 9981.

so, 9981 is the largest 4-digit number that is congruent to 15 mod 22.

wait a second, is there a larger number than 9981 that is still a 4-digit number and satisfies x ≡ 15 mod 22?

let me check if 9981 + 22 is still a 4-digit number.

9981 + 22 = 10003, which is a 5-digit number, so that's too big.

therefore, 9981 is indeed the largest 4-digit number that is congruent to 15 mod 22.

let me verify this.

if i divide 9981 by 22, what is the remainder?

9981 / 22.

22 * 453 = 9966.

9981 - 9966 = 15.

yes, the remainder is 15, so 9981 ≡ 15 mod 22.

perfect.

so, the answer should be 9981.

**final answer**

9981
