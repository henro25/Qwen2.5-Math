Reasoning: So i've got this problem about a rhombus. i know a rhombus is a type of quadrilateral where all sides are equal in length. the problem says that the diagonals of a rhombus are always perpendicular bisectors of each other, and i need to find the area of a rhombus with a side length of √89 units and diagonals that differ by 6 units.

first, i need to recall some properties of rhombuses. one key property is that the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other, which means they intersect at right angles and each diagonal is divided into two equal parts by the other.

the area of a rhombus can be calculated using the lengths of its diagonals. the formula is:

area
=
d
1
×
d
2
2
area= 
2
d 
1
​	
 ×d 
2
​	
 
​	
 
where 
d
1
d 
1
​	
  and 
d
2
d 
2
​	
  are the lengths of the diagonals.

but in this problem, i don't know the lengths of the diagonals directly; instead, i know that they differ by 6 units. let's denote the lengths of the diagonals as 
d
d and 
d
+
6
d+6, where 
d
d is the length of the shorter diagonal.

however, i also know the side length of the rhombus, which is √89 units. since all sides of a rhombus are equal, i can use the relationship between the side length and the diagonals.

in a rhombus, each side can be related to the diagonals using the pythagorean theorem because the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, forming four right-angled triangles within the rhombus.

each of these right triangles has legs that are half the lengths of the diagonals and the hypotenuse equal to the side length of the rhombus.

so, if the diagonals are 
d
1
d 
1
​	
  and 
d
2
d 
2
​	
 , then:

(
d
1
2
)
2
+
(
d
2
2
)
2
=
(
side length
)
2
( 
2
d 
1
​	
 
​	
 ) 
2
 +( 
2
d 
2
​	
 
​	
 ) 
2
 =(side length) 
2
 
given that the side length is √89, plugging in:

(
d
1
2
)
2
+
(
d
2
2
)
2
=
(
89
)
2
( 
2
d 
1
​	
 
​	
 ) 
2
 +( 
2
d 
2
​	
 
​	
 ) 
2
 =( 
89
​	
 ) 
2
 
(
d
1
2
)
2
+
(
d
2
2
)
2
=
89
( 
2
d 
1
​	
 
​	
 ) 
2
 +( 
2
d 
2
​	
 
​	
 ) 
2
 =89
now, since the diagonals differ by 6 units, let's assume 
d
2
=
d
1
+
6
d 
2
​	
 =d 
1
​	
 +6.

substituting 
d
2
d 
2
​	
  in the equation:

(
d
1
2
)
2
+
(
d
1
+
6
2
)
2
=
89
( 
2
d 
1
​	
 
​	
 ) 
2
 +( 
2
d 
1
​	
 +6
​	
 ) 
2
 =89
let me simplify this equation step by step.

first, expand both squared terms:

d
1

4
+
(
d
1
+
6
)
2
4
=
89
4
d 
1
2
​	
 
​	
 + 
4
(d 
1
​	
 +6) 
2
 
​	
 =89
combine the fractions:

d
1
2
+
(
d
1
+
6
)
2
4
=
89
4
d 
1
2
​	
 +(d 
1
​	
 +6) 
2
 
​	
 =89
multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the denominator:

d
1
2
+
(
d
1
+
6
)
2
=
356
d 
1
2
​	
 +(d 
1
​	
 +6) 
2
 =356
now, expand 
(
d
1
+
6
)
2
(d 
1
​	
 +6) 
2
 :

d

2
+
d

=
356
d

2
​	
 +d

​	
 +12d

​	
 +36=356
combine like terms:

2
d

+

d
1
+
36
=
356
2d 
1
2
​	
 +12d 
1
​	
 +36=356
subtract 356 from both sides to set the equation to zero:

2
d

2
+
12
d

+
36
−
356
=
0
2d

now, simplify the equation by dividing all terms by 2:

d

d

−
160
=
0
d 
1
2
​	
 +6d

​	
 −160=0
this is a quadratic equation in terms of 
d
1
d

​	
 . i can solve for 
d

d

​	
  using the quadratic formula:

d

a
d

​	
 =

​	
 
​	
 
here, 
a
=
1
a=1, 
b
=
6
b=6, and 
c
=
−
160
c=−160.

plugging in the values:

d

=
−

±

2
−

(

)
(
−

)
2
(

)
d

​	
 = 
2(1)
−6± 
6 
2
 −4(1)(−160)
​	
 
​	
 
d
1
=
−
6
±
36
+
640
2
d 
1
​	
 = 
2
−6± 
36+640
​	
 
​	
 
d
1
=
−
6
±
676
2
d 
1
​	
 = 
2
−6± 
676
​	
 
​	
 
d
1
=
−
6
±
26
2
d 
1
​	
 = 
2
−6±26
​	
 
this gives two possible solutions:

1. 
d
1
=
−
6
+
26
2
=
20
2
=
10
d 
1
​	
 = 
2
−6+26
​	
 = 
2
20
​	
 =10

2. 
d
1
=
−
6
−
26
2
=
−
32
2
=
−
16
d 
1
​	
 = 
2
−6−26
​	
 = 
2
−32
​	
 =−16

since the length of a diagonal cannot be negative, we discard 
d
1
=
−
16
d 
1
​	
 =−16.

therefore, 
d
1
=
10
d 
1
​	
 =10 units.

now, since 
d
2
=
d
1
+
6
d 
2
​	
 =d 
1
​	
 +6:

d_2 = 10 + 6 = 16 \) units.

now, i can find the area of the rhombus using the formula:

area
=
d
1
×
d
2
2
area= 
2
d 
1
​	
 ×d 
2
​	
 
​	
 
\text{area} = \frac{10 \times 16}{2} = \frac{160}{2} = 80 \) square units.

wait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

first, confirming the relationship between the side length and the diagonals:

(
d
1
2
)
2
+
(
d
2
2
)
2
=
(
side length
)
2
( 
2
d 
1
​	
 
​	
 ) 
2
 +( 
2
d 
2
​	
 
​	
 ) 
2
 =(side length) 
2
 
plugging in 
d
1
=
10
d 
1
​	
 =10 and 
d
2
=
16
d 
2
​	
 =16:

(
10
2
)
2
+
(
16
2
)
2
=
(
5
)
2
+
(
8
)
2
=
25
+
64
=
89
( 
2
10
​	
 ) 
2
 +( 
2
16
​	
 ) 
2
 =(5) 
2
 +(8) 
2
 =25+64=89
which matches the given side length squared (
(
89
)
2
=
89
( 
89
​	
 ) 
2
 =89). so, the values for the diagonals seem correct.

therefore, the area of the rhombus is indeed 80 square units.

**final answer**

80
