Answer: Given a rhombus with side length \(\sqrt{89}\) units and diagonals that differ by 6 units, we need to find its area.

first, denote the lengths of the diagonals as \(d_1\) and \(d_2\), where \(d_2 = d_1 + 6\). using the property that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, we can relate the side length to the diagonals using the pythagorean theorem:

\[
\left( \frac{d_1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{d_2}{2} \right)^2 = (\sqrt{89})^2
\]

substituting \(d_2 = d_1 + 6\):

\[
\left( \frac{d_1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{d_1 + 6}{2} \right)^2 = 89
\]

simplifying:

\[
\frac{d_1^2}{4} + \frac{(d_1 + 6)^2}{4} = 89
\]

combining the fractions:

\[
\frac{d_1^2 + (d_1 + 6)^2}{4} = 89
\]

multiplying both sides by 4:

\[
d_1^2 + (d_1 + 6)^2 = 356
\]

expanding and combining like terms:

\[
d_1^2 + d_1^2 + 12d_1 + 36 = 356
\]
\[
2d_1^2 + 12d_1 + 36 = 356
\]
\[
2d_1^2 + 12d_1 - 320 = 0
\]

dividing by 2:

\[
d_1^2 + 6d_1 - 160 = 0
\]

solving the quadratic equation:

\[
d_1 = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{6^2 - 4(1)(-160)}}{2(1)}
\]
\[
d_1 = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{36 + 640}}{2}
\]
\[
d_1 = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{676}}{2}
\]
\[
d_1 = \frac{-6 \pm 26}{2}
\]

this gives:

1. \( d_1 = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \)
2. \( d_1 = \frac{-32}{2} = -16 \) (discarded as length cannot be negative)

thus, \( d_1 = 10 \) units and \( d_2 = 10 + 6 = 16 \) units.

the area of the rhombus is:

\[
\text{area} = \frac{d_1 \times d_2}{2} = \frac{10 \times 16}{2} = 80 \text{ square units}
\]

\[
\boxed{80}
\]
