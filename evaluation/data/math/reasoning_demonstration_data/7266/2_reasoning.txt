Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: let n and o be functions such that n(x) = 2√x, and o(x) = x². i need to find n(o(n(o(n(o(3)))))). wow, that looks a bit complicated with all the nested functions, but i think i can break it down step by step.

first, i need to understand what each function does. n(x) takes the square root of x and multiplies it by 2, and o(x) squares x. so, n is like scaling the square root of x by a factor of 2, and o is just squaring x.

now, the expression is n(o(n(o(n(o(3)))))), which means i have to apply these functions in a specific order, starting from the innermost function and working my way outwards. it might help to work from the inside out, evaluating each part step by step.

let's start with the innermost function: o(3). since o(x) = x², o(3) = 3² = 9. so, o(3) = 9.

now, the next function out is n(o(3)), which is n(9). n(x) = 2√x, so n(9) = 2 * √9. the square root of 9 is 3, so n(9) = 2 * 3 = 6.

next, we have o(n(o(3))), which is o(6). o(x) = x², so o(6) = 6² = 36.

then, n(o(n(o(3)))) is n(36). n(x) = 2√x, so n(36) = 2 * √36. the square root of 36 is 6, so n(36) = 2 * 6 = 12.

next, o(n(o(n(o(3))))) is o(12). o(x) = x², so o(12) = 12² = 144.

finally, n(o(n(o(n(o(3))))) is n(144). n(x) = 2√x, so n(144) = 2 * √144. the square root of 144 is 12, so n(144) = 2 * 12 = 24.

wait a minute, let me double-check that i didn't make any mistakes along the way. starting from o(3):

1. o(3) = 3² = 9

2. n(9) = 2 * √9 = 2 * 3 = 6

3. o(6) = 6² = 36

4. n(36) = 2 * √36 = 2 * 6 = 12

5. o(12) = 12² = 144

6. n(144) = 2 * √144 = 2 * 12 = 24

everything seems to check out. each step logically follows from the previous one, and the calculations are correct. i don't think i missed anything here.

alternatively, i could try to generalize this process to see if there's a pattern or a shortcut. let's see:

given n(x) = 2√x and o(x) = x², and we're applying them in the order n o n o n o starting from 3.

so, it's n o n o n o (3)

let's see if there's a pattern when composing these functions multiple times.

first, consider o(n(x)):

o(n(x)) = o(2√x) = (2√x)² = 4x

interesting, so o(n(x)) = 4x.

now, let's consider n(o(x)):

n(o(x)) = n(x²) = 2√(x²) = 2|x|

assuming x is positive, which it is in this case since we're dealing with square roots, so n(o(x)) = 2x.

hmm, that's interesting. so, o(n(x)) = 4x and n(o(x)) = 2x.

wait, that's a bit confusing. let me make sure i got that right.

o(n(x)) = o(2√x) = (2√x)² = 4x

n(o(x)) = n(x²) = 2√(x²) = 2|x| = 2x (since x is positive)

so, o(n(x)) = 4x and n(o(x)) = 2x.

now, in our original expression, it's n o n o n o (3). let's see:

start with x = 3

first apply o: o(3) = 9

then apply n: n(9) = 6

then apply o: o(6) = 36

then apply n: n(36) = 12

then apply o: o(12) = 144

then apply n: n(144) = 24

so, as i did before.

alternatively, if i look at the composition:

n o n o n o (x)

we can think of it as n ( o ( n ( o ( n ( o(x) )))))

but from above, o(n(x)) = 4x and n(o(x)) = 2x

wait, maybe i can find a pattern in terms of how many times we apply these compositions.

let's see:

let’s consider the composition of o and n:

let’s define p(x) = o(n(x)) = 4x

and q(x) = n(o(x)) = 2x

wait, but in our expression, it's n o n o n o (x), which is n ( o ( n ( o ( n ( o(x) )))))

so, it's n o n o n o(x)

let’s see if there is a way to simplify this by repeatedly applying these compositions.

but perhaps it's easier to just compute step by step as i did before, especially since it's only a finite number of compositions.

another way to look at it is to see that o(n(x)) = 4x and n(o(x)) = 2x, so maybe there’s a pattern in the coefficients.

let’s see:

starting with x

apply o: o(x) = x²

apply n: n(x²) = 2x

apply o: o(2x) = (2x)² = 4x²

apply n: n(4x²) = 2*(4x²)^{1/2} = 2*(2x) = 4x

apply o: o(4x) = (4x)^2 = 16x²

apply n: n(16x²) = 2*(16x²)^{1/2} = 2*(4x) = 8x

wait, but in our earlier step-by-step, starting from x=3, we got to 24, which is 8*3.

but according to this pattern, it seems like n o n o n o(x) = 8x

wait, but according to my step-by-step, n o n o n o(3) = 24, and 8*3 = 24, so it matches.

so, in general, n o n o n o(x) = 8x

is that right?

let’s check with x=1:

n o n o n o(1)

first o(1) = 1

n(1) = 2*1 = 2

o(2) = 4

n(4) = 2*2 = 4

o(4) = 16

n(16) = 2*4 = 8

so, n o n o n o(1) = 8*1 = 8, which matches 8*1=8.

another check with x=2:

n o n o n o(2)

o(2)=4

n(4)=4

o(4)=16

n(16)=8

o(8)=64

n(64)=16

and 8*2=16, which matches.

so, it seems like n o n o n o(x) = 8x

therefore, in this problem, n o n o n o(3) = 8*3 = 24.

this is consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation.

therefore, the final answer is 24.

**final answer**

24
