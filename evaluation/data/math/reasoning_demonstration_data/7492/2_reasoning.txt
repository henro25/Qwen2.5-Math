Reasoning: So i need to evaluate the expression 
⌈
5
4
⌉
+
⌊
−
5
4
⌋
⌈ 
4
5
​	
 ⌉+⌊− 
4
5
​	
 ⌋. hmm, let's start by understanding what the ceiling and floor functions do.

the ceiling function, denoted by 
⌈
x
⌉
⌈x⌉, gives the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to 
x
x. on the other hand, the floor function, denoted by 
⌊
x
⌋
⌊x⌋, gives the largest integer that is less than or equal to 
x
x.

first, let's find 
⌈
5
4
⌉
⌈ 
4
5
​	
 ⌉. calculating 
5
4
4
5
​	
  gives 
1.25
1.25. the smallest integer greater than or equal to 
1.25
1.25 is 
2
2, because 
1
1 is less than 
1.25
1.25 and 
2
2 is the next integer up. so, 
⌈
5
4
⌉
=
2
⌈ 
4
5
​	
 ⌉=2.

next, i need to find 
⌊
−
5
4
⌋
⌊− 
4
5
​	
 ⌋. calculating 
−
5
4
− 
4
5
​	
  gives 
−
1.25
−1.25. the largest integer less than or equal to 
−
1.25
−1.25 would be 
−
2
−2, since 
−
1
−1 is greater than 
−
1.25
−1.25 and 
−
2
−2 is the next integer down. so, 
⌊
−
5
4
⌋
=
−
2
⌊− 
4
5
​	
 ⌋=−2.

now, adding these two results together: 
2
+
(
−
2
)
=
0
2+(−2)=0.

wait a minute, is that right? let me double-check. for the ceiling function, 
⌈
1.25
⌉
=
2
⌈1.25⌉=2 seems correct. for the floor function, 
⌊
−
1.25
⌋
=
−
2
⌊−1.25⌋=−2 also seems correct because 
−
2
−2 is less than 
−
1.25
−1.25 and is the largest integer that satisfies that condition.

alternatively, i recall that for negative numbers, the floor function behaves differently than one might intuitively expect. for example, 
⌊
−
1.2
⌋
=
−
2
⌊−1.2⌋=−2, not 
−
1
−1, because 
−
2
−2 is less than 
−
1.2
−1.2. similarly, 
⌈
−
1.2
⌉
=
−
1
⌈−1.2⌉=−1, because 
−
1
−1 is greater than 
−
1.2
−1.2.

let me confirm with another example. if i take 
⌈
2.3
⌉
⌈2.3⌉, it should be 
3
3, and 
⌊
−
2.3
⌋
⌊−2.3⌋ should be 
−
3
−3. yes, that aligns with what i did earlier.

so, going back to the original problem: 
⌈
5
4
⌉
=
2
⌈ 
4
5
​	
 ⌉=2 and 
⌊
−
5
4
⌋
=
−
2
⌊− 
4
5
​	
 ⌋=−2, and their sum is 
0
0.

is there another way to approach this? maybe by recalling some properties of ceiling and floor functions. i know that for any real number 
x
x, 
⌈
x
⌉
−
x
⌈x⌉−x is always less than 
1
1, and 
x
−
⌊
x
⌋
x−⌊x⌋ is also less than 
1
1. but i'm not sure if that helps here.

alternatively, i could consider that 
⌈
x
⌉
+
⌊
−
x
⌋
⌈x⌉+⌊−x⌋ has a specific property. let's see, if 
x
x is not an integer, then 
⌈
x
⌉
+
⌊
−
x
⌋
=
−
⌊
x
⌋
+
⌊
−
x
⌋
⌈x⌉+⌊−x⌋=−⌊x⌋+⌊−x⌋, but that seems more complicated.

wait, actually, there is a property that says 
⌈
x
⌉
+
⌊
−
x
⌋
=
0
⌈x⌉+⌊−x⌋=0 when 
x
x is an integer, but i'm not sure about non-integer values.

let me test this property with some numbers. if 
x
=
1.5
x=1.5, then 
⌈
1.5
⌉
=
2
⌈1.5⌉=2 and 
⌊
−
1.5
⌋
=
−
2
⌊−1.5⌋=−2, so 
2
+
(
−
2
)
=
0
2+(−2)=0. if 
x
=
2
x=2, which is an integer, 
⌈
2
⌉
=
2
⌈2⌉=2 and 
⌊
−
2
⌋
=
−
2
⌊−2⌋=−2, again 
2
+
(
−
2
)
=
0
2+(−2)=0. if 
x
=
−
1.5
x=−1.5, 
⌈
−
1.5
⌉
=
−
1
⌈−1.5⌉=−1 and 
⌊
1.5
⌋
=
1
⌊1.5⌋=1, so 
−
1
+
1
=
0
−1+1=0.

so, it seems like in all these cases, the sum is 
0
0. maybe this is a general property: 
⌈
x
⌉
+
⌊
−
x
⌋
=
0
⌈x⌉+⌊−x⌋=0 for all real numbers 
x
x.

if that's the case, then for 
x
=
5
4
x= 
4
5
​	
 , the sum should indeed be 
0
0, which matches what i calculated earlier.

however, i should verify if this property holds in general. let's consider 
x
=
0.7
x=0.7. then 
⌈
0.7
⌉
=
1
⌈0.7⌉=1 and 
⌊
−
0.7
⌋
=
−
1
⌊−0.7⌋=−1, so 
1
+
(
−
1
)
=
0
1+(−1)=0. another example: 
x
=
−
0.3
x=−0.3, 
⌈
−
0.3
⌉
=
0
⌈−0.3⌉=0 and 
⌊
0.3
⌋
=
0
⌊0.3⌋=0, so 
0
+
0
=
0
0+0=0. it seems consistent.

therefore, i can conclude that 
⌈
5
4
⌉
+
⌊
−
5
4
⌋
=
0
⌈ 
4
5
​	
 ⌉+⌊− 
4
5
​	
 ⌋=0.

**final answer**
