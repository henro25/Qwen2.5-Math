Reasoning: So i need to find the value of cosine of 
5
π
4
4
5π
​
 . hmm, i'm a bit rusty on my trigonometry, but i think i can figure this out by breaking it down step by step.

first, i know that angles in trigonometry are often measured in radians, and 
π
π radians is equal to 180 degrees. so, 
5
π
4
4
5π
​
  radians would be equal to 
5
4
×
180
4
5
​
 ×180 degrees. let me calculate that: 
5
4
×
180
=
225
4
5
​
 ×180=225 degrees. okay, so 
cos
⁡
5
π
4
cos 
4
5π
​
  is the same as 
cos
⁡
22
5
∘
cos225 
∘
 .

now, i need to find the cosine of 225 degrees. i remember that the cosine function gives the x-coordinate of a point on the unit circle corresponding to a given angle. so, i should visualize where 225 degrees is on the unit circle.

225 degrees is in the third quadrant because it's between 180 degrees and 270 degrees. in the third quadrant, both sine and cosine values are negative. that means 
cos
⁡
22
5
∘
cos225 
∘
  should be negative.

to find the exact value, i can use the reference angle. the reference angle for 225 degrees is 225 degrees minus 180 degrees, which is 45 degrees. so, the reference angle is 45 degrees.

i recall that 
cos
⁡
4
5
∘
=
2

cos45 
∘
 =

​
 
​
 . but since 225 degrees is in the third quadrant where cosine is negative, 
cos
⁡
22
5
∘
=
−
2

cos225 
∘
 =−

​
 
​
 .

wait a minute, is that correct? let me double-check. the cosine of 45 degrees is indeed 
2
2
2
2
​
 
​
 , and since 225 degrees is in the third quadrant where cosine is negative, it should be negative. so, yes, 
cos
⁡
22
5
∘
=
−
2
2
cos225 
∘
 =− 
2

​
 
​
 .

alternatively, i can use the unit circle formula for cosine. the coordinates on the unit circle for an angle 
θ
θ are 
(
cos
⁡
θ
,
sin
⁡
θ
)
(cosθ,sinθ). for 
θ
=
5
π
4
θ= 
4
5π
​
 , the coordinates should be 
(
−
2
2
,
−
2

)
(− 
2
2
​
 
​
 ,− 
2
2
​
 
​
 ), which confirms that 
cos

5
π
4
=
−
2

cos 
4
5π
​
 =− 
2

​
 
​
 .

another way to look at it is by using the cosine addition formula. 
5
π
4
4
5π
​
  can be expressed as 
π
+
π
4
π+

​
 . using the cosine addition formula:

cos

(

)
=

i know that 
cos

cosπ=−1, 
sin

sinπ=0, 
cos

π

cos

​

​
 
​
 , and 
sin
⁡
π
4
=
2
2
sin 
4
π
​
 = 
2

​
 
​
 . plugging these values in:

cos

(

)
=

so, this method also gives me 
−

−

​
 
​
 , which matches my earlier result.

i think i've confirmed it enough times. therefore, the value of 
cos

​
  is 
−
