Reasoning: So i have this problem here. i have two vectors, a and b, given as:

a = [3, 1, -2]

b = [0, 2, -1]

and there's this equation:

[4, 1, -4] = p*a + q*b + r*(a × b)

i need to find the value of r.

first, i need to understand what this equation is saying. it's expressing the vector [4, 1, -4] as a linear combination of vectors a, b, and the cross product of a and b, with coefficients p, q, and r respectively.

i recall that the cross product of two vectors is perpendicular to both of them. so, a × b is perpendicular to both a and b.

this seems like a decomposition of the vector [4, 1, -4] into components that lie in the plane spanned by a and b, and a component that is perpendicular to that plane, which is given by r*(a × b).

so, to find r, maybe i can take the dot product of both sides with a × b. since a and b are both perpendicular to a × b, their dot products with a × b should be zero. that way, only the term with r*(a × b) will remain.

let me try that.

first, compute a × b.

a × b = |i    j    k|

|3    1   -2|

|0    2   -1|

calculating the determinant:

i*(1*(-1) - (-2)*2) - j*(3*(-1) - (-2)*0) + k*(3*2 - 1*0)

= i*(-1 + 4) - j*(-3 - 0) + k*(6 - 0)

= 3i + 3j + 6k

so, a × b = [3, 3, 6]

now, take the dot product of both sides with a × b.

[4, 1, -4] ⋅ [3, 3, 6] = p*a ⋅ [3, 3, 6] + q*b ⋅ [3, 3, 6] + r*(a × b) ⋅ [3, 3, 6]

but since a and b are perpendicular to a × b, their dot products with a × b should be zero.

let me verify that.

a ⋅ (a × b) = 3*3 + 1*3 + (-2)*6 = 9 + 3 - 12 = 0

b ⋅ (a × b) = 0*3 + 2*3 + (-1)*6 = 0 + 6 - 6 = 0

yes, both are zero. so, the equation simplifies to:

[4, 1, -4] ⋅ [3, 3, 6] = r*[3, 3, 6] ⋅ [3, 3, 6]

compute the dot products.

left side: 4*3 + 1*3 + (-4)*6 = 12 + 3 - 24 = -9

right side: r*(3*3 + 3*3 + 6*6) = r*(9 + 9 + 36) = r*54

so, -9 = 54r

therefore, r = -9 / 54 = -1/6

so, r is -1/6.

wait, but i should make sure i didn't make any calculation errors.

let me double-check the cross product a × b.

a = [3, 1, -2]

b = [0, 2, -1]

a × b = [ (1*(-1) - (-2)*2), (-2*0 - 3*(-1)), (3*2 - 1*0) ]

= [ (-1 + 4), (0 + 3), (6 - 0) ]

= [3, 3, 6]

that's correct.

dot product [4,1,-4] ⋅ [3,3,6] = 12 + 3 -24 = -9

dot product [3,3,6] ⋅ [3,3,6] = 9 + 9 + 36 = 54

so, -9 = 54r => r = -1/6

yes, that seems correct.

alternatively, i could solve the equation by setting up a system of equations, but that would be more time-consuming. this method seems efficient and gives a clear answer.

i think i've got it.
