Reasoning: Let's tackle this problem step by step. we have a square labeled abcd, and it undergoes a series of transformations: first, a 90-degree clockwise rotation about its center, and then a reflection over its vertical line of symmetry. this pattern of rotation and reflection continues alternately, and we need to find the position of the 2007th square in this sequence.

first, let's understand what happens in each step.

**initial position: abcd**

- let's assume the square is positioned with vertex a at the lower left, b at the upper left, c at the upper right, and d at the lower right.

**step 1: rotate 90 degrees clockwise**

when we rotate the square 90 degrees clockwise about its center, each vertex moves to the position of the next vertex in clockwise order.

- a moves to d's position.

- b moves to a's position.

- c moves to b's position.

- d moves to c's position.

so, after rotation, the new order is dabc.

wait, but according to the problem, after rotation, it's dabc. hmm, that matches what i just described.

**step 2: reflect over the vertical line of symmetry**

now, we take the square in position dabc and reflect it over its vertical line of symmetry.

first, let's visualize the vertical line of symmetry. in the original square abcd, the vertical line of symmetry would be the line that runs down the middle of the square from top to bottom.

when we reflect dabc over this vertical line:

- the left side becomes the right side and vice versa.

so, let's see:

- d is on the far left; reflecting it over the vertical line would place it on the far right.

- a is the lower left; reflecting it would place it at the lower right.

- b is the upper left; reflecting it would place it at the upper right.

- c is the upper right; reflecting it would place it at the upper left.

wait, but that doesn't seem right. let's think again.

actually, in the position dabc:

- d is at the lower left.

- a is at the upper left.

- b is at the upper right.

- c is at the lower right.

reflecting over the vertical line of symmetry swaps the left and right sides.

so:

- d (lower left) swaps with c (lower right) → c at lower left, d at lower right.

- a (upper left) swaps with b (upper right) → b at upper left, a at upper right.

so, after reflection, the order is cbad.

this matches the problem statement: cbad.

**step 3: rotate 90 degrees clockwise again**

now, we rotate cbad 90 degrees clockwise.

- c moves to d's position.

- b moves to c's position.

- a moves to b's position.

- d moves to a's position.

wait, but in the current position cbad:

- lower left: c

- upper left: b

- upper right: a

- lower right: d

after rotating 90 degrees clockwise:

- c (lower left) moves to d's position (lower right).

- b (upper left) moves to c's position (upper right).

- a (upper right) moves to b's position (upper left).

- d (lower right) moves to a's position (lower left).

so, the new order is dcba.

**step 4: reflect over the vertical line of symmetry again**

now, reflect dcba over the vertical line of symmetry.

in dcba:

- lower left: d

- upper left: c

- upper right: b

- lower right: a

reflecting over the vertical line swaps left and right:

- d (lower left) swaps with a (lower right) → a at lower left, d at lower right.

- c (upper left) swaps with b (upper right) → b at upper left, c at upper right.

so, after reflection, the order is adcb.

**observing the pattern**

let's list out the positions we've obtained so far:

1. abcd (initial)

2. dabc (after rotation)

3. cbad (after reflection)

4. dcba (after rotation)

5. adcb (after reflection)

let's continue a couple more steps to see if a pattern emerges.

**step 5: rotate 90 degrees clockwise**

current position: adcb

- a (lower left) moves to d's position (lower right).

- d (upper left) moves to a's position (lower left).

- c (upper right) moves to b's position (upper left).

- b (lower right) moves to c's position (upper right).

so, the new order is bdac.

**step 6: reflect over the vertical line of symmetry**

current position: bdac

- lower left: b

- upper left: d

- upper right: a

- lower right: c

reflecting over the vertical line swaps left and right:

- b (lower left) swaps with c (lower right) → c at lower left, b at lower right.

- d (upper left) swaps with a (upper right) → a at upper left, d at upper right.

so, after reflection, the order is cadb.

now, our sequence is:

1. abcd

2. dabc

3. cbad

4. dcba

5. adcb

6. bdac

7. cadb

let's do one more step.

**step 7: rotate 90 degrees clockwise**

current position: cadb

- c (lower left) moves to d's position (lower right).

- a (upper left) moves to c's position (upper right).

- d (upper right) moves to b's position (upper left).

- b (lower right) moves to a's position (lower left).

so, the new order is b c a d.

wait, let's be careful:

- c (lower left) moves to lower right: d's position → d at lower right.

- a (upper left) moves to upper right: c's position → c at upper right.

- d (upper right) moves to upper left: b's position → b at upper left.

- b (lower right) moves to lower left: a's position → a at lower left.

so, the new order is a b c d.

wait a minute, that's back to the initial position abcd.

so, after 7 steps, we're back to abcd.

but step 1 was abcd, step 2 was dabc, step 3 was cbad, step 4 was dcba, step 5 was adcb, step 6 was bdac, step 7 was cadb, and step 8 would be abcd again.

wait, but according to my previous step, step 7 was cadb, and step 8 would be rotate to get back to abcd.

but in my calculation, step 7: cadb rotated 90 degrees clockwise gives abcd.

wait, no, step 7 was cadb, and rotating that 90 degrees clockwise:

- c (lower left) → d's position (lower right): d

- a (upper left) → c's position (upper right): c

- d (upper right) → b's position (upper left): b

- b (lower right) → a's position (lower left): a

so, indeed, it becomes abcd.

therefore, the cycle repeats every 7 steps.

wait, but step 1 is abcd, and step 8 is abcd again, so the cycle length is 7.

but let's confirm.

from step 1 to step 7, we have:

1. abcd

2. dabc

3. cbad

4. dcba

5. adcb

6. bdac

7. cadb

8. abcd

so, every 7 steps, it cycles back to abcd.

therefore, the pattern repeats every 7 steps.

now, we need to find the position of the 2007th square.

to find this, we can find 2007 modulo 7 to determine where in the cycle we are.

first, calculate 2007 divided by 7.

let's do that.

7 × 286 = 2002

2007 - 2002 = 5

so, 2007 = 7 × 286 + 5

therefore, 2007 ≡ 5 mod 7

that means the 2007th square is the same as the 5th square in the cycle.

looking back at our sequence:

1. abcd

2. dabc

3. cbad

4. dcba

5. adcb

6. bdac

7. cadb

8. abcd

so, the 5th position is adcb.

therefore, the 2007th square should be in position adcb.

but the problem says: "write your answer starting with the lower left vertex and continuing clockwise with the other three vertices."

in our initial assumption, a is at lower left, b at upper left, c at upper right, d at lower right.

so, in the position adcb:

- lower left: a

- upper left: d

- upper right: c

- lower right: b

therefore, starting from lower left and going clockwise: a → d → c → b.

so, the order is a d c b, which we write as adcb without spaces or commas.

but wait, the problem mentions "lower left vertex and continuing clockwise with the other three vertices."

in the initial position abcd:

- lower left: a

- upper left: b

- upper right: c

- lower right: d

wait, now i'm getting confused.

looking back at the asymptote code:

label("$a$",(0,0),sw); // lower left

label("$b$",(0,10),nw); // upper left

label("$c$",(10,10),ne); // upper right

label("$d$",(10,0),se); // lower right

so, the square is positioned with a at lower left, b at upper left, c at upper right, d at lower right.

after rotation and reflection, positions change accordingly.

now, in the 5th step, position is adcb:

- lower left: a

- upper left: d

- upper right: c

- lower right: b

so, starting from lower left and going clockwise: a (lower left), d (upper left), c (upper right), b (lower right).

therefore, the order is a d c b, which is adcb.

so, the answer should be adcb.

but to be sure, let's double-check the cycle.

1. abcd

2. dabc

3. cbad

4. dcba

5. adcb

6. bdac

7. cadb

8. abcd

yes, the cycle repeats every 7 steps.

2007 mod 7 is 5, so the 2007th square is the same as the 5th, which is adcb.

therefore, the answer is adcb.

**final answer**

adcb​
