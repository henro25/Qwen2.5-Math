Answer: First, we start with the initial position of the square as abcd. we then alternate between rotating the square 90 degrees clockwise and reflecting it over its vertical line of symmetry.

1. initial position: abcd
2. rotate 90 degrees clockwise: dabc
3. reflect over vertical line of symmetry: cbad
4. rotate 90 degrees clockwise: dcba
5. reflect over vertical line of symmetry: adcb
6. rotate 90 degrees clockwise: bdac
7. reflect over vertical line of symmetry: cadb
8. rotate 90 degrees clockwise: abcd (cycle repeats)

the pattern repeats every 7 steps. to find the position of the 2007th square, we calculate \( 2007 \mod 7 \):

\[ 2007 = 7 \times 286 + 5 \]

thus, the 2007th square corresponds to the 5th position in the cycle, which is adcb.

therefore, the position of the 2007th square is:

\[
\boxed{adcb}
\]
