Problem: Homewood Middle School has 1200 students, and 730 of these students attend a summer picnic. If two-thirds of the girls in the school and one-half of the boys in the school attend the picnic, how many girls attend the picnic?  (Assume that each student in the school is either a boy or a girl.)
