Problem: The circles $C_1$ and $C_2$ are defined by the equations $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ and $(x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 16,$ respectively.  Find the locus of the centers $(a,b)$ of all circles externally tangent to $C_1$ and internally tangent to $C_2.$  Enter your answer in the form
\[Pa^2 + Qb^2 + Ra + Sb + T = 0,\]where all the coefficients are integers, $P$ is positive, and $\gcd(|P|,|Q|,|R|,|S|,|T|) = 1.$

Note: The word "locus" is a fancy word for "set" in geometry, so "the locus of the centers" means "the set of the centers".
