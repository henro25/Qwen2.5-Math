Answer: To solve the problem, we start by converting the base six number \(53_6\) to its decimal equivalent:

\[
53_6 = 5 \times 6^1 + 3 \times 6^0 = 5 \times 6 + 3 \times 1 = 30 + 3 = 33
\]

next, we convert the base \(b\) number \(113_b\) to its decimal equivalent:

\[
113_b = 1 \times b^2 + 1 \times b^1 + 3 \times b^0 = b^2 + b + 3
\]

since these two expressions are equal, we set them equal to each other:

\[
b^2 + b + 3 = 33
\]

this simplifies to the quadratic equation:

\[
b^2 + b - 30 = 0
\]

we solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(b = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = -30\):

\[
b = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-30)}}{2 \times 1} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 120}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2}
\]

since \(\sqrt{121} = 11\), we have:

\[
b = \frac{-1 \pm 11}{2}
\]

this gives us two possible solutions:

\[
b = \frac{-1 + 11}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \quad \text{and} \quad b = \frac{-1 - 11}{2} = \frac{-12}{2} = -6
\]

since the base cannot be negative, we discard \(b = -6\). therefore, the positive value of \(b\) is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]
