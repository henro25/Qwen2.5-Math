Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: the base six number 53₆ is equal to the base b number 113_b. i need to find the positive value of b. alright, let's break this down.

first off, i need to understand what it means for a number to be in a certain base. in base six, the number 53₆ means 5 times 6 to the power of 1 plus 3 times 6 to the power of 0. so, 5*6 + 3*1 = 30 + 3 = 33 in decimal, right?

similarly, 113_b means 1 times b squared plus 1 times b to the power of 1 plus 3 times b to the power of 0. so, 1*b² + 1*b + 3*1 = b² + b + 3.

now, the problem says these two numbers are equal. so, i can set them equal to each other:

b² + b + 3 = 33.

alright, now i have a quadratic equation: b² + b + 3 - 33 = 0, which simplifies to b² + b - 30 = 0.

to solve for b, i can use the quadratic formula: b = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a), where a = 1, b = 1, and c = -30.

plugging in the values, i get b = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 120)] / 2 = [-1 ± sqrt(121)] / 2.

sqrt(121) is 11, so b = [-1 ± 11] / 2.

that gives me two possible solutions: b = (-1 + 11)/2 = 10/2 = 5, and b = (-1 - 11)/2 = -12/2 = -6.

but wait, base can't be negative, right? so, b must be 5.

let me double-check to make sure.

if b = 5, then 113_5 should equal 33 in decimal.

let's calculate 113_5: 1*25 + 1*5 + 3*1 = 25 + 5 + 3 = 33. yep, that matches 53_6, which is also 33.

so, the positive value of b is 5.

**final answer**

5
