Reasoning: 
So i've got this problem about pascal's triangle, and i need to find out in which row there are three consecutive entries that are in the ratio 3:4:5. the top row is the 0th row, and each entry is the sum of the two entries above it. okay, let's start by recalling what pascal's triangle looks like.

pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. the nth row corresponds to the coefficients of (a + b)^n. so, the entries in the nth row are c(n, 0), c(n, 1), ..., c(n, n), where c(n, k) is the binomial coefficient "n choose k".

given that, if i have three consecutive entries in the nth row, they would be c(n, k), c(n, k+1), and c(n, k+2) for some k. and these are supposed to be in the ratio 3:4:5.

so, i can write:

c(n, k) : c(n, k+1) : c(n, k+2) = 3 : 4 : 5

this means:

c(n, k+1)/c(n, k) = 4/3

and

c(n, k+2)/c(n, k+1) = 5/4

now, i know that c(n, k+1)/c(n, k) = (n - k)/(k + 1)

similarly, c(n, k+2)/c(n, k+1) = (n - k - 1)/(k + 2)

so, setting these equal to 4/3 and 5/4 respectively:

(n - k)/(k + 1) = 4/3

and

(n - k - 1)/(k + 2) = 5/4

now i have two equations with two variables, n and k. i can solve for them.

first equation:

(n - k)/(k + 1) = 4/3

cross-multiplying:

3(n - k) = 4(k + 1)

3n - 3k = 4k + 4

3n = 7k + 4

so, n = (7k + 4)/3

second equation:

(n - k - 1)/(k + 2) = 5/4

cross-multiplying:

4(n - k - 1) = 5(k + 2)

4n - 4k - 4 = 5k + 10

4n = 9k + 14

now, substitute n from the first equation into this:

4*(7k + 4)/3 = 9k + 14

multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator:

4*(7k + 4) = 3*(9k + 14)

28k + 16 = 27k + 42

28k - 27k = 42 - 16

k = 26

now, plug k back into the expression for n:

n = (7*26 + 4)/3 = (182 + 4)/3 = 186/3 = 62

so, n = 62 and k = 26.

wait a minute, let's check if this makes sense.

first, let's verify the ratios.

compute c(62,26), c(62,27), c(62,28).

but calculating binomial coefficients for such large n and k directly would be tedious. maybe there's a better way to verify.

alternatively, i can use the ratio properties.

we have c(n, k+1)/c(n, k) = (n - k)/(k + 1)

plugging in n=62 and k=26:

(62 - 26)/(26 + 1) = 36/27 = 4/3

similarly, c(n, k+2)/c(n, k+1) = (n - k - 1)/(k + 2) = (62 - 26 - 1)/(26 + 2) = 35/28 = 5/4

so, the ratios check out.

therefore, in the 62nd row, the entries c(62,26), c(62,27), c(62,28) are in the ratio 3:4:5.

wait, but the problem asks for the row number, and it mentions that the top row is the 0th row. so, is the answer 62?

but let's see if there might be any smaller rows that satisfy this condition. maybe there's a row with smaller n where this happens.

alternatively, perhaps n=62 is indeed the smallest such row, or maybe the only one.

to check if there are other possible solutions, let's consider the system of equations again.

we had:

n = (7k + 4)/3

and

4n = 9k + 14

we solved for k=26 and n=62.

are there any other integer solutions for k and n?

well, n and k have to be integers, with 0 ≤ k ≤ n.

from n = (7k + 4)/3, for n to be integer, 7k + 4 must be divisible by 3.

so, 7k + 4 ≡ 0 mod 3

since 7 ≡ 1 mod 3, this becomes:

k + 1 ≡ 0 mod 3

so, k ≡ 2 mod 3

similarly, from 4n = 9k + 14, with n integer, 9k + 14 must be divisible by 4.

9k + 14 ≡ 0 mod 4

9 ≡ 1 mod 4, so:

k + 14 ≡ 0 mod 4

k ≡ -14 mod 4

-14 ≡ 2 mod 4, so k ≡ 2 mod 4

now, combining the two congruences:

k ≡ 2 mod 3 and k ≡ 2 mod 4

by the chinese remainder theorem, since 3 and 4 are coprime, there's a unique solution modulo 12.

find k such that k ≡ 2 mod 3 and k ≡ 2 mod 4.

let's list numbers congruent to 2 mod 4: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, etc.

check which of these are ≡2 mod 3:

2: 2 mod 3

6: 0 mod 3

10: 1 mod 3

14: 2 mod 3

so, k ≡ 2 mod 12.

therefore, general solution is k = 12m + 2, where m is a non-negative integer.

then, n = (7k + 4)/3 = (7*(12m + 2) + 4)/3 = (84m + 14 + 4)/3 = (84m + 18)/3 = 28m + 6

so, for each integer m ≥ 0, we have a solution k = 12m + 2, n = 28m + 6.

now, k must be less than or equal to n.

so, 12m + 2 ≤ 28m + 6

which simplifies to:

12m + 2 ≤ 28m + 6

subtract 12m from both sides:

2 ≤ 16m + 6

subtract 6:

-4 ≤ 16m

which is always true for m ≥ 0.

so, for each m ≥ 0, we have a solution.

let's try m=0:

k=2, n=6

check the ratios:

c(6,2)=15, c(6,3)=20, c(6,4)=15

ratios: 15:20:15, which is 3:4:3, not 3:4:5.

wait, that's not matching.

hmm, maybe m=0 is not valid.

wait, perhaps m starts from 1.

try m=1:

k=14, n=34

check c(34,14), c(34,15), c(34,16)

this would be tedious to compute, but perhaps there's a pattern.

alternatively, perhaps m=2:

k=26, n=62, which is what i found earlier.

given that, it seems like m=2 gives the first valid solution where the ratios are 3:4:5.

wait, but for m=1, k=14, n=34:

c(34,14)/c(34,13) = (34-13)/(14) = 21/14 = 3/2, which is not 4/3.

wait, that doesn't make sense. maybe my earlier assumption is wrong.

wait, perhaps i need to verify the ratios for m=1.

compute c(34,14)/c(34,13):

c(34,14)/c(34,13) = (34-13)/14 = 21/14 = 3/2, which is not 4/3.

similarly, c(34,15)/c(34,14) = (34-14)/15 = 20/15 = 4/3

wait, but according to earlier, c(n,k+1)/c(n,k) should be 4/3.

wait, perhaps i have an error in my earlier assumption.

wait, maybe i need to check more carefully.

given c(n,k+1)/c(n,k) = (n - k)/(k + 1) = 4/3

similarly, c(n,k+2)/c(n,k+1) = (n - k -1)/(k + 2) = 5/4

earlier, with m=2, k=26, n=62, it worked.

with m=1, k=14, n=34:

(n - k)/(k + 1) = (34-14)/(14+1) = 20/15 = 4/3

(n - k -1)/(k + 2) = (34-14-1)/(14+2) = 19/16, which is not 5/4.

so, for m=1, it doesn't satisfy the second equation.

wait, but according to the system of equations, it should.

wait, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that for each m, both equations are satisfied.

wait, let's see.

from n = 28m + 6 and k = 12m + 2.

plug into the second ratio:

(n - k -1)/(k + 2) = (28m + 6 - 12m - 2 -1)/(12m + 2 + 2) = (16m + 3)/(12m + 4)

we want this to be 5/4.

so, set (16m + 3)/(12m + 4) = 5/4

cross-multiply: 4*(16m + 3) = 5*(12m + 4)

64m + 12 = 60m + 20

64m - 60m = 20 - 12

4m = 8

m = 2

so, only for m=2 does this hold.

therefore, the only solution is m=2, which gives k=26, n=62.

hence, the answer is the 62nd row.

**final answer**
