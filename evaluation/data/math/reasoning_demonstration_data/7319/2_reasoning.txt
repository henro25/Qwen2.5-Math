Reasoning: Alright, so I have this problem: "What is the greatest common factor of all two-digit palindromes?" Okay, first off, I need to understand what a palindrome is. From the note, it says a palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. So, for two-digit numbers, that would be numbers like 11, 22, 33, up to 99, right? Because, for example, 12 isn't a palindrome because it reads as 12 forwards and 21 backwards, which are different.

So, the two-digit palindromes are 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99. That seems straightforward. Now, I need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of all these numbers. The GCF is the largest number that divides each of them without leaving a remainder.

I remember that to find the GCF of multiple numbers, one way is to find the prime factors of each number and then identify the common factors among them.

Let me list out the prime factors for each of these palindromes:

- 11 is a prime number, so its prime factors are just 11.

- 22 is 2 times 11.

- 33 is 3 times 11.

- 44 is 4 times 11, and 4 is 2 squared, so 44 is 2^2 times 11.

- 55 is 5 times 11.

- 66 is 6 times 11, and 6 is 2 times 3, so 66 is 2 times 3 times 11.

- 77 is 7 times 11.

- 88 is 8 times 11, and 8 is 2 cubed, so 88 is 2^3 times 11.

- 99 is 9 times 11, and 9 is 3 squared, so 99 is 3^2 times 11.

Looking at all these prime factors, the only common factor in all of them is 11. All these numbers are multiples of 11, and 11 itself is a prime number, so it doesn't have any other factors besides 1 and itself.

Wait a minute, is there any chance that there's a larger common factor? Let's see, if I consider 11, and check if any larger number divides all these palindromes. Since 11 is a prime number, the only possible common factors are 1 and 11.

I don't think there's a number larger than 11 that divides all of these palindromes because 11 is already a prime number. So, the GCF should be 11.

But, just to be thorough, maybe I should check if 11 actually divides all these numbers:

- 11 divided by 11 is 1, which is an integer.

- 22 divided by 11 is 2, which is an integer.

- 33 divided by 11 is 3, which is an integer.

- 44 divided by 11 is 4, which is an integer.

- 55 divided by 11 is 5, which is an integer.

- 66 divided by 11 is 6, which is an integer.

- 77 divided by 11 is 7, which is an integer.

- 88 divided by 11 is 8, which is an integer.

- 99 divided by 11 is 9, which is an integer.

Yep, 11 divides all of them perfectly. And since 11 is prime, there's no larger number that can divide all of them. So, the greatest common factor of all two-digit palindromes is indeed 11.
