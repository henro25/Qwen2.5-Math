Answer: To solve the problem of finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of all two-digit palindromes, we first identify the two-digit palindromes: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99. 

Next, we factor each of these numbers:

- 11 = 11
- 22 = 2 × 11
- 33 = 3 × 11
- 44 = 2² × 11
- 55 = 5 × 11
- 66 = 2 × 3 × 11
- 77 = 7 × 11
- 88 = 2³ × 11
- 99 = 3² × 11

The only common factor in all these numbers is 11. Since 11 is a prime number, it cannot be divided further, and there is no larger number that divides all of them.

Thus, the greatest common factor of all two-digit palindromes is **11**.
