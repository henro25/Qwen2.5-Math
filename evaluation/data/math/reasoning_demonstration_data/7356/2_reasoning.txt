Reasoning: So i have this problem here: for what digit 
d
d is the five-digit number 
2345
d
2345d a multiple of 9? alright, let's think about this step by step.

first off, i remember that there's a rule for determining if a number is divisible by 9. if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9, then the number itself is divisible by 9. that seems straightforward enough. so, i need to find the value of 
d
d such that the sum of the digits of 
2345
d
2345d is a multiple of 9.

let me write down the number: 2, 3, 4, 5, and 
d
d. so, the sum of the digits is 
2
+
3
+
4
+
5
+
d
2+3+4+5+d. let's calculate that sum without 
d
d first. 
2
+
3
=
5
2+3=5, plus 4 is 9, plus 5 is 14. so, the sum is 
14
+
d
14+d.

now, i need 
14
+
d
14+d to be a multiple of 9. that means 
14
+
d
14+d should be equal to 9 times some integer. let's think about what multiples of 9 are around 14. the multiples of 9 are 0, 9, 18, 27, and so on. since 
d
d is a single digit (0 through 9), 
14
+
d
14+d can range from 14 to 23. the multiples of 9 in that range are 18 and 27, but 27 is too big because 
14
+
d
=
27
14+d=27 would mean 
d
=
13
d=13, which isn't a single digit. so, the only possible multiple of 9 in that range is 18.

therefore, i need 
14
+
d
=
18
14+d=18. to find 
d
d, i subtract 14 from both sides: 
d
=
18
−
14
d=18−14, which means 
d
=
4
d=4.

let me double-check this. if 
d
=
4
d=4, then the number is 23454. let's add up the digits: 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 4 = 18, and 18 is indeed a multiple of 9. so, that seems correct.

wait a minute, is there any other possible value for 
d
d? let's see. the next multiple of 9 after 18 is 27, but as i said, 
d
=
13
d=13 isn't a single digit. and the previous multiple is 9, but 
14
+
d
=
9
14+d=9 would mean 
d
=
−
5
d=−5, which also isn't a digit. so, 4 is the only possible value for 
d
d.

just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other rule or property of multiples of 9 that i might have missed. for example, i recall that for a number to be divisible by 9, it's also divisible by 3, but since 9 is a multiple of 3, that doesn't add any new information here. i think the sum of digits being a multiple of 9 is the key here.

another thing i could do is to list out the possible values of 
d
d from 0 to 9 and see which one makes the sum a multiple of 9.

let's try that:

- if 
d
=
0
d=0: sum = 14 + 0 = 14 → not a multiple of 9

- 
d
=
1
d=1: 14 + 1 = 15 → not a multiple of 9

- 
d
=
2
d=2: 14 + 2 = 16 → not a multiple of 9

- 
d
=
3
d=3: 14 + 3 = 17 → not a multiple of 9

- 
d
=
4
d=4: 14 + 4 = 18 → yes, multiple of 9

- 
d
=
5
d=5: 14 + 5 = 19 → not a multiple of 9

- 
d
=
6
d=6: 14 + 6 = 20 → not a multiple of 9

- 
d
=
7
d=7: 14 + 7 = 21 → 21 is a multiple of 3, but not of 9

- 
d
=
8
d=8: 14 + 8 = 22 → not a multiple of 9

- 
d
=
9
d=9: 14 + 9 = 23 → not a multiple of 9

so, indeed, only 
d
=
4
d=4 makes the sum a multiple of 9.

i think i'm confident with this answer. just to be extra sure, let's consider if there's any other property or exception that might apply here. for example, does this rule hold for all numbers, or are there any special cases?

from what i understand, the rule about the sum of digits being a multiple of 9 works for all integers, regardless of the number of digits. so, it should apply here without any issues.

also, since 
d
d is a single digit, and we've already checked all possibilities from 0 to 9, there's no need to consider any other values for 
d
d.

therefore, the digit 
d
d that makes 
2345
d
2345d a multiple of 9 is 4.

**final answer**

4
