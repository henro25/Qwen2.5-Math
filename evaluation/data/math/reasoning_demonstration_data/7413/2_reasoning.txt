Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: i need to find positive integers a and b such that (a + bi) squared equals 3 + 4i. okay, let's see how to approach this.

first, i know that when you square a complex number like a + bi, you use the formula (a + bi)^2 = a^2 + 2abi + (bi)^2. but wait, (bi)^2 is b^2 times i squared, and since i squared is -1, that becomes -b^2. so putting it all together, (a + bi)^2 = a^2 - b^2 + 2abi.

now, this is supposed to equal 3 + 4i. so, if i set the real parts equal and the imaginary parts equal, i get two equations:

1. a^2 - b^2 = 3 (this comes from the real parts)

2. 2ab = 4 (this comes from the imaginary parts)

okay, so i have a system of two equations with two variables, a and b. i need to solve for a and b, and they're positive integers.

let me look at the second equation first: 2ab = 4. i can simplify that by dividing both sides by 2, so ab = 2. since a and b are positive integers, i can list the possible pairs (a, b) that satisfy this equation.

the positive integer pairs where the product is 2 are:

- a = 1, b = 2

- a = 2, b = 1

that's it, because 2 and 1 are the only positive integers that multiply to 2.

now, i need to check which of these pairs satisfies the first equation: a^2 - b^2 = 3.

first, let's try a = 1 and b = 2:

a^2 - b^2 = 1^2 - 2^2 = 1 - 4 = -3

but the equation requires a^2 - b^2 = 3, and here it's -3, which is not equal to 3. so this pair doesn't work.

next, let's try a = 2 and b = 1:

a^2 - b^2 = 2^2 - 1^2 = 4 - 1 = 3

yes, that's exactly what we need! so a = 2 and b = 1 satisfy both equations.

therefore, the complex number we're looking for is 2 + i.

wait a minute, just to be thorough, are there any other positive integer solutions i might have missed? let's think about it.

the equation ab = 2 has only two positive integer solutions: (1,2) and (2,1), as i listed earlier. there are no other positive integers that multiply to 2. so, i don't think there are any other pairs to check.

also, just to double-check, let's plug a = 2 and b = 1 back into the original expression to make sure it works:

(a + bi)^2 = (2 + i)^2 = 2^2 + 2*2*1*i + (i)^2 = 4 + 4i + (-1) = 4 - 1 + 4i = 3 + 4i

yes, that matches the given expression. so, everything checks out.

i think that's the solution. a = 2 and b = 1, so a + bi = 2 + i.

**final answer**

2+iâ€‹
