Answer: Given that \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers such that \((a + bi)^2 = 3 + 4i\), we start by expanding \((a + bi)^2\):

\[
(a + bi)^2 = a^2 + 2abi + (bi)^2 = a^2 - b^2 + 2abi
\]

this must equal \(3 + 4i\), so we equate the real and imaginary parts:

1. \(a^2 - b^2 = 3\)
2. \(2ab = 4\)

from the second equation, we simplify:

\[
2ab = 4 \implies ab = 2
\]

the positive integer pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy \(ab = 2\) are:

- \(a = 1, b = 2\)
- \(a = 2, b = 1\)

we check these pairs in the first equation:

for \(a = 1, b = 2\):

\[
a^2 - b^2 = 1^2 - 2^2 = 1 - 4 = -3 \neq 3
\]

for \(a = 2, b = 1\):

\[
a^2 - b^2 = 2^2 - 1^2 = 4 - 1 = 3
\]

this pair satisfies both equations. therefore, the complex number is:

\[
a + bi = 2 + i
\]

thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{2+i}
\]
