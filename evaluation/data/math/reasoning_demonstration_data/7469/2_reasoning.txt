Reasoning: Let's dive into this problem. so, we have this piecewise function f(x), which is defined differently depending on whether x is greater than 4 or less than or equal to 4. specifically:

\[ f(x) = \begin{cases}

\sqrt{x} & \text{if } x > 4, \\

x^2 & \text{if } x \leq 4.

\end{cases} \]

and we need to find 
f
(
f
(
f
(
2
)
)
)
f(f(f(2))). that means we have to apply the function f three times, starting with the input 2.

first, i need to find f(2). since 2 is less than or equal to 4, i should use the second part of the piecewise function, which is 
x
2
x 
2
 . so, 
f
(
2
)
=
2
2
=
4
f(2)=2 
2
 =4.

now, i need to find f(f(2)), which is f(4). again, 4 is equal to 4, so i use the same part of the function: 
x
2
x 
2
 . therefore, 
f
(
4
)
=
4
2
=
16
f(4)=4 
2
 =16.

next, i need to find f(f(f(2))) = f(16). now, 16 is greater than 4, so i should use the first part of the piecewise function, which is 
x
x
​	
 . thus, 
f
(
16
)
=
16
=
4
f(16)= 
16
​	
 =4.

wait a minute, so after applying f three times, i end up back at 4. is that correct? let me double-check each step to make sure i didn't make a mistake.

first step: f(2). since 2 ≤ 4, f(2) = 2^2 = 4. that seems right.

second step: f(f(2)) = f(4). since 4 ≤ 4, f(4) = 4^2 = 16. okay, that looks good.

third step: f(f(f(2))) = f(16). now, 16 > 4, so f(16) = sqrt(16) = 4. hmm, back to 4 again.

wait, is there a pattern here? starting with 2, i get 4, then 16, then back to 4. if i were to apply f again, i'd get f(4) = 16, and so on. it seems like it's oscillating between 4 and 16.

but the problem only asks for f(f(f(2))), which is f(16) = 4. so, the final answer should be 4.

just to be thorough, maybe i should consider if there are any alternative interpretations of the function or if i misread the conditions.

the function is clearly defined with two cases: one for x > 4 and one for x ≤ 4. i applied the correct case each time based on the input value.

another thing to consider is whether the square root of 16 is indeed 4. yes, the principal square root of 16 is 4.

also, squaring 2 gives 4, and squaring 4 gives 16, as i did.

so, everything checks out. the answer is 4.

**final answer**

4
