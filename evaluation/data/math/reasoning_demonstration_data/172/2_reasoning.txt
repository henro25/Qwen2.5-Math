Reasoning: So i need to evaluate the infinite sum 
∑
n
=
1
∞
n
n
4
+
4
∑ 
n=1
∞
​
  
n 
4
 +4
n
​
 . hmm, infinite series can be tricky, but let's see what i can do here.

first, i should check if this series converges. to do that, maybe i can use the comparison test or the ratio test. let's try the ratio test. the ratio test says that for a series 
∑
a
n
∑a 
n
​
 , if 
lim
⁡
n
→
∞
∣
a
n
+
1
a
n
∣
=
l
lim 
n→∞
​
  
​
  
a 
n
​
 
a 
n+1
​
 
​
  
​
 =l, then:

- if 
l
<
1
l<1, the series converges absolutely.

- if 
l
>
1
l>1, the series diverges.

- if 
l
=
1
l=1, the test is inconclusive.

so, let's compute the limit:

lim
⁡
n
→
∞
∣
(
n
+
1
)
/
(
(
n
+
1
)
4
+
4
)
n
/
(
n
4
+
4
)
∣
=
lim
⁡
n
→
∞
∣
(
n
+
1
)
(
n
4
+
4
)
n
(
(
n
+
1
)
4
+
4
)
∣
n→∞
lim
​
  
​
  
n/(n 
4
 +4)
(n+1)/((n+1) 
4
 +4)
​
  
​
 = 
n→∞
lim
​
  
​
  
n((n+1) 
4
 +4)
(n+1)(n 
4
 +4)
​
  
​
 
this looks messy. maybe there's a better way to check for convergence. alternatively, i can consider the behavior of the general term as 
n
n approaches infinity.

the general term is:

a
n
=
n
n
4
+
4
=
n
n
4
(
1
+
4
n
4
)
=
1
n
3
(
1
+
4
n
4
)
≈
1
n
3
a 
n
​
 = 
n 
4
 +4
n
​
 = 
n 
4
 (1+ 
n 
4
 
4
​
 )
n
​
 = 
n 
3
 (1+ 
n 
4
 
4
​
 )
1
​
 ≈ 
n 
3
 
1
​
 
since 
∑
1
n
3
∑ 
n 
3
 
1
​
  is a convergent p-series (with 
p
=
3
>
1
p=3>1), by the comparison test, our original series converges.

alright, so the series converges. now, the real challenge is to find its sum.

looking at the general term, 
n
n
4
+
4
n 
4
 +4
n
​
 , i wonder if i can simplify this expression somehow. maybe factor the denominator?

let me try to factor 
n
4
+
4
n 
4
 +4. i recall that 
n
4
+
4
n 
4
 +4 can be factored using the sum of squares formula or perhaps by recognizing it as a biquadratic.

wait, actually, 
n
4
+
4
=
n
4
+
4
n
2
+
4
−
4
n
2
=
(
n
2
+
2
)
2
−
(
2
n
)
2
=
(
n
2
+
2
n
+
2
)
(
n
2
−
2
n
+
2
)
n 
4
 +4=n 
4
 +4n 
2
 +4−4n 
2
 =(n 
2
 +2) 
2
 −(2n) 
2
 =(n 
2
 +2n+2)(n 
2
 −2n+2). oh, that's a difference of squares!

so,

n
4
+
4
=
(
n
2
+
2
n
+
2
)
(
n
2
−
2
n
+
2
)
n 
4
 +4=(n 
2
 +2n+2)(n 
2
 −2n+2)
great, now i can write the general term as:

n
(
n
2
+
2
n
+
2
)
(
n
2
−
2
n
+
2
)
(n 
2
 +2n+2)(n 
2
 −2n+2)
n
​
 
maybe i can use partial fractions to decompose this.

let me set:

n
(
n
2
+
2
n
+
2
)
(
n
2
−
2
n
+
2
)
=
a
n
+
b
n
2
+
2
n
+
2
+
c
n
+
d
n
2
−
2
n
+
2
(n 
2
 +2n+2)(n 
2
 −2n+2)
n
​
 = 
n 
2
 +2n+2
an+b
​
 + 
n 
2
 −2n+2
cn+d
​
 
now, i need to solve for 
a
a, 
b
b, 
c
c, and 
d
d.

multiplying both sides by 
(
n
2
+
2
n
+
2
)
(
n
2
−
2
n
+
2
)
(n 
2
 +2n+2)(n 
2
 −2n+2), i get:

n
=
(
a
n
+
b
)
(
n
2
−
2
n
+
2
)
+
(
c
n
+
d
)
(
n
2
+
2
n
+
2
)
n=(an+b)(n 
2
 −2n+2)+(cn+d)(n 
2
 +2n+2)
let me expand the right side:

n
=
a
n
3
−
2
a
n
2
+
2
a
n
+
b
n

2
 +2an+bn 
2
 −2bn+2b+cn

 +2cn 
2
 +2cn+dn 
2
 +2dn+2d
combining like terms:

n
=
(
a
+
c
)
n
3
+
(
−
2
a
+
b
+
2
c

)
n

(

−

)
n

(

d
)
n=(a+c)n 
3
 +(−2a+b+2c+d)n 
2
 +(2a−2b+2c+2d)n+(2b+2d)
now, set this equal to the left side, which is 
n
n. so, we can equate coefficients:

1. for 
n
3
n 
3
 : 
a
+
c
=
0
a+c=0

2. for 
n
2
n 
2
 : 
−
2
a
+
b
+
2
c
+
d
=
0
−2a+b+2c+d=0

3. for 
n
n: 
2
a
−
2
b
+
2
c
+
2
d
=
1
2a−2b+2c+2d=1

4. for the constant term: 
2
b
+
2
d
=
0
2b+2d=0

now, i have a system of equations to solve:

1. 
a
+
c
=
0
a+c=0

2. 
−
2
a
+
b
+
2
c
+
d
=
0
−2a+b+2c+d=0

3. 
2
a
−
2
b
+
2
c
+
2
d
=
1
2a−2b+2c+2d=1

4. 
2
b
+
2
d
=
0
2b+2d=0

let me solve this step by step.

from equation 1: 
c
=
−
a
c=−a

from equation 4: 
2
b
+
2
d
=
0
  
⟹
  
b
=
−
d
2b+2d=0⟹b=−d

now, substitute 
c
=
−
a
c=−a and 
b
=
−
d
b=−d into equation 2:

−
2
a
+
(
−
d
)
+
2
(
−
a
)
+
d
=
0
−2a+(−d)+2(−a)+d=0

simplify:

−
2
a
−
d
−
2
a
+
d
=
0
  
⟹
  
−
4
a
=
0
  
⟹
  
a
=
0
−2a−d−2a+d=0⟹−4a=0⟹a=0

then, 
c
=
−
a
=
0
c=−a=0

and 
b
=
−
d
b=−d

now, substitute 
a
=
0
a=0, 
c
=
0
c=0, and 
b
=
−
d
b=−d into equation 3:

2
(
0
)
−
2
(
−
d
)
+
2
(
0
)
+
2
d
=
1
  
⟹
  
2
d
+
2
d
=
1
  
⟹
  
4
d
=
1
  
⟹
  
d
=
1
4
2(0)−2(−d)+2(0)+2d=1⟹2d+2d=1⟹4d=1⟹d= 
4
1
​
 

therefore, 
b
=
−
d
=
−
1
4
b=−d=− 
4

​
 

so, the partial fractions decomposition is:

simplify:

​
 
now, the sum becomes:

∑

∑

​
 (

​
 − 
n

​
 )
let me see if this telescopes or if there's a pattern i can exploit.

first, consider the denominators:

n
2
−
2
n
+
2
=
(
n
−
1
)
2
+
1
n 
2
 −2n+2=(n−1) 
2
 +1

n
2
+
2
n
+
2
=
(
n
+
1
)
2
+
1
n 
2
 +2n+2=(n+1) 
2
 +1

so, i can write:

∑
n
=
1
∞
n
n
4
+
4
=
1
4
∑
n
=
1
∞
(
1
(
n
−

)
2
+
1
−
1
(
n
+

)
2
+
1
)
n=1
∑
∞
​
  
n 
4
 +4
n
​
 = 
4
1
​
  
n=1
∑
∞
​
 ( 
(n−1) 
2
 +1
1
​
 − 
(n+1) 
2
 +1
1
​
 )
this looks like it might telescope if i shift the index.

let me make a substitution for the first term. let 
m
=
n
−
1
m=n−1, then when 
n
=
1
n=1, 
m
=
0
m=0. so:

∑
n
=
1
∞
1
(
n
−
1
)
2
+
1
=
∑
m
=
0
∞
1
m
2
+
1
n=1
∑
∞
​
  
(n−1) 
2
 +1
1
​
 = 
m=0
∑
∞
​
  
m 
2
 +1
1
​
 
similarly, for the second term, let 
k
=
n
+
1
k=n+1, then when 
n
=
1
n=1, 
k
=
2
k=2:

∑
n
=
1
∞
1
(
n
+
1
)
2
+
1
=
∑
k
=
2
∞
1
k
2
+
1
n=1
∑
∞
​
  
(n+1) 
2
 +1
1
​
 = 
k=2
∑
∞
​
  
k 
2
 +1
1
​
 
so, putting it back together:

∑
n
=
1
∞
n
n
4
+
4
=
1
4
(
∑
m
=
0
∞
1
m
2
+

−
∑
k
=
2
∞
1
k
2
+

)
n=1
∑
∞
​
  
n 
4

n
​
 =

​
 ( 
m=0
∑
∞
​
  
m 
2
 +1
1
​
 − 
k=2
∑
∞
​
  
k 
2
 +1
1
​
 )
notice that the second sum starts at 
k
=
2
k=2, while the first sum starts at 
m
=
0
m=0. so, the difference between these two sums is the terms from 
m
=
0
m=0 and 
m
=
1
m=1:

∑
m
=
0
∞
1
m
2
+
1
−
∑
k
=
2

1
k
2
+

=
1
0
2
+
1
+
1

2

=

=

m=0
∑

​
  
m 
2

​
 − 
k=2
∑
∞
​
  
k 
2

​
 =

​
 +

2

​
 =1+

​
 =

​
 
therefore:

∑
n
=
1

n
n
4

=

=

so, the sum converges to
