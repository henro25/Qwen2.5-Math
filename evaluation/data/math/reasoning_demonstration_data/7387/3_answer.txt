Answer: We are given that rows seat either 7 or 8 people, and 46 people are to be seated with every seat occupied. We need to determine how many rows seat exactly 8 people.

Let:
- \( x \) = number of rows with 7 seats
- \( y \) = number of rows with 8 seats

The total number of seats is:
\[
7x + 8y = 46
\]

We need integer solutions for \( x \) and \( y \). Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{46 - 8y}{7}
\]

For \( x \) to be an integer, \( 46 - 8y \) must be divisible by 7. Using modular arithmetic:
\[
46 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}, \quad 8y \equiv y \pmod{7}
\]
\[
4 - y \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \quad \Rightarrow \quad y \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]

Thus, \( y = 4 \) is the smallest non-negative integer solution. Substituting \( y = 4 \) back into the equation:
\[
x = \frac{46 - 8(4)}{7} = \frac{14}{7} = 2
\]

Verification:
\[
7(2) + 8(4) = 14 + 32 = 46
\]

Therefore, there are **4 rows** that seat exactly 8 people.
