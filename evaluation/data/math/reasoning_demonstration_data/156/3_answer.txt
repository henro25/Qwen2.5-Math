Answer: To find all solutions to \( f^{-1}(x) = 0 \) for the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{ax + b} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are nonzero constants, we first need to determine the inverse function \( f^{-1}(x) \).

starting with the equation:
\[ y = \frac{1}{ax + b} \]

we solve for \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
\[ y(ax + b) = 1 \]
\[ axy + by = 1 \]
\[ axy = 1 - by \]
\[ x = \frac{1 - by}{ay} \]

thus, the inverse function is:
\[ f^{-1}(y) = \frac{1 - by}{ay} \]

we need to find \( x \) such that \( f^{-1}(x) = 0 \):
\[ \frac{1 - bx}{ax} = 0 \]

a fraction is zero when its numerator is zero:
\[ 1 - bx = 0 \]
\[ bx = 1 \]
\[ x = \frac{1}{b} \]

we verify that the denominator \( ax \) is not zero:
\[ a \left( \frac{1}{b} \right) = \frac{a}{b} \neq 0 \]

therefore, the solution to \( f^{-1}(x) = 0 \) is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{1}{b}} \]
