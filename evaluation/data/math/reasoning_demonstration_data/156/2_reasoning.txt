Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: given the function f(x) = 1/(a x + b), where a and b are nonzero constants, i need to find all solutions to f^{-1}(x) = 0. and i need to express the answer in terms of a and b. okay, first things first, i need to understand what f^{-1}(x) means. that's the inverse function of f, right? so, f^{-1}(x) is the function that "undoes" f. in other words, if y = f(x), then x = f^{-1}(y).

so, to find f^{-1}(x), i need to solve for x in terms of y, where y = f(x). let's set it up:

y = 1/(a x + b)

now, i need to solve this equation for x in terms of y. that will give me x = f^{-1}(y).

alright, starting with y = 1/(a x + b), i can multiply both sides by (a x + b) to get rid of the denominator:

y(a x + b) = 1

then, distribute y:

a x y + b y = 1

now, i want to solve for x, so i'll isolate the term with x:

a x y = 1 - b y

then, divide both sides by (a y):

x = (1 - b y)/(a y)

so, f^{-1}(y) = (1 - b y)/(a y)

but the problem asks for f^{-1}(x) = 0, so i need to set this equal to zero and solve for x:

(1 - b x)/(a x) = 0

wait a minute, i think i need to be careful here. earlier, i had f^{-1}(y) = (1 - b y)/(a y), but the problem is f^{-1}(x) = 0. so, i should probably just use x instead of y in the inverse function.

so, f^{-1}(x) = (1 - b x)/(a x)

set that equal to zero:

(1 - b x)/(a x) = 0

now, a fraction is zero when its numerator is zero (provided the denominator is not zero). so, set the numerator equal to zero:

1 - b x = 0

then, solve for x:

b x = 1

x = 1/b

so, x = 1/b is the solution to f^{-1}(x) = 0.

wait, but i should make sure that the denominator a x is not zero. since a and b are nonzero constants, and x = 1/b, then a x = a*(1/b) = a/b, which is not zero because a and b are nonzero. so, that's fine.

let me check if this makes sense. if f^{-1}(x) = 0, then x should be f(0), because f^{-1}(f(0)) = 0.

wait, actually, if y = f(x), then x = f^{-1}(y). so, if f^{-1}(x) = 0, then x = f(0).

so, x = f(0) = 1/(a*0 + b) = 1/b.

yes, that matches what i got earlier.

therefore, the solution is x = 1/b.

hmm, that seems straightforward. is there anything i'm missing here? maybe i should consider if there are multiple solutions or if there are any restrictions.

well, since a and b are nonzero constants, and the denominator a x in f^{-1}(x) is a*(1/b) = a/b, which is not zero, there are no restrictions on x in this case.

also, since f is a one-to-one function (it's strictly decreasing if a and b have the same sign, and strictly increasing if they have opposite signs), its inverse should also be one-to-one, meaning there should be only one solution to f^{-1}(x) = 0.

so, i think x = 1/b is the only solution.

just to double-check, maybe i can plug x = 1/b back into f^{-1}(x) and see if it equals zero.

f^{-1}(1/b) = (1 - b*(1/b))/(a*(1/b)) = (1 - 1)/(a/b) = 0/(a/b) = 0

yes, that works.

alternatively, since f^{-1}(x) = 0 implies x = f(0), and f(0) = 1/b, that confirms it again.

so, the final answer is x = 1/b.
