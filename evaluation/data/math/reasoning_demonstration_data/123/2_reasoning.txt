Reasoning: So i have this problem here: i need to find the vector a minus three times vector b, where a is \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} and b is \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}. hmm, okay, vectors. i remember that to subtract vectors, you subtract their corresponding components. and if there's a scalar multiple involved, like the 3 times b, i need to multiply each component of b by that scalar before doing the subtraction.

let me write down what i need to find: a - 3b.

first, i should find 3b. that means multiplying each component of b by 3.

so, b is \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}, so 3b would be:

3 * 4 = 12

3 * 2 = 6

3 * (-1) = -3

so, 3b is \begin{pmatrix} 12 \\ 6 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}

now, i need to subtract this from vector a.

a is \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, and 3b is \begin{pmatrix} 12 \\ 6 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}, so a - 3b should be:

first component: -7 - 12 = -19

second component: 0 - 6 = -6

third component: 1 - (-3) = 1 + 3 = 4

so, a - 3b is \begin{pmatrix} -19 \\ -6 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}

wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

first, calculating 3b:

3 * 4 = 12 (that's correct)

3 * 2 = 6 (correct)

3 * (-1) = -3 (correct)

now, subtracting 3b from a:

-7 - 12 = -19 (correct)

0 - 6 = -6 (correct)

1 - (-3) = 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)

everything seems to check out. i don't think i missed anything here.

alternatively, just to be thorough, maybe i can represent this in another way or see if there's another method to approach this problem.

well, another way to look at vector operations is to think of them component-wise, which is essentially what i did. since vectors are added or subtracted by their corresponding components, and scalar multiplication distributes over each component, my approach is valid.

i could also recall that in vector spaces, scalar multiplication and vector addition/subtraction are linear operations, so my calculations should hold true.

another thing i could consider is if there's a geometric interpretation of this operation, but i don't think that's necessary for this problem. the question just asks for the vector a - 3b, and i've calculated it step by step.

i guess i can also write it out in a more formal mathematical notation to ensure clarity.

given:

a = \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}

b = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}

then:

a - 3b = \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 2 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -7 - 12 \\ 0 - 6 \\ 1 - (-3) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -19 \\ -6 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}

yes, that looks correct.

i don't think there's any need to go further into matrix operations or anything like that, since this is just basic vector arithmetic.

maybe to reinforce my understanding, i can consider what this vector represents.

if a and b are vectors in three-dimensional space, then a - 3b is another vector in that space, obtained by scaling b by 3 and then subtracting it from a.

but again, the problem doesn't ask for any interpretation, just the calculation.

alright, i'm confident that a - 3b is \begin{pmatrix} -19 \\ -6 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
