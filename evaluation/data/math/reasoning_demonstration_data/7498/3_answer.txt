Answer: **Step 1:** Calculate the total sum of the original 10 numbers.

- Average = 85
- Number of values = 10
- Total sum = 85 * 10 = 850

**Step 2:** Subtract the removed numbers (70 and 76) from the total sum.

- Sum of removed numbers = 70 + 76 = 146
- New sum = 850 - 146 = 704

**Step 3:** Determine the number of remaining numbers.

- Original count = 10
- Numbers removed = 2
- Remaining numbers = 10 - 2 = 8

**Step 4:** Calculate the new average.

- New average = New sum / Remaining numbers
- New average = 704 / 8 = 88

**Answer:** The average of the remaining numbers is 88.
