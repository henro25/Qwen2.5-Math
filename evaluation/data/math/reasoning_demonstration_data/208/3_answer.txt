Answer: To determine the largest value of \( x \) such that the expression \(\dfrac{x+1}{8x^2 - 65x + 8}\) is not defined, we need to find the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero.

the denominator is \( 8x^2 - 65x + 8 \). we solve the quadratic equation:

\[ 8x^2 - 65x + 8 = 0 \]

using the quadratic formula:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

where \( a = 8 \), \( b = -65 \), and \( c = 8 \):

\[ x = \frac{65 \pm \sqrt{4225 - 256}}{16} \]
\[ x = \frac{65 \pm \sqrt{3969}}{16} \]
\[ x = \frac{65 \pm 63}{16} \]

this gives two solutions:

1. \( x = \frac{65 + 63}{16} = \frac{128}{16} = 8 \)
2. \( x = \frac{65 - 63}{16} = \frac{2}{16} = \frac{1}{8} \)

the expression is not defined at \( x = 8 \) and \( x = \frac{1}{8} \). the largest value among these is 8.

therefore, the largest value of \( x \) such that the expression is not defined is:

\[\boxed{8}\]
