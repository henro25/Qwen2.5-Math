Reasoning: 
So i have this problem here: i need to find the largest value of 
x
x such that the expression 
x
+
1
8
x
2
−
65
x
+
8
8x 
2
 −65x+8
x+1
​
  is not defined. hmm, okay, let's break this down.

first off, an expression like this is a rational function, which means it's a fraction where both the numerator and the denominator are polynomials. the expression is not defined when the denominator is zero because division by zero is undefined in mathematics. so, i need to find the values of 
x
x that make the denominator equal to zero.

the denominator is 
8
x
2
−
65
x
+
8
8x 
2
 −65x+8. to find when this equals zero, i need to solve the quadratic equation:

8
x
2
−
65
x
+
8
=
0
8x 
2
 −65x+8=0
quadratic equations can be solved using several methods: factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula. let me see if this quadratic can be factored easily.

i need two numbers that multiply to 
8
×
8
=
64
8×8=64 and add up to -65. that seems tricky because 64 isn't a multiple of 65, and the numbers would have to be quite large and specific. maybe factoring isn't the best approach here.

alternatively, i can use the quadratic formula, which is:

x
=
−
b
±
b
2
−
4
a
c
2
a
x= 
2a
−b± 
b 
2
 −4ac
​
 
​
 
where 
a
=
8
a=8, 
b
=
−
65
b=−65, and 
c
=
8
c=8.

plugging in these values:

x
=
−
(
−
65
)
±
(
−
65
)
2
−

8
x= 
2×8
−(−65)± 
(−65)

 −4×8×8
​
 
​
 
x
=
65
±
4225
−
256
16
x= 
16
65± 
4225−256
​
 
​
 
x
=
65
±
3969
16
x= 
16
65± 
3969
​
 
​
 
now, what is the square root of 3969? i know that 63 squared is 3969 because 60 squared is 3600 and 3 squared is 9, and cross terms give the remaining 360 + 9 = 369, but that's not quite right. wait, no:

actually, 
6
3
2
=
63
×
63
63 
2
 =63×63. let's calculate that:

6
0
2
=
3600
60 
2
 =3600

3
×
60
×
2
=
360
3×60×2=360

3
2
=
9
3 
2
 =9

so, 
6
3
2
=
3600
+
360
+
9
=
3969
63 
2
 =3600+360+9=3969. got it.

so,

x
=
65
±
63
16
x= 
16
65±63
​
 
this gives two solutions:

1. 
x
=
65
+
63
16
=
128
16
=
8
x= 
16
65+63
​
 = 
16
128
​
 =8

2. 
x
=
65
−
63
16
=
2
16
=
1
8
x= 
16
65−63
​
 = 
16
2
​
 = 
8
1
​
 

so, the denominator is zero when 
x
=
8
x=8 or 
x
=
1
8
x= 
8
1
​
 . that means the expression is not defined at these two points.

the problem asks for the largest value of 
x
x where the expression is not defined. between 8 and 
1
8
8
1
​
 , 8 is definitely larger.

wait a second, is there anything else i need to consider? like, are there any restrictions on 
x
x besides the denominator being zero? in this case, the numerator is 
x
+
1
x+1, but that doesn't affect the definition of the expression; it only affects the value of the expression.

also, i should make sure that there are no other points where the denominator could be zero. for example, if there was a common factor in the numerator and denominator that could be canceled out, that might indicate a hole in the graph, but since the numerator is 
x
+
1
x+1, and the denominator is 
8
x
2
−
65
x
+
8
8x 
2
 −65x+8, there doesn't seem to be a common factor.

let me double-check by trying to factor the denominator:

8
x
2
−
65
x
+
8
8x 
2
 −65x+8

looking for two numbers that multiply to 
8
×
8
=
64
8×8=64 and add up to -65. as i thought earlier, this seems unlikely because 64 and -65 are close but not exact. also, since we already solved the quadratic and found the roots, i can be confident in those solutions.

therefore, the expression is not defined at 
x
=
8
x=8 and 
x
=
1
8
x= 
8
1
​
 , and the largest of these is 8.

**final answer**

8
8
