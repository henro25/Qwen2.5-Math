Reasoning: So i have this problem about an ellipse. the endpoints of the major axis are given as (-11,4) and (9,4), and the ellipse also passes through the point (7,7). i need to find the area of the ellipse. hmm, let's see how to approach this.

first, i recall that the general equation of an ellipse is:

(
x
−
h
)
2
a
2
+
(
y
−
k
)
2
b
2
=
1
a 
2
 
(x−h) 
2
 
​
 + 
b 
2
 
(y−k) 
2
 
​
 =1
where (h,k) is the center of the ellipse, a is the semi-major axis, and b is the semi-minor axis. since the major axis endpoints are (-11,4) and (9,4), i can find the center by finding the midpoint of these two points.

the midpoint formula is:

(
x
1
+
x
2
2
,
y
1
+
y
2
2
)
( 
2
x 
1
​
 +x 
2
​
 
​
 , 
2
y 
1
​
 +y 
2
​
 
​
 )
so, plugging in the coordinates:

h
=
−
11
+
9
2
=
−
2
2
=
−

h= 
2
−11+9
​
 = 
2
−2
​
 =−1
k
=
4
+
4
2
=
8
2
=
4
k= 
2
4+4
​
 = 
2
8
​
 =4
so, the center of the ellipse is at (-1,4).

next, i need to find the length of the major axis. the distance between the endpoints is from x = -11 to x = 9, which is a horizontal distance. so, the length of the major axis is:

2
a
=
9
−
(
−
11
)
=
20
  
⟹
  
a
=
10
2a=9−(−11)=20⟹a=10
now, i need to find b, the semi-minor axis. i know that the ellipse passes through the point (7,7), so i can plug this point into the ellipse equation to solve for b.

first, write the equation with the known values:

(
x

(
−

)
)

(
y

(x+1) 
2
 
​
 + 
b 
2
 
(y−4) 
2
 
​
 =1
now, plug in (7,7):

(
7
+
1
)
2
100
+
(
7
−

)
2
b

b

=

​

simplify the fractions:

2

​
 + 
b

​

now, solve for

b

​

​

​
 
so,

9

=

25
  
⟹
  
b
2
=
25
  
⟹
  
b
=

b 
2
 
9
​
 =

​
 ⟹b 
2
 =25⟹b=5
now that i have both a and b, i can find the area of the ellipse. the area of an ellipse is given by:

area
=
π
a
b
area=πab
plugging in the values:

area
=
π
×
10
×
5
=
50
π
area=π×10×5=50π
so, the area of the ellipse is 
50
π
50π.

wait a minute, let me double-check everything to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

first, finding the center: midpoint of (-11,4) and (9,4). that seems correct, h = -1, k = 4.

length of major axis: from x = -11 to x = 9 is indeed 20, so a = 10.

using the point (7,7):

(
7

)

100
+
(
7
−

)
2
b

=

⟹

=

​

​

​

b
2
=

⟹
  
9
b
2
=
9
25
  
⟹
  
b
2
=
25
  
⟹
  
b
=
5
25
16
​
 + 
b

9
​
 =1⟹ 
b 
2
 
9
​
 = 
25
9
​
 ⟹b 
2
 =25⟹b=5
area = π * a * b = π * 10 * 5 = 50π

everything checks out. i think this is the correct answer.

**final answer**

50
π
50π
