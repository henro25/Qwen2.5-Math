Reasoning: So i need to figure out what 
(
7
8
)
3
⋅
(
7
8
)
−
3
( 
8
7
​
 ) 
3
 ⋅( 
8
7
​
 ) 
−3
  is. hmm, okay, exponents can be tricky, but i think i remember some rules about multiplying exponents with the same base.

first, i know that when you multiply two expressions with the same base, you can add the exponents. so, if i have 
a
m
⋅
a
n
a 
m
 ⋅a 
n
 , it should be 
a
m
+
n
a 
m+n
 . in this case, my base is 
7
8
8
7
​
 , and the exponents are 3 and -3.

so, applying that rule, it would be 
(
7
8
)
3
+
(
−
3
)
( 
8
7
​
 ) 
3+(−3)
 , which simplifies to 
(
7
8
)
0
( 
8
7
​
 ) 
0
 .

wait, anything raised to the power of 0 is 1, right? yeah, i think that's a general rule. so, 
(
7
8
)
0
=
1
( 
8
7
​
 ) 
0
 =1.

but let me double-check that. maybe i should expand it out to be sure.

let's calculate 
(
7
8
)
3
( 
8
7
​
 ) 
3
  first. that would be 
7
3
8
3
=
343
512
8 
3
 
7 
3
 
​
 = 
512
343
​
 .

then, 
(
7
8
)
−
3
( 
8
7
​
 ) 
−3
  is the same as 
(
8
7
)
3
( 
7
8
​
 ) 
3
 , because a negative exponent means the reciprocal. so, 
(
8
7
)
3
=
8
3
7
3
=
512
343
( 
7
8
​
 ) 
3
 = 
7 
3
 
8 
3
 
​
 = 
343
512
​
 .

now, multiplying those two results: 
343
512
⋅
512
343
512
343
​
 ⋅ 
343
512
​
 . the 343 and 512 should cancel each other out, right? so, it becomes 
343
⋅
512
512
⋅
343
=
1
512⋅343
343⋅512
​
 =1.

okay, that confirms my earlier thought. so, the answer should be 1.

wait a minute, what if the base was different? like, if it wasn't 
7
8
8
7
​
 , but something else? would the same rule apply?

let me think about that. suppose i have 
a
m
⋅
a
−
m
a 
m
 ⋅a 
−m
 , where 
a
a is any non-zero number. according to the exponent rules, that should be 
a
m
+
(
−
m
)
=
a
0
=
1
a 
m+(−m)
 =a 
0
 =1. so, it seems like it should always be 1, as long as the base isn't zero.

in this problem, the base is 
7
8
8
7
​
 , which is definitely not zero, so it holds true.

another way to look at it is using the definition of negative exponents. 
a
−
m
a 
−m
  is the same as 
1
a
m
a 
m
 
1
​
 . so, 
(
7
8
)
3
⋅
(
7
8
)
−
3
=
(
7
8
)
3
⋅
1
(
7
8
)
3
( 
8
7
​
 ) 
3
 ⋅( 
8
7
​
 ) 
−3
 =( 
8
7
​
 ) 
3
 ⋅ 
( 
8
7
​
 ) 
3
 
1
​
 .

that's like multiplying a number by its reciprocal, which should always give 1.

yeah, that makes sense. so, no matter how i approach it, i keep getting 1 as the answer.

is there any other way this could be interpreted? maybe if the exponents weren't the same?

wait, in this problem, the exponents are 3 and -3, which are negatives of each other. if they were different, say 3 and -2, then it wouldn't necessarily be 1.

for example, 
(
7
8
)
3
⋅
(
7
8
)
−
2
=
(
7
8
)
3
+
(
−
2
)
=
(
7
8
)
1
=
7
8
( 
8
7
​
 ) 
3
 ⋅( 
8
7
​
 ) 
−2
 =( 
8
7
​
 ) 
3+(−2)
 =( 
8
7
​
 ) 
1
 = 
8
7
​
 .

but in our original problem, since the exponents add up to zero, it's definitely 1.

i guess another thing to consider is if the base was a variable instead of a fraction. like, 
x
3
⋅
x
−
3
=
x
0
=
1
x 
3
 ⋅x 
−3
 =x 
0
 =1, as long as 
x
≠
0
x

=0.

so, the same principle applies here with 
x
=
7
8
x= 
8
7
​
 .

also, thinking about logarithms or other properties, but i don't think that's necessary here. it seems straightforward with the exponent rules.

let me just recap to make sure i haven't missed anything:

1. recognize that the bases are the same: 
7
8
8
7
​
 .

2. apply the exponent addition rule: 
a
m
⋅
a
n
=
a
m
+
n
a 
m
 ⋅a 
n
 =a 
m+n
 .

3. simplify the exponents: 
3
+
(
−
3
)
=
0
3+(−3)=0.

4. recall that any non-zero number to the power of 0 is 1.

5. confirm by expanding the exponents and canceling terms.

everything checks out, so i'm confident the answer is 1.

**final answer**
