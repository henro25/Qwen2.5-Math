Problem: Elmo makes $N$ sandwiches for a fundraiser. For each sandwich he uses $B$ globs of peanut butter at $4$ cents per glob and $J$ blobs of jam at $5$ cents per blob.  The cost of the peanut butter and jam to make all the sandwiches is $\$2.53$. Assume that  $B$, $J$, and $N$ are positive integers with $N>1$. What is the cost, in dollars, of the jam Elmo uses to make the sandwiches?
