Answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest integer multiple of 8 with all unique digits and then find the remainder when this number is divided by 1000.

1. **finding the largest three-digit number divisible by 8 with unique digits:**
   - the largest three-digit number with unique digits is 987, but it is not divisible by 8.
   - checking subsequent numbers, we find that 984 is divisible by 8 and has unique digits.

2. **constructing the largest number with unique digits ending in 984:**
   - we start with the largest possible digits and ensure no repetition.
   - the digits used in 984 are 9, 8, and 4.
   - the largest number formed by prepending unique digits to 984 is 7653210984.

3. **finding the remainder when this number is divided by 1000:**
   - the last three digits of 7653210984 are 984.
   - therefore, the remainder when 7653210984 is divided by 1000 is 984.

thus, the remainder when \( n \) is divided by 1000 is \(\boxed{984}\).
