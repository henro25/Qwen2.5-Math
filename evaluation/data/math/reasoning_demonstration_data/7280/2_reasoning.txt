Reasoning: Let's tackle this problem step by step. so, we need to find the greatest integer that's a multiple of 8, and no two of its digits are the same. then, we have to find the remainder when this number is divided by 1000.

first, let's understand what it means for a number to be a multiple of 8. a number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number that's divisible by 8. that's a useful property because it means we can focus on the last three digits to check for divisibility by 8.

now, we're looking for the greatest such number with all unique digits. to maximize the number, we should use the largest possible digits starting from the left. that means using digits from 9 down to 0 without repeating any.

let's consider the largest possible number with unique digits. that would be 9876543210. but is this number divisible by 8? to check, we look at the last three digits, which are 10. wait, 10 is not three digits. actually, 10 is just two digits. so, i think i need to consider the last three digits as 010, but that's essentially 10, which isn't divisible by 8. so, 9876543210 isn't divisible by 8.

maybe i need to find the largest number less than 9876543210 that is a multiple of 8 and has all unique digits. this seems a bit broad. maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

let's consider that the number must be divisible by 8, and it should have the largest possible digits without repetition. since the divisibility by 8 depends on the last three digits, perhaps i should focus on finding the largest possible last three digits that form a number divisible by 8, with unique digits, and then prepend the largest possible unique digits to the front.

that sounds promising. so, let's first find the largest three-digit number with unique digits that's divisible by 8.

the largest three-digit number is 999, but we need unique digits. so, the largest three-digit number with unique digits is 987. is 987 divisible by 8? let's check: 987 ÷ 8 = 123.375. no, it's not divisible by 8.

next, 986. is 986 divisible by 8? 986 ÷ 8 = 123.25. nope.

985 ÷ 8 = 123.125. not divisible.

984 ÷ 8 = 123. so, 984 is divisible by 8. but does it have unique digits? 9, 8, 4 – all unique. great! so, 984 is a candidate for the last three digits.

but wait, is there a larger three-digit number with unique digits that's divisible by 8? let's check 984 + 8 = 992. is 992 divisible by 8? 992 ÷ 8 = 124. yes, but does it have unique digits? 9, 9, 2 – no, two 9's. not unique.

next, 992 + 8 = 1000, which is four digits. so, 984 seems to be the largest three-digit number with unique digits divisible by 8.

now, to make the largest possible number, we should prepend the largest possible unique digits to 984, ensuring that none of the digits repeat.

the digits we have in 984 are 9, 8, and 4. so, we can't use these digits again in the higher places.

the next largest digit available is 7. so, let's try 7984. but wait, 7 is not conflicting with 9, 8, or 4. is 7984 divisible by 8? to check, look at the last three digits, which are 984. we already know 984 is divisible by 8, so 7984 is divisible by 8.

but can we make a larger number by adding more digits in front?

yes, we can keep adding digits as long as they are unique and do not repeat any of the digits already used.

so, let's try adding another digit in front of 7984.

the next largest digit available is 6 (since 9,8,4,7 are already used). so, 67984.

is 67984 divisible by 8? again, check the last three digits: 984, which is divisible by 8.

can we add another digit? the next largest available digit is 5.

so, 567984.

again, last three digits are 984, divisible by 8.

continue this process until we've used all unique digits.

let's see, used digits so far: 5,6,7,9,8,4.

next available digit is 3, then 2, then 1, then 0.

so, 3567984.

check last three digits: 984, divisible by 8.

next, 23567984.

again, 984 at the end.

then, 123567984.

and finally, 0123567984, but leading zeros don't count, so 123567984.

wait, but in standard notation, we don't write numbers with leading zeros, so the largest possible number would be 9876543210, but as we saw earlier, that's not divisible by 8.

alternatively, maybe there are larger numbers than 123567984 that satisfy the conditions.

wait, perhaps i need to arrange the digits differently to get a larger number.

let me think differently.

instead of fixing the last three digits as 984, maybe there's a larger set of last three digits that are divisible by 8 with unique digits.

earlier, i thought 984 was the largest, but let's double-check.

what's the largest three-digit number with unique digits that's divisible by 8?

we had 992, but it repeats 9.

next is 984, which works.

is there any larger three-digit number with unique digits divisible by 8?

let me see: 984 + 8 = 992, which repeats 9.

984 - 8 = 976. is 976 divisible by 8? 976 ÷ 8 = 122. yes, but 984 is larger than 976.

so, 984 is still the largest three-digit number with unique digits divisible by 8.

so, perhaps i should stick with 984 as the last three digits.

now, to make the largest possible number, we need to add digits to the left of 984, using the largest available digits not already in 984, which are 7,6,5,3,2,1,0.

wait, in 984, we have 9,8,4. so, available digits are 7,6,5,3,2,1,0.

so, the next digit to the left should be the largest available, which is 7.

so, 7984.

then, add 6: 67984.

then, add 5: 567984.

then, add 3: 3567984.

then, add 2: 23567984.

then, add 1: 123567984.

and finally, add 0: 1235679840.

wait, but 1235679840 has a 0 at the end, which is fine, but does it have any repeating digits?

let's check: 1,2,3,5,6,7,9,8,4,0 – all unique. great.

is this number divisible by 8? since the last three digits are 984, which we know is divisible by 8, then yes.

so, 1235679840 is a candidate.

but is this the largest possible number with unique digits that's divisible by 8?

let me see if there's a larger number.

what if i arrange the digits differently to get a larger number?

for example, starting with 9, then 8, then 7, etc., but ensuring the last three digits are 984.

wait, if i have to have the last three digits as 984 to maintain divisibility by 8, then the rest of the digits have to be placed before that, using the largest available digits without repeating.

so, starting with 9, but 9 is already in 984, so i can't use another 9.

next is 8, which is also in 984.

then 7, which is not in 984.

so, 7984.

then 6: 67984.

then 5: 567984.

then 3: 3567984.

then 2: 23567984.

then 1: 123567984.

then 0: 1235679840.

is there a way to rearrange these digits to make a larger number?

well, if i try to place higher digits earlier, but the last three digits need to remain 984.

wait, perhaps i can rearrange the digits before 984 to be larger.

for example, instead of 1235679840, maybe 976543219840 or something, but that seems off.

wait, no, the last three digits have to be 984 for divisibility by 8.

so, the number must end with 984, and the preceding digits must be the largest possible unique digits not in 984.

so, 9 is already in 984, so can't use it again.

next is 8, also in 984.

next is 7, then 6, and so on.

so, the largest possible number would be 7653210984.

wait, but does that have unique digits?

let's check: 7,6,5,3,2,1,0,9,8,4 – all unique.

does it end with 984? no, it ends with 0984, which is 984 with a leading zero, but leading zeros don't count in standard notation.

so, 7653210984 is a 10-digit number ending with 984, with all unique digits.

is this larger than 1235679840? yes, it's larger.

wait, but 7653210984 is larger than 1235679840.

so, perhaps this is a better candidate.

but is there an even larger number?

wait, let's see.

to maximize the number, we want the highest possible digits on the left.

so, starting from the left, the first digit should be as large as possible, given the constraints.

we can't use 9 or 8 because they are in 984.

so, the first digit should be 7.

then, the next digit should be 6.

then, 5, and so on.

so, 76543210984.

but that's 11 digits, which isn't possible because we only have 10 unique digits (0-9).

wait, 0 is included, so 76543210984 is 11 digits, but 0 is included, making it 11 digits with unique digits.

wait, but 0 is a digit, so in standard numbers, leading zeros don't count, but trailing zeros do.

wait, no, trailing zeros are fine as long as they are part of the number.

but in this case, 76543210984 is a valid 11-digit number with unique digits, ending with 984.

wait a minute, but 0 is included, so it's allowed.

however, the largest possible number with unique digits is 9876543210, but that doesn't end with 984, and isn't divisible by 8.

so, perhaps 76543210984 is larger than 1235679840.

wait, but 76543210984 is a 11-digit number, while 1235679840 is a 10-digit number, so indeed, 76543210984 is larger.

but does it have unique digits? let's check: 7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,9,8,4 – oh, wait, there are two 4's. so, that's a mistake.

so, 76543210984 has two 4's, which violates the uniqueness condition.

so, that's invalid.

wait, maybe i miscalculated.

let's list out the digits: 7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,9,8,4.

yes, 4 appears twice.

so, that's not allowed.

i need to make sure all digits are unique.

so, let's try again.

starting with 7, then 6, then 5, then 3, then 2, then 1, then 0, then 9, then 8, then 4.

so, 7653210984.

that's a 10-digit number ending with 984, with all unique digits.

is there a way to arrange the digits to make a larger number?

well, if i try to place higher digits earlier, but making sure that the last three digits are 984.

so, let's see:

start with 7, then 6, then 5, then 4, but 4 is in 984, so can't use it again.

so, 7653210984 seems reasonable.

is there a way to make it larger?

what if i try 7654321984?

wait, but that repeats the 4 and 9.

wait, no, let's check: 7,6,5,4,3,2,1,9,8,4.

again, 4 repeats.

no good.

alternatively, 7653421984.

digits: 7,6,5,3,4,2,1,9,8,4 – still, 4 repeats.

not good.

alternatively, 7653241984.

digits: 7,6,5,3,2,4,1,9,8,4 – again, 4 repeats.

hmm.

maybe i need to avoid using 4 in the higher digits since it's already in the last three digits.

wait, no, the last three digits have to be 984, which includes 4.

so, i can't use 4 again in the higher digits.

so, in the higher digits, i can use 7,6,5,3,2,1,0,9,8, but not 9 or 8 again because they are in 984.

wait, 9 and 8 are in 984, so i can't use them again.

wait, no, 9 and 8 are in 984, but in 7653210984, 9 and 8 are not repeated because the last three digits are 984, and the higher digits are 7,6,5,3,2,1,0.

wait, but in 7653210984, the digits are 7,6,5,3,2,1,0,9,8,4 – all unique.

so, that seems correct.

is there a way to arrange these digits to get a larger number than 7653210984?

well, let's see.

to maximize the number, we should have the largest possible digits on the left.

so, starting with 7, then 6, then 5, then 3, then 2, then 1, then 0, then 9, then 8, then 4.

wait, but 9 and 8 are in the last three digits, so they can't be in the higher digits.

wait, no, in 7653210984, 9 and 8 are in the last three digits, but they are not in the higher digits.

wait, no, in 7653210984, the last three digits are 984, and the higher digits are 7,6,5,3,2,1,0.

so, 9 and 8 are only in the last three digits.

so, that seems correct.

but perhaps i can rearrange the higher digits to make a larger number.

for example, 7653219840.

wait, but in this case, the last three digits would be 9840, but 9840 is a four-digit number, and we need the last three digits to be 984 for divisibility by 8.

wait, no, if i have 7653219840, the last three digits are 840, which is different from 984.

so, that won't work.

i need the number to end with 984 to ensure divisibility by 8.

so, perhaps 7653210984 is the largest possible number with unique digits ending with 984.

is there a way to make it larger?

what if i try 7654321984, but as we saw earlier, that repeats the 4.

so, no.

alternatively, 7653421984, which also repeats the 4.

not good.

so, maybe 7653241984, but again, repeats the 4.

same issue.

alternatively, 7653214984, but that has a 4 and 9 in the higher digits, but 4 is only in the last three digits, so let's check the digits: 7,6,5,3,2,1,4,9,8,4 – repeats 4.

not allowed.

alternatively, 7653210984 seems to be the largest possible number with unique digits ending with 984.

so, perhaps that's our n.

now, the problem asks for the remainder when n is divided by 1000.

well, dividing by 1000 and taking the remainder is the same as looking at the last three digits of the number.

since n ends with 984, the remainder when n is divided by 1000 should be 984.

but let's verify that.

if n = 7653210984, then n ÷ 1000 = 7653210 with a remainder of 984.

yes, that checks out.

alternatively, if n were 1235679840, the remainder would be 840, but 7653210984 is larger and ends with 984, so 984 is the remainder.

therefore, the remainder is 984.

**final answer**

984
