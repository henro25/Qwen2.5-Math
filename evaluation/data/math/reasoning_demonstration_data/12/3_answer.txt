Answer: To solve the equation \( |n + 6| = 2 - n \), we consider two cases based on the definition of absolute value.

**Case 1: \( n + 6 \geq 0 \) (i.e., \( n \geq -6 \))**

In this case, \( |n + 6| = n + 6 \), so the equation becomes:
\[
n + 6 = 2 - n
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
2n + 6 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2n = -4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n = -2
\]
Since \( -2 \geq -6 \), this solution is valid.

**Case 2: \( n + 6 < 0 \) (i.e., \( n < -6 \))**

In this case, \( |n + 6| = -(n + 6) = -n - 6 \), so the equation becomes:
\[
-n - 6 = 2 - n
\]
Simplifying:
\[
-n - 6 = 2 - n
\]
Adding \( n \) to both sides:
\[
-6 = 2
\]
This is a contradiction, so there are no solutions in this case.

Finally, we check the solution \( n = -2 \) in the original equation:
\[
|(-2) + 6| = |4| = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad 2 - (-2) = 4
\]
Both sides are equal, confirming that \( n = -2 \) is correct.

Thus, the solution is:
\[
\boxed{-2}
\]
