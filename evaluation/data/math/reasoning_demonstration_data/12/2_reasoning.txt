Reasoning: Okay, so I have this equation to solve: |n + 6| = 2 - n. Alright, absolute value equations can be tricky, but I think I can handle this. Let me see... Absolute value means that whatever is inside the bars, it's always positive or zero, right? So |n + 6| is always going to be positive or zero, no matter what n is.

Now, the right side of the equation is 2 - n. That could be positive or negative depending on what n is. So I need to consider different cases based on the value of n.

First, I should probably think about what n could be. Maybe I can consider when n + 6 is positive and when it's negative.

Case 1: n + 6 is positive or zero. That means n + 6 ≥ 0, which simplifies to n ≥ -6.

In this case, |n + 6| = n + 6. So the equation becomes n + 6 = 2 - n. Let me solve that:

n + 6 = 2 - n

Add n to both sides: 2n + 6 = 2

Subtract 6 from both sides: 2n = -4

Divide by 2: n = -2

Now, I need to check if this solution fits the condition of this case, which is n ≥ -6. -2 is greater than -6, so it works.

Case 2: n + 6 is negative. That means n + 6 < 0, which simplifies to n < -6.

In this case, |n + 6| = -(n + 6) = -n - 6. So the equation becomes -n - 6 = 2 - n.

Let's solve that:

-n - 6 = 2 - n

Add n to both sides: -6 = 2

Wait, that doesn't make sense. -6 equals 2? That can't be right. So there's no solution in this case.

So, the only solution is n = -2.

But wait, I should check if this solution actually satisfies the original equation. Let's plug n = -2 back into |n + 6| and 2 - n.

|(-2) + 6| = |4| = 4

2 - (-2) = 2 + 2 = 4

Yes, both sides are equal, so n = -2 is indeed a solution.

I think that's it. I don't see any other possible solutions based on the cases I considered.
