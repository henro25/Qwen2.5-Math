Answer: To find how many times the athlete's heart beats during a 26-mile race:

1. **Calculate the total time of the race:**
   - The athlete runs at a pace of 5 minutes per mile.
   - Total time = 5 minutes/mile × 26 miles = 130 minutes.

2. **Determine the total number of heartbeats:**
   - The heart beats 150 times per minute.
   - Total beats = 150 beats/minute × 130 minutes = 19,500 beats.

**Answer:** The athlete's heart beats 19,500 times during the race.
