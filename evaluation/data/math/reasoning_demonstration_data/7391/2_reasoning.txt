Reasoning: Alright, so I've got this problem here about an athlete's heart rate during a race. Let's see, the athlete's heart beats 150 times per minute while running, and they're running a 26-mile race at a pace of 5 minutes per mile. I need to find out how many times the heart beats during the entire race.

Okay, first things first, I need to figure out how long the race takes. If the athlete is running at 5 minutes per mile, and there are 26 miles, I can multiply 5 minutes by 26 to get the total time. Let's see, 5 times 26 is... um, 5 times 20 is 100, and 5 times 6 is 30, so 100 plus 30 is 130 minutes. So, the race takes 130 minutes.

Now, the heart beats 150 times each minute. To find the total number of beats during the race, I should multiply the heart rate by the total time in minutes. So, 150 beats per minute times 130 minutes. Let me calculate that. 150 times 100 is 15,000, and 150 times 30 is 4,500, so adding those together gives me 19,500 beats.

Wait a second, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's see, 5 minutes per mile times 26 miles is indeed 130 minutes. And 150 beats per minute times 130 minutes should be 19,500 beats. Yeah, that seems correct.

I guess another way to look at it is to convert the total time into hours if that makes it easier, but since the heart rate is already given per minute, minutes seem like the right unit to use here. If I were to convert 130 minutes into hours, it would be 2 hours and 10 minutes, but then I'd have to deal with fractions, which might complicate things unnecessarily.

Also, I should consider if there are any other factors that might affect the heart rate during the race, like changes in pace or effort, but the problem states an average of 150 beats per minute, so I think it's safe to assume that's constant throughout the race for this calculation.

Hmm, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by finding the beats per mile and then multiplying by the total miles, but that seems like it would involve the same steps. Let's try it: beats per minute is 150, and time per mile is 5 minutes, so beats per mile would be 150 times 5, which is 750 beats per mile. Then, 750 beats per mile times 26 miles is also 19,500 beats. Okay, that confirms my previous calculation.

I think I've got it. The athlete's heart beats 19,500 times during the race.
