Problem: John surveyed a group of people about their knowledge of rats. To the nearest tenth of a percent, he found that $86.8\%$ of the people surveyed thought rats carried diseases. Of the people who thought rats carried diseases, $45.7\%$ said that rats frequently carried rabies. Since rats do not frequently carry rabies, these 21 people were mistaken. How many total people did John survey?
