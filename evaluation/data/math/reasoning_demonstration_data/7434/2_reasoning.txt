Reasoning: So i have this problem here: "the product of the positive integer divisors of a positive integer 
n
n is 729. find 
n
n." okay, let's try to figure this out step by step.

first, i need to understand what it means by "the product of the positive integer divisors of 
n
n." so, if 
n
n is a positive integer, its positive divisors are all the integers that divide 
n
n without leaving a remainder. for example, if 
n
=
6
n=6, its positive divisors are 1, 2, 3, and 6.

now, the product of these divisors would be 
1
×
2
×
3
×
6
=
36
1×2×3×6=36. but in this problem, the product is given as 729, which is a much bigger number. so, i need to find a number 
n
n such that when i multiply all its positive divisors together, i get 729.

i recall that there is a formula for the product of the divisors of a number. let me try to remember it. i think it has something to do with the number of divisors and the number itself.

let me consider the number of positive divisors of 
n
n. if 
n
n has 
d
d positive divisors, then the product of the divisors is 
n
d
/
2
n 
d/2
 . wait, does that sound right?

let me test this with the example i had earlier. for 
n
=
6
n=6, the divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6, so 
d
=
4
d=4. according to the formula, the product should be 
6
4
/
2
=
6
2
=
36
6 
4/2
 =6 
2
 =36, which matches what i calculated earlier. okay, so the formula seems correct.

so, in general, if 
n
n has 
d
d positive divisors, then the product of its divisors is 
n
d
/
2
n 
d/2
 . given that this product is 729, i can set up the equation:

n
d
/
2
=
729
n 
d/2
 =729
now, i need to relate this to 
n
n and 
d
d. but i have two variables here, 
n
n and 
d
d, and only one equation. i need another relationship between 
n
n and 
d
d.

i know that if 
n
n is expressed in its prime factorization form, say 
n
=
p
1
a
1
p
2
a
2
…
p
k
a
k
n=p 
1
a 
1
​	
 
​	
 p 
2
a 
2
​	
 
​	
 …p 
k
a 
k
​	
 
​	
 , then the number of positive divisors 
d
d is given by:

d
=
(
a
1
+
1
)
(
a
2
+
1
)
…
(
a
k
+
1
)
d=(a 
1
​	
 +1)(a 
2
​	
 +1)…(a 
k
​	
 +1)
so, perhaps i can express 
d
d in terms of the exponents in the prime factorization of 
n
n, and then solve for 
n
n.

but that seems a bit complicated. maybe there's a simpler way. let's see.

first, note that 729 is a power of 3. specifically, 
729
=
3
6
729=3 
6
 . so, the equation becomes:

n
d
/
2
=
3
6
n 
d/2
 =3 
6
 
taking both sides to the power of 
2
/
d
2/d, we get:

n
=
(
3
6
)
2
/
d
=
3
12
/
d
n=(3 
6
 ) 
2/d
 =3 
12/d
 
since 
n
n is an integer, 
12
/
d
12/d must be an integer. therefore, 
d
d must be a divisor of 12.

so, possible values for 
d
d are the positive divisors of 12, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

now, for each possible 
d
d, i can find the corresponding 
n
n and check if it satisfies the original condition.

let's list them out:

1. if 
d
=
1
d=1, then 
n
=
3
12
/
1
=
3
12
n=3 
12/1
 =3 
12
 . but if 
d
=
1
d=1, that would mean 
n
n has only one positive divisor, which is only possible if 
n
=
1
n=1. but 
3
12
3 
12
  is much larger than 1, so this doesn't work.

2. if 
d
=
2
d=2, then 
n
=
3
12
/
2
=
3
6
=
729
n=3 
12/2
 =3 
6
 =729. now, does 729 have exactly 2 positive divisors? the divisors of 729 are 1 and 729, since it's a prime power (but wait, 729 is 
3
6
3 
6
 , which is not a prime itself, but its divisors are all powers of 3 from 
3
0
3 
0
  to 
3
6
3 
6
 , which are 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729. so there are 7 divisors, not 2. therefore, 
d
=
2
d=2 is not possible.

3. if 
d
=
3
d=3, then 
n
=
3
12
/
3
=
3
4
=
81
n=3 
12/3
 =3 
4
 =81. now, does 81 have exactly 3 positive divisors? let's list them: 1, 3, 9, 27, 81. that's 5 divisors, not 3. so, 
d
=
3
d=3 doesn't work.

4. if 
d
=
4
d=4, then 
n
=
3
12
/
4
=
3
3
=
27
n=3 
12/4
 =3 
3
 =27. now, what are the divisors of 27? 1, 3, 9, 27. that's 4 divisors, which matches 
d
=
4
d=4. so, this seems promising. now, let's check the product of the divisors: 
1
×
3
×
9
×
27
=
729
1×3×9×27=729. yes, that matches the given product. so, 
n
=
27
n=27 is a possible solution.

but let's check the remaining possibilities to ensure there are no other solutions.

5. if 
d
=
6
d=6, then 
n
=
3
12
/
6
=
3
2
=
9
n=3 
12/6
 =3 
2
 =9. now, what are the divisors of 9? 1, 3, 9. that's 3 divisors, not 6. so, 
d
=
6
d=6 doesn't work.

6. if 
d
=
12
d=12, then 
n
=
3
12
/
12
=
3
1
=
3
n=3 
12/12
 =3 
1
 =3. now, the divisors of 3 are 1 and 3, which is 2 divisors, not 12. so, 
d
=
12
d=12 doesn't work.

therefore, the only value of 
d
d that works is 
d
=
4
d=4, which gives 
n
=
27
n=27.

wait a minute, but i should make sure there are no other possible values of 
d
d that i might have missed. are there any other divisors of 12? let's see: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. that's all of them. so, indeed, only 
d
=
4
d=4 works, leading to 
n
=
27
n=27.

but just to be thorough, let's consider if 
n
n could be a different number that isn't a power of 3. for example, could 
n
n be a product of different primes?

suppose 
n
n has more than one distinct prime factor. then, its prime factorization would be something like 
n
=
p
a
q
b
n=p 
a
 q 
b
 , where 
p
p and 
q
q are distinct primes, and 
a
,
b
a,b are positive integers.

then, the number of divisors 
d
d would be 
(
a
+
1
)
(
b
+
1
)
(a+1)(b+1). and the product of the divisors would be 
n
d
/
2
n 
d/2
 , as before.

given that 
n
d
/
2
=
729
=
3
6
n 
d/2
 =729=3 
6
 , and 
n
n is a product of different primes, say 3 and another prime, then 
n
n would be divisible by 3 and another prime, making 
n
n at least 
3
×
2
=
6
3×2=6, and its divisors would include numbers other than powers of 3, which might complicate things.

let's try an example. suppose 
n
=
6
n=6, which has divisors 1, 2, 3, 6. the product is 
1
×
2
×
3
×
6
=
36
1×2×3×6=36, not 729.

another example: 
n
=
12
n=12, divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. product is 
1
×
2
×
3
×
4
×
6
×
12
=
1728
1×2×3×4×6×12=1728, which is 
1
2
6
/
2
=
1
2
3
=
1728
12 
6/2
 =12 
3
 =1728, not 729.

hmm, that doesn't help. what if 
n
n is a power of 3, like 
n
=
3
k
n=3 
k
 ? then, the number of divisors 
d
=
k
+
1
d=k+1, and the product of divisors is 
n
d
/
2
=
(
3
k
)
(
k
+
1
)
/
2
=
3
k
(
k
+
1
)
/
2
n 
d/2
 =(3 
k
 ) 
(k+1)/2
 =3 
k(k+1)/2
 . we set this equal to 729 = 3^6:

3
k
(
k
+
1
)
/
2
=
3
6
  
⟹
  
k
(
k
+
1
)
2
=
6
  
⟹
  
k
(
k
+
1
)
=
12
3 
k(k+1)/2
 =3 
6
 ⟹ 
2
k(k+1)
​	
 =6⟹k(k+1)=12
now, solving 
k
(
k
+
1
)
=
12
k(k+1)=12:

k
2
+
k
−
12
=
0
k 
2
 +k−12=0

using the quadratic formula:

k
=
−
1
±
1
+
48
2
=
−
1
±
49
2
=
−
1
±
7
2
k= 
2
−1± 
1+48
​	
 
​	
 = 
2
−1± 
49
​	
 
​	
 = 
2
−1±7
​	
 

so, 
k
=
3
k=3 or 
k
=
−
4
k=−4. since 
k
k must be positive, 
k
=
3
k=3. therefore, 
n
=
3
3
=
27
n=3 
3
 =27, which matches what i found earlier.

so, even if i assume 
n
n is a power of 3, i still get 
n
=
27
n=27.

is there any other way 
n
n could be constructed to satisfy this condition? for instance, could 
n
n be a perfect square or something like that? let's think about it.

if 
n
n is a perfect square, its number of divisors is odd, because one of the divisors is repeated (the square root). but in this case, we have 
d
=
4
d=4, which is even, so 
n
n is not a perfect square. wait, no, actually, for 
n
=
27
n=27, which is 
3
3
3 
3
 , the number of divisors is 4, which is even, as we saw earlier.

alternatively, maybe 
n
n is a cube or some other power. but in this case, 
n
=
27
n=27 is 
3
3
3 
3
 , which is a cube.

let me check if there's any other number that could satisfy 
n
d
/
2
=
729
n 
d/2
 =729, where 
d
d is the number of divisors of 
n
n.

suppose 
n
=
9
n=9, which is 
3
2
3 
2
 . the number of divisors is 
2
+
1
=
3
2+1=3, and the product of divisors is 
9
3
/
2
=
9
1.5
=
27
9 
3/2
 =9 
1.5
 =27, which is not 729.

if 
n
=
81
n=81, which is 
3
4
3 
4
 , the number of divisors is 
4
+
1
=
5
4+1=5, and the product is 
8
1
5
/
2
=
8
1
2.5
81 
5/2
 =81 
2.5
 , which is way bigger than 729.

if 
n
=
3
n=3, which is 
3
1
3 
1
 , the number of divisors is 
1
+
1
=
2
1+1=2, and the product is 
3
2
/
2
=
3
1
=
3
3 
2/2
 =3 
1
 =3, not 729.

so, indeed, only 
n
=
27
n=27 works.

wait a second, let's consider if 
n
n could be a product of different primes raised to certain powers.

suppose 
n
=
p
a
q
b
n=p 
a
 q 
b
 , where 
p
p and 
q
q are distinct primes.

then, the number of divisors is 
(
a
+
1
)
(
b
+
1
)
(a+1)(b+1), and the product of divisors is 
n
d
/
2
=
p
a
(
a
+
1
)
(
b
+
1
)
/
2
q
b
(
a
+
1
)
(
b
+
1
)
/
2
n 
d/2
 =p 
a(a+1)(b+1)/2
 q 
b(a+1)(b+1)/2
 . setting this equal to 729 = 
3
6
3 
6
 , we have to have both exponents of 
p
p and 
q
q equal to 0, which isn't possible unless 
a
=
b
=
0
a=b=0, but that would make 
n
=
1
n=1, which doesn't work. therefore, 
n
n cannot be a product of two distinct primes.

what if 
n
n is a product of three distinct primes? that would make things even more complicated, and the number of divisors would be even larger, making the product of divisors much larger than 729. so, that's not possible.

therefore, 
n
n must be a power of a single prime, and as we've seen, that leads us to 
n
=
27
n=27.

alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to solving this problem.

let me think about the properties of the product of divisors. the product of the divisors of 
n
n is also equal to 
n
d
/
2
n 
d/2
 , where 
d
d is the number of divisors, as we established earlier.

given that, and knowing that 
n
d
/
2
=
729
=
3
6
n 
d/2
 =729=3 
6
 , we can write:

n
d
/
2
=
3
6
n 
d/2
 =3 
6
 
taking natural logarithms on both sides:

d
2
ln
⁡
n
=
6
ln
⁡
3
2
d
​	
 lnn=6ln3
but i'm not sure if this helps me directly, as i still have two variables, 
n
n and 
d
d, and no straightforward way to solve for both.

maybe i can express 
d
d in terms of 
n
n, using the formula for the number of divisors.

if 
n
n is a prime power, say 
n
=
p
k
n=p 
k
 , then 
d
=
k
+
1
d=k+1, and the product of divisors is 
n
d
/
2
=
p
k
(
k
+
1
)
/
2
n 
d/2
 =p 
k(k+1)/2
 . setting this equal to 
3
6
3 
6
 , we have:

p
k
(
k
+
1
)
/
2
=
3
6
p 
k(k+1)/2
 =3 
6
 
this implies that 
p
=
3
p=3 and 
k
(
k
+
1
)
/
2
=
6
k(k+1)/2=6, which again leads to 
k
(
k
+
1
)
=
12
k(k+1)=12, and solving that gives 
k
=
3
k=3, so 
n
=
3
3
=
27
n=3 
3
 =27.

alternatively, if 
n
n has more than one distinct prime factor, things get more complicated, and as we saw earlier, it doesn't seem to work out.

so, in conclusion, the only possible value for 
n
n is 27.

wait, but let's check one more thing. is there any other number 
n
n that has 4 divisors and whose product of divisors is 729?

we already saw that 
n
=
27
n=27 works, but maybe there's another number with 4 divisors that satisfies this condition.

let's consider another number with exactly 4 divisors. for example, 
n
=
p
3
n=p 
3
 , where 
p
p is prime, has divisors 1, 
p
p, 
p
2
p 
2
 , and 
p
3
p 
3
 . the product is 
1
×
p
×
p
2
×
p
3
=
p
6
1×p×p 
2
 ×p 
3
 =p 
6
 . setting this equal to 729:

p
6
=
729
  
⟹
  
p
=
72
9
1
/
6
=
3
6
/
6
=
3
p 
6
 =729⟹p=729 
1/6
 =3 
6/6
 =3
so, 
p
=
3
p=3, and 
n
=
3
3
=
27
n=3 
3
 =27, which is the same answer as before.

another type of number with exactly 4 divisors is 
n
=
p
×
q
n=p×q, where 
p
p and 
q
q are distinct primes. in this case, the divisors are 1, 
p
p, 
q
q, and 
p
×
q
p×q. the product is 
1
×
p
×
q
×
p
q
=
p
2
q
2
1×p×q×pq=p 
2
 q 
2
 . setting this equal to 729:

p
2
q
2
=
729
  
⟹
  
(
p
q
)
2
=
729
  
⟹
  
p
q
=
27
p 
2
 q 
2
 =729⟹(pq) 
2
 =729⟹pq=27
now, since 
p
p and 
q
q are distinct primes, their product is 27. the only primes that multiply to 27 are 3 and 9, but 9 is not a prime. therefore, there are no such primes 
p
p and 
q
q, so this case doesn't yield a solution.

therefore, the only possible 
n
n is 27.

alternatively, if i consider 
n
=
1
n=1, which has only one divisor (1), the product is 1, not 729, so that doesn't work.

if 
n
=
2
n=2, which has divisors 1 and 2, the product is 2, not 729.

if 
n
=
4
n=4, which has divisors 1, 2, 4, the product is 8, not 729.

if 
n
=
5
n=5, divisors 1 and 5, product 5, not 729.

if 
n
=
7
n=7, divisors 1 and 7, product 7, not 729.

if 
n
=
8
n=8, divisors 1, 2, 4, 8, product 64, not 729.

if 
n
=
9
n=9, divisors 1, 3, 9, product 27, not 729.

if 
n
=
10
n=10, divisors 1, 2, 5, 10, product 100, not 729.

if 
n
=
12
n=12, divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, product 1728, which is larger than 729.

if 
n
=
15
n=15, divisors 1, 3, 5, 15, product 225, not 729.

if 
n
=
16
n=16, divisors 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, product 1024, not 729.

if 
n
=
18
n=18, divisors 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, product 
1
×
2
×
3
×
6
×
9
×
18
=
5832
1×2×3×6×9×18=5832, which is larger than 729.

if 
n
=
20
n=20, divisors 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, product 8000, which is much larger than 729.

it seems like only 
n
=
27
n=27 gives the product of divisors equal to 729.

therefore, the answer must be 
n
=
27
n=27.

**final answer**

27
