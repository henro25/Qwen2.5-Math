Answer: Given that the product of the positive integer divisors of a positive integer \( n \) is 729, we need to find \( n \).

first, we use the formula for the product of the divisors of \( n \), which is \( n^{d/2} \), where \( d \) is the number of divisors of \( n \). given that this product is 729, we have:

\[
n^{d/2} = 729
\]

since \( 729 = 3^6 \), we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
n^{d/2} = 3^6
\]

this implies:

\[
n = 3^{12/d}
\]

for \( n \) to be an integer, \( 12/d \) must be an integer, so \( d \) must be a divisor of 12. the divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. we test each possible \( d \) to find the corresponding \( n \) and check if it satisfies the condition.

1. if \( d = 1 \), \( n = 3^{12/1} = 3^{12} \), which is not possible since \( n \) would have only one divisor.
2. if \( d = 2 \), \( n = 3^{12/2} = 3^6 = 729 \), but 729 has more than 2 divisors.
3. if \( d = 3 \), \( n = 3^{12/3} = 3^4 = 81 \), but 81 has more than 3 divisors.
4. if \( d = 4 \), \( n = 3^{12/4} = 3^3 = 27 \), and 27 has exactly 4 divisors (1, 3, 9, 27), and their product is \( 1 \times 3 \times 9 \times 27 = 729 \).

thus, \( n = 27 \) is a solution. checking other possible values of \( d \) (6 and 12) does not yield valid solutions.

therefore, the only possible value for \( n \) is:

\[
\boxed{27}
\]
