Answer: To find the first term of an infinite geometric series with a common ratio of \( \frac{1}{8} \) and a sum of 60, we use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:

\[
s = \frac{a}{1 - r}
\]

given \( s = 60 \) and \( r = \frac{1}{8} \), we substitute these values into the formula:

\[
60 = \frac{a}{1 - \frac{1}{8}}
\]

first, calculate \( 1 - \frac{1}{8} \):

\[
1 - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{8}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}
\]

so the equation becomes:

\[
60 = \frac{a}{\frac{7}{8}}
\]

to solve for \( a \), multiply both sides by \( \frac{7}{8} \):

\[
a = 60 \times \frac{7}{8}
\]

calculate the right-hand side:

\[
60 \times \frac{7}{8} = 60 \times 0.875 = 52.5
\]

thus, the first term of the series is:

\[
\boxed{52.5}
\]
