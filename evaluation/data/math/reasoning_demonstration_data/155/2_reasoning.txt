Reasoning: Let's see. i have this problem here: an infinite geometric series has a common ratio of 1/8 and a sum of 60. i need to find the first term of the series. okay, infinite geometric series. i remember that for an infinite geometric series, there's a formula for the sum, right? it's something like s = a / (1 - r), where s is the sum, a is the first term, and r is the common ratio. yeah, that sounds familiar.

so, in this problem, the common ratio r is 1/8, and the sum s is 60. i need to find the first term a. so, according to the formula, s = a / (1 - r). plugging in the values i have:

60 = a / (1 - 1/8)

first, i should calculate 1 - 1/8. let's see, 1 is the same as 8/8, so 8/8 - 1/8 is 7/8. so now the equation is:

60 = a / (7/8)

hmm, dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. so, a / (7/8) is the same as a * (8/7). therefore, 60 = a * (8/7). now, i need to solve for a.

to isolate a, i can multiply both sides of the equation by 7/8. so:

a = 60 * (7/8)

let's compute that. 60 divided by 8 is 7.5, and 7.5 multiplied by 7 is... let's see, 7 times 7 is 49, and 0.5 times 7 is 3.5, so 49 + 3.5 is 52.5. therefore, a = 52.5.

wait a minute, is that correct? let me double-check. the formula s = a / (1 - r), with s = 60 and r = 1/8, so 1 - 1/8 = 7/8. then s = a / (7/8), which is a * (8/7) = 60. therefore, a = 60 * (7/8).

wait, 60 times 7 is 420, and then divided by 8 is indeed 52.5. so, yes, a = 52.5.

but i should make sure that the series converges. for an infinite geometric series to converge, the absolute value of the common ratio must be less than 1. here, r = 1/8, and |1/8| = 1/8, which is less than 1. so, the series does converge, and the sum formula applies.

is there another way to think about this? maybe by writing out the first few terms and seeing the pattern. the first term is a, the second term is a*(1/8), the third term is a*(1/8)^2, and so on. the sum s is a + a*(1/8) + a*(1/8)^2 + a*(1/8)^3 + ... and so on to infinity.

the formula s = a / (1 - r) should work here, as long as |r| < 1, which it is. so, my answer should be correct.

just to be thorough, let's plug the values back into the formula to check. if a = 52.5 and r = 1/8, then s = 52.5 / (1 - 1/8) = 52.5 / (7/8) = 52.5 * (8/7) = 60, which matches the given sum. so, it checks out.

i think that's it. the first term of the series is 52.5.

**final answer**

the first term of the series is \boxed{52.5}.
