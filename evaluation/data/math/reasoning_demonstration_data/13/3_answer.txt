Answer: **Step 1:** Understand that the perimeter of a square is the sum of all its sides, and since all sides are equal, the formula for the perimeter is:

\[
P = 4s
\]

where \( P \) is the perimeter and \( s \) is the side length.

**Step 2:** Plug in the given perimeter:

\[
4s = 32 \, \text{ft}
\]

**Step 3:** Solve for \( s \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[
s = \frac{32}{4} = 8 \, \text{ft}
\]

**Step 4:** Use the formula for the area of a square:

\[
A = s^2
\]

**Step 5:** Substitute the side length into the area formula:

\[
A = 8^2 = 64 \, \text{square feet}
\]

**Answer:** The area of the square is 64 square feet.
