Answer: To determine the smaller angle between the hour hand and the minute hand of a clock at exactly 2:30 p.m., follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the position of the hour hand:**
   - Each hour mark represents 30 degrees (since 360 degrees / 12 hours = 30 degrees per hour).
   - At 2:30, the hour hand is halfway between 2 and 3. Therefore, it has moved 15 degrees past the 2 (since 30 minutes = 1/2 hour, and 30 degrees/hour * 1/2 hour = 15 degrees).
   - The hour hand is at 2 * 30 + 15 = 75 degrees from the top.

2. **Calculate the position of the minute hand:**
   - Each minute represents 6 degrees (since 360 degrees / 60 minutes = 6 degrees per minute).
   - At 30 minutes, the minute hand is at 30 * 6 = 180 degrees from the top.

3. **Find the difference between the two positions:**
   - The difference is |180 degrees - 75 degrees| = 105 degrees.

4. **Determine the smaller angle:**
   - Since 105 degrees is less than 180 degrees, it is already the smaller angle.

Thus, the degree measure of the smaller angle between the hour hand and the minute hand at exactly 2:30 p.m. is **105 degrees**.
