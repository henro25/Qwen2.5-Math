Reasoning: So i have this problem here. there's a segment ab with endpoints a at (-1, 0) and b at (3, 8). there's a point c on this segment, and it's three times as far from a as it is from b. i need to find the coordinates of point c.

first, i need to understand what it means for c to be three times as far from a as it is from b. so, if i let the distance from c to b be x, then the distance from c to a would be 3x. that means the total length of ab is ac + cb, which is 3x + x = 4x.

wait, actually, that's not quite right. the total length of ab should be ab = ac + cb. but since c is between a and b, and ac = 3 cb, then ab = 3 cb + cb = 4 cb. so, cb = ab / 4, and ac = 3 ab / 4.

hmm, maybe i should calculate the length of ab first. let's see, the distance formula between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2). so, ab would be sqrt((3 - (-1))^2 + (8 - 0)^2) = sqrt((4)^2 + (8)^2) = sqrt(16 + 64) = sqrt(80) = 4 sqrt(5).

but i'm not sure if i need the actual length for this problem. maybe there's a better way to approach this without calculating the distance.

alternatively, i can think in terms of ratios. since c divides ab in the ratio ac:cb = 3:1, that is, c is closer to b than to a, but specifically, it's three times as far from a as from b.

i recall there's a section formula in coordinate geometry that gives the coordinates of a point dividing a segment in a given ratio.

yes, the section formula. if a point c divides the segment ab in the ratio m:n, then the coordinates of c are:

((m*x_b + n*x_a)/(m + n), (m*y_b + n*y_a)/(m + n))

in this case, the ratio is ac:cb = 3:1, so m = 3 and n = 1.

given that, plugging in the values:

x_c = (3*3 + 1*(-1))/(3 + 1) = (9 - 1)/4 = 8/4 = 2

y_c = (3*8 + 1*0)/(3 + 1) = (24 + 0)/4 = 24/4 = 6

so, the coordinates of c should be (2, 6).

wait, let me double-check that. is there another way to verify this?

maybe i can check the distances ac and cb to see if ac is indeed three times cb.

first, find the coordinates of c as (2,6). now, find ac and cb.

ac = distance between a(-1,0) and c(2,6):

sqrt((2 - (-1))^2 + (6 - 0)^2) = sqrt((3)^2 + (6)^2) = sqrt(9 + 36) = sqrt(45) = 3 sqrt(5)

cb = distance between c(2,6) and b(3,8):

sqrt((3 - 2)^2 + (8 - 6)^2) = sqrt((1)^2 + (2)^2) = sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5)

so, ac is 3 sqrt(5), and cb is sqrt(5). indeed, ac is three times cb, since 3 sqrt(5) = 3 * sqrt(5).

therefore, the coordinates of point c are (2, 6).

alternatively, i could have used vectors or parametric equations, but the section formula seems straightforward for this problem.

let me try using vectors to confirm.

let’s represent points as vectors:

a = (-1, 0), b = (3, 8), c = (x, y)

the vector ab = b - a = (3 - (-1), 8 - 0) = (4, 8)

point c divides ab in the ratio ac:cb = 3:1, which means that c is located 3/4 of the way from a to b.

so, the position vector of c is a + (3/4) * ab

compute that:

a + (3/4)*ab = (-1, 0) + (3/4)*(4, 8) = (-1, 0) + (3, 6) = (-1 + 3, 0 + 6) = (2, 6)

again, i get (2,6), which matches my previous result.

alright, seems consistent.

alternatively, i could set up parametric equations for the line ab and solve for the parameter that satisfies the given ratio.

parametric equations for ab:

x = x_a + t(x_b - x_a) = -1 + t(4) = -1 + 4t

y = y_a + t(y_b - y_a) = 0 + t(8) = 8t

where t is a parameter between 0 and 1.

point c corresponds to some t = k, where 0 < k < 1.

given that ac = 3 cb, and ab = ac + cb = 4 cb, so cb = ab / 4, ac = 3 ab / 4.

since ab corresponds to t going from 0 to 1, cb corresponds to t going from k to 1.

the length cb is proportional to (1 - k), and ac is proportional to k.

given ac = 3 cb, so k = 3(1 - k)

solving for k: k = 3 - 3k => 4k = 3 => k = 3/4

therefore, t = 3/4

plugging back into the parametric equations:

x = -1 + 4*(3/4) = -1 + 3 = 2

y = 8*(3/4) = 6

again, (2,6)

consistently arriving at the same answer reinforces that (2,6) is correct.

so, the coordinates of point c are (2,6).

**final answer**

(2, 6)
