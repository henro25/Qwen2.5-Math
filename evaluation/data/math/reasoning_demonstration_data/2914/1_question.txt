Problem: There are two colors Jessica can use to color this 2 by 2 grid. If non-overlapping regions that share a side cannot be the same color, how many possible ways are there for Jessica to color the grid?

size(101);
draw(unitsquare);
draw((0,.5)--(1,.5));
draw((.5,0)--(.5,1));
label("$A$",(0,1),NW); label("$B$",(1,1),NE); label("$C$",(1,0),SE); label("$D$",(0,0),SW);
