Problem: An ant moves on the following lattice, beginning at the dot labeled $A$. Each minute he moves to one of the dots neighboring the dot he was at, choosing from among its neighbors at random. What is the probability that after 5 minutes he is at the dot labeled $B$? [asy]
draw((-2,0)--(2,0));
draw((0,-2)--(0,2));
draw((1,1)--(1,-1)--(-1,-1)--(-1,1)--cycle);
dot((0,0)); dot((1,0)); dot((2,0)); dot((-1,0)); dot((-2,0)); dot((0,1)); dot((0,2)); dot((0,-1)); dot((0,-2)); dot((1,1)); dot((1,-1)); dot((-1,-1)); dot((-1,1));
label("$A$",(0,0),SW);
label("$B$",(0,1),NE);
