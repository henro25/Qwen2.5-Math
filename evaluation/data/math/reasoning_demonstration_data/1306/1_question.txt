Problem: Tracy had a bag of candies, and none of the candies could be broken into pieces. She ate $\frac{1}{3}$ of them and then gave $\frac{1}{4}$ of what remained to her friend Rachel. Tracy and her mom then each ate 15 candies from what Tracy had left. Finally, Tracy's brother took somewhere from one to five candies, leaving Tracy with three candies. How many candies did Tracy have at the start?
