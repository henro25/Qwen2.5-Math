Answer: The mean value of the measures of the three interior angles of any triangle is 60 degrees.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Sum of Interior Angles:** In any triangle, the sum of the three interior angles is always 180 degrees.

2. **Mean Calculation:** To find the mean (average) of the three angles, divide the sum of the angles by 3.

   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of Angles}}{3} = \frac{180^\circ}{3} = 60^\circ
   \]

3. **Conclusion:** The mean value of the measures of the three interior angles of any triangle is 60 degrees.
