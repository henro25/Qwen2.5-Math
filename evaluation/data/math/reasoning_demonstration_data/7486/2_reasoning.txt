Reasoning: So i have this problem here: i need to find the determinant of a rotation matrix r that rotates points around the origin by 58 degrees counter-clockwise. okay, let's start by recalling what a rotation matrix looks like.

i remember that in two dimensions, a rotation matrix that rotates points by an angle θ counter-clockwise is given by:

r
=
(
cos
⁡
θ
−
sin
⁡
θ
sin
⁡
θ
cos
⁡
θ
 
)
r=( 
cosθ
sinθ
​	
  
−sinθ
cosθ
​	
 )
so in this case, θ is 58 degrees. therefore, the matrix r would be:

r
=
(
cos
⁡
5
8
∘
−
sin
⁡
5
8
∘
sin
⁡
5
8
∘
cos
⁡
5
8
∘
 
)
r=( 
cos58 
∘
 
sin58 
∘
 
​	
  
−sin58 
∘
 
cos58 
∘
 
​	
 )
now, i need to find the determinant of this matrix. the determinant of a 2x2 matrix 
(
a
b
c
d
 
)
( 
a
c
​	
  
b
d
​	
 ) is calculated as 
a
d
−
b
c
ad−bc.

applying this to matrix r:

det
⁡
r
=
(
cos
⁡
5
8
∘
)
(
cos
⁡
5
8
∘
)
−
(
−
sin
⁡
5
8
∘
)
(
sin
⁡
5
8
∘
)
detr=(cos58 
∘
 )(cos58 
∘
 )−(−sin58 
∘
 )(sin58 
∘
 )
simplifying that:

det
⁡
r
=
cos
⁡
2
5
8
∘
+
sin
⁡
2
5
8
∘
detr=cos 
2
 58 
∘
 +sin 
2
 58 
∘
 
wait a minute, isn't 
cos
⁡
2
θ
+
sin
⁡
2
θ
=
1
cos 
2
 θ+sin 
2
 θ=1 for any angle θ? yeah, that's one of the fundamental trigonometric identities.

so, regardless of the value of θ, the determinant of the rotation matrix r should be 1.

but just to be thorough, let me plug in the value of θ = 58 degrees and calculate it numerically to confirm.

first, calculate 
cos
⁡
5
8
∘
cos58 
∘
  and 
sin
⁡
5
8
∘
sin58 
∘
 . i can use a calculator for this.

cos
⁡
5
8
∘
≈
0.530
cos58 
∘
 ≈0.530
sin
⁡
5
8
∘
≈
0.848
sin58 
∘
 ≈0.848
now, compute 
cos
⁡
2
5
8
∘
+
sin
⁡
2
5
8
∘
cos 
2
 58 
∘
 +sin 
2
 58 
∘
 :

(
0.530
)
2
+
(
0.848
)
2
=
0.2809
+
0.7191
=
0.9999999
(0.530) 
2
 +(0.848) 
2
 =0.2809+0.7191=0.9999999
hmm, that's very close to 1, considering the rounding errors in the decimal approximations. so, this numerical calculation supports the theoretical result that the determinant is 1.

wait, but i should consider if there's any reason the determinant could be different for this specific angle. maybe i should think about the properties of rotation matrices.

rotation matrices are orthogonal matrices, meaning that their transpose is equal to their inverse, and one of the properties of orthogonal matrices is that their determinant is either 1 or -1.

additionally, for rotation matrices in 2d, the determinant is always 1 because they preserve orientation. if the determinant were -1, it would mean the rotation includes a reflection, which it doesn't in a pure rotation.

so, in this case, since it's a pure rotation without any reflection, the determinant should definitely be 1.

another way to think about it is that the determinant of a transformation matrix gives the scaling factor of the area after the transformation. since rotation doesn't change the area of shapes, the determinant should be 1, indicating no scaling.

moreover, in general, for any rotation matrix in 2d:

r
(
θ
)
=
(
cos
⁡
θ
−
sin
⁡
θ
sin
⁡
θ
cos
⁡
θ
 
)
r(θ)=( 
cosθ
sinθ
​	
  
−sinθ
cosθ
​	
 )
the determinant is always:

det
⁡
r
(
θ
)
=
cos
⁡
2
θ
+
sin
⁡
2
θ
=
1
detr(θ)=cos 
2
 θ+sin 
2
 θ=1
this holds true for any angle θ, not just 58 degrees.

therefore, regardless of the specific angle, the determinant of a 2d rotation matrix is always 1.

i don't think there's any reason to doubt this conclusion. it seems solid both theoretically and numerically.

**final answer**
