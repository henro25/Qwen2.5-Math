Problem: A parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is reflected about the $x$-axis. The parabola and its reflection are translated horizontally five units in opposite directions to become the graphs of $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$, respectively. Which of the following describes the graph of $y=(f+g)(x)$?

(A) a parabola tangent to the $x$-axis
(B) a parabola not tangent to the $x$-axis
(C) a horizontal line
(D) a non-horizontal line
(E) the graph of a cubic function
