Reasoning: Let's see. i have this problem here: "the average of four different positive whole numbers is 4. if the difference between the largest and smallest of these numbers is as large as possible, what is the average of the other two numbers?"

first, i need to understand what's being asked. there are four different positive whole numbers, and their average is 4. that means the sum of these four numbers is 4 times 4, which is 16. so, the total sum is 16.

now, i need to make the difference between the largest and smallest number as large as possible. that means i want the largest number to be as big as possible and the smallest number to be as small as possible.

since they are positive whole numbers and different, the smallest possible number is 1. if i set the smallest number to 1, that's the smallest it can be. now, i want the largest number to be as big as possible.

but i have to remember that the sum of all four numbers is 16. so, if i set the smallest number to 1, then the remaining three numbers must sum up to 15.

to maximize the largest number, i should minimize the other two numbers. but they have to be different and larger than the smallest number, which is 1.

so, the next smallest number after 1 is 2, and the next after that is 3. so, if i set the second and third numbers to 2 and 3, then the largest number would be 16 - (1 + 2 + 3) = 16 - 6 = 10.

so, the four numbers would be 1, 2, 3, and 10. the difference between the largest and smallest is 10 - 1 = 9.

is there a way to make this difference larger? let's see.

what if i set the smallest number to 1 and try to make the largest number bigger than 10?

if i set the second number to 2 and the third to 4, then the largest number would be 16 - (1 + 2 + 4) = 16 - 7 = 9. that's smaller than 10, so that's worse.

alternatively, if i set the second number to 2 and the third to 5, then the largest number is 16 - (1 + 2 + 5) = 16 - 8 = 8. that's even smaller.

so, it seems that setting the second and third numbers to 2 and 3 gives the largest possible difference.

wait, what if i set the second number to something else?

if i set the smallest number to 1, and the second number to 3, then the third number would have to be at least 4, and the largest would be 16 - (1 + 3 + 4) = 8. again, difference is 8 - 1 = 7, which is less than 9.

what if i set the smallest number to something larger than 1? for example, set it to 2.

then, the sum of the other three numbers would be 16 - 2 = 14.

to maximize the largest number, i need to minimize the other two numbers. they have to be greater than 2 and different.

so, set them to 3 and 4. then the largest number is 16 - (2 + 3 + 4) = 16 - 9 = 7. the difference is 7 - 2 = 5, which is less than 9.

similarly, if i set the smallest number to 3, the sum of the other three is 16 - 3 = 13.

set the next numbers to 4 and 5, then the largest number is 16 - (3 + 4 + 5) = 4. difference is 4 - 3 = 1, which is much smaller.

so, it seems that setting the smallest number to 1 and the other two to 2 and 3 gives the largest possible difference of 9.

therefore, the four numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 10.

now, the problem asks for the average of the other two numbers, which are 2 and 3.

so, the average is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5.

but wait, the numbers have to be whole numbers, and the average is 2.5, which is not a whole number.

is that acceptable? the problem says "average of the other two numbers," and it doesn't specify that it has to be a whole number, just that the four numbers are whole numbers.

so, i think 2.5 is the correct answer.

let me just double-check everything to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

- four different positive whole numbers: 1, 2, 3, 10. yes, they are different and positive.

- their average is 4: (1 + 2 + 3 + 10)/4 = 16/4 = 4. correct.

- difference between largest and smallest is 10 - 1 = 9, which seems to be the largest possible difference under these constraints.

- average of the other two numbers: (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5.

everything checks out. i think that's the answer.

**final answer**

2.5
