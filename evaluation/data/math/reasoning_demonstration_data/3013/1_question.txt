Problem: A hexagon inscribed in a circle has three consecutive sides, each of length 3, and three consecutive sides, each of length 5. The chord of the circle that divides the hexagon into two trapezoids, one with three sides, each of length 3, and the other with three sides, each of length 5, has length equal to $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.
