Answer: Given that \( x \) and \( y \) are inversely proportional, we have \( x \cdot y = k \) for some constant \( k \).

when the sum of \( x \) and \( y \) is 42, and \( x \) is twice \( y \), we have:
\[
x + y = 42 \quad \text{and} \quad x = 2y
\]
substituting \( x = 2y \) into the sum equation:
\[
2y + y = 42 \implies 3y = 42 \implies y = 14
\]
then, \( x = 2y = 2 \cdot 14 = 28 \).

to find the constant \( k \):
\[
k = x \cdot y = 28 \cdot 14 = 392
\]

now, when \( x = -8 \), we use the inverse proportionality:
\[
x \cdot y = k \implies -8 \cdot y = 392 \implies y = \frac{392}{-8} = -49
\]

thus, the value of \( y \) when \( x = -8 \) is:
\[
\boxed{-49}
\]
