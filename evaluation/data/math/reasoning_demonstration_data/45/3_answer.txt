Answer: **Given:**
- A rectangle has an area of 400 cm².
- The rectangle is a square.

**Find:**
- The perimeter of the square.

**Step 1: Understand the relationship between area and side length of a square.**
- For a square, all sides are equal.
- Let the side length be \( s \).
- The area \( A \) of a square is \( A = s^2 \).

**Step 2: Set up the equation for area.**
- Given that the area is 400 cm²:
  \[
  s^2 = 400
  \]

**Step 3: Solve for \( s \).**
- Take the square root of both sides:
  \[
  s = \sqrt{400} = 20 \text{ cm}
  \]

**Step 4: Calculate the perimeter of the square.**
- The perimeter \( P \) of a square is \( P = 4s \).
- Substituting \( s = 20 \) cm:
  \[
  P = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ cm}
  \]

**Answer:**
The perimeter of the square is 80 cm.
