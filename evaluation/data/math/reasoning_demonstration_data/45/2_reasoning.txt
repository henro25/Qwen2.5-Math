Reasoning: Alright, so I've got this problem here. It says that a rectangle has an area of 400 square centimeters, and if the rectangle is a square, what is its perimeter? Okay, let's see. I know that a square is a special kind of rectangle where all sides are equal. So, if it's a square, then the length and the width are the same.

The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. Since it's a square, that means length times width is the same as side squared. So, if I let the side of the square be 's', then the area is s times s, which is s squared.

Given that the area is 400 square centimeters, I can set up the equation s squared equals 400. To find 's', I need to take the square root of both sides. The square root of 400 is 20, so each side of the square is 20 centimeters.

Now, to find the perimeter of the square, I know that the perimeter is the sum of all sides. Since all sides are equal, that's just 4 times the length of one side. So, 4 times 20 centimeters should give me the perimeter.

Wait a minute, let me double-check that. If the area is 400, and the side is 20, then 20 times 20 is indeed 400. And the perimeter being 4 times 20 is 80 centimeters. That seems right. I don't think I've missed anything here. The problem seems straightforward since it's a square.
