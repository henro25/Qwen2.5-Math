Answer: 1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let Joe's age be \( J \).
   - Billy's age is twice Joe's age, so Billy's age is \( 2J \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The sum of their ages is 45:
     \[
     J + 2J = 45
     \]

3. **Solve for \( J \):**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     3J = 45
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 3:
     \[
     J = 15
     \]

4. **Find Billy's Age:**
   - Since Billy is twice Joe's age:
     \[
     2J = 2 \times 15 = 30
     \]

**Answer:** Billy is 30 years old.
