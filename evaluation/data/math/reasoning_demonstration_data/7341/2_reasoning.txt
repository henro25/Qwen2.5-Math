Reasoning: Alright, so I've got this math problem here. It says, "Billy's age is twice Joe's age and the sum of their ages is 45. How old is Billy?" Okay, let's see. I need to find out how old Billy is.

First, I should probably define some variables to represent their ages. Let's say Joe's age is J, and since Billy is twice as old as Joe, Billy's age would be 2 times J, so 2J. That makes sense so far.

Now, the sum of their ages is 45. So, if I add Joe's age and Billy's age together, it should equal 45. That means J plus 2J equals 45. So, J + 2J = 45.

Combining like terms, J + 2J is 3J, so 3J = 45. To find J, I need to divide both sides by 3. So, J = 45 divided by 3, which is 15. Okay, so Joe is 15 years old.

But the question is asking for Billy's age, not Joe's. Since Billy is twice Joe's age, and Joe is 15, Billy should be 2 times 15, which is 30. So, Billy is 30 years old.

Wait a minute, let me double-check that. If Billy is 30 and Joe is 15, their ages add up to 45, which matches the problem statement. And 30 is indeed twice 15. Seems correct.

I guess that's the answer. Billy is 30 years old.
