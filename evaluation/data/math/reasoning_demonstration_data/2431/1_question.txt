Problem: A right cylindrical oil tank is $15$ feet tall and its circular bases have diameters of $4$ feet each. When the tank is lying flat on its side (not on one of the circular ends), the oil inside is $3$ feet deep. How deep, in feet, would the oil have been if the tank had been standing upright on one of its bases? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.
