Reasoning: Alright, so I've got this problem here about seating eight All-Stars at a press conference. There are three Cubs, three Red Sox, and two Yankees, and the teammates want to sit together. I need to figure out how many ways they can be seated in a row under these conditions.

Okay, first things first, I need to understand the constraints. The teammates want to sit together, which means all the Cubs should be seated next to each other, all the Red Sox together, and all the Yankees together. So, it's like treating each team as a single unit initially.

So, if I think of each team as one big block, I have three blocks: Cubs, Red Sox, and Yankees. Now, how many ways can I arrange these three blocks in a row? Well, that's just the number of permutations of three items, which is 3 factorial, or 3!.

3! is 3 × 2 × 1, which is 6. So, there are six ways to arrange the three team blocks.

But wait, within each team block, the individual players can be arranged among themselves. So, for the Cubs, there are three players, and they can be arranged in 3! ways. Similarly, the Red Sox have three players, so another 3! arrangements, and the Yankees have two players, so 2! arrangements.

So, for each of the team blocks, I need to multiply the number of ways to arrange the players within the block by the number of ways to arrange the blocks themselves.

That means the total number of arrangements is the number of ways to arrange the blocks (3!) multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the players within each block (3! for Cubs, 3! for Red Sox, and 2! for Yankees).

So, total arrangements = 3! × 3! × 3! × 2!

Calculating that out: 3! is 6, so 6 × 6 × 6 × 2.

First, 6 × 6 is 36, then 36 × 6 is 216, and 216 × 2 is 432.

So, there should be 432 ways to arrange the eight All-Stars with teammates sitting together.

But, let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything. Are there any other constraints or considerations?

The problem says teammates insist on sitting together, and I've treated each team as a single block that can be arranged in any order, and within each block, the players can be arranged in any order.

I think that covers all possibilities. There are no restrictions on which team sits where, other than the fact that teammates must be together.

So, yeah, 432 seems correct.
