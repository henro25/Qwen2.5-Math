Answer: To solve the problem of seating the eight All-Stars, with teammates sitting together, we follow these steps:

1. **Treat each team as a single block:**
   - There are three teams: Cubs (3 members), Red Sox (3 members), and Yankees (2 members).
   - These three blocks can be arranged in \( 3! \) ways.

2. **Arrange players within each block:**
   - The 3 Cubs can be arranged among themselves in \( 3! \) ways.
   - The 3 Red Sox can be arranged among themselves in \( 3! \) ways.
   - The 2 Yankees can be arranged among themselves in \( 2! \) ways.

3. **Calculate the total number of arrangements:**
   \[
   \text{Total arrangements} = 3! \times 3! \times 3! \times 2!
   \]
   \[
   = 6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 2 = 432
   \]

**Answer:** There are 432 ways to seat the eight All-Stars with teammates sitting together.
