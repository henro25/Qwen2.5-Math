Problem: Let $a_0$, $a_1$, $a_2$, $\dots$ be an infinite sequence of real numbers such that $a_0 = \frac{5}{13}$ and
\[
  a_{n} = 2 a_{n-1}^2 - 1
\]for every positive integer $n$.  Let $c$ be the smallest number such that for every positive integer $n$, the product of the first $n$ terms satisfies the inequality
\[|a_0 a_1 \dotsm a_{n - 1}| \le \frac{c}{2^n}.\]What is the value of $100c$, rounded to the nearest integer?
