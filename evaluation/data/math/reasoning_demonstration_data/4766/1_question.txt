Problem: The function $f$ has the property that for each real number $x$ in its domain, $1/x$ is also in its domain and \[
f(x) + f\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = x.
\]What is the largest set of real numbers that can be in the domain of $f$?

(a) ${\{x\mid x\ne0\}}$

(b) ${\{x\mid x<0\}}$

(c) ${\{x\mid x>0\}}$

(d) ${\{x\mid x\ne-1\ \text{and}\ x\ne0\ \text{and}\ x\ne1\}}$

(e) ${\{-1,1\}}$
