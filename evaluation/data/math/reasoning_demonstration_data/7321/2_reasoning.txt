Reasoning: So i have this trigonometry problem here: if sec x plus tan x equals 5 over 2, then i need to find sec x minus tan x. hmm, let's see how to approach this.

first, i recall that sec x is 1 over cos x, and tan x is sin x over cos x. so, sec x plus tan x is 1/cos x plus sin x/cos x, which simplifies to (1 + sin x)/cos x. but i'm not sure if that's helpful right now.

wait, maybe there's a better way. i remember that there are some identities involving sec x and tan x. specifically, i think that sec^2 x minus tan^2 x equals 1. yeah, that's right! so, sec^2 x minus tan^2 x = 1.

now, if i have sec x plus tan x and sec x minus tan x, maybe i can use these to find one in terms of the other. let's see, if i multiply (sec x + tan x) by (sec x - tan x), what do i get? using the difference of squares formula, that should be sec^2 x minus tan^2 x, which is 1, according to the identity i just recalled.

so, (sec x + tan x)(sec x - tan x) = 1.

i know that sec x + tan x is 5/2, so plugging that in:

(5/2)(sec x - tan x) = 1.

now, i can solve for sec x - tan x by dividing both sides by 5/2, which is the same as multiplying by 2/5:

sec x - tan x = 1 * (2/5) = 2/5.

wait a minute, that seems straightforward. is there anything i'm missing here? maybe i should check if this makes sense.

let me verify by finding sec x and tan x individually. if sec x + tan x = 5/2 and sec x - tan x = 2/5, then i can solve for sec x and tan x by adding and subtracting these equations.

adding them: (sec x + tan x) + (sec x - tan x) = 5/2 + 2/5.

that gives 2 sec x = (25/10 + 4/10) = 29/10.

so, sec x = 29/20.

subtracting them: (sec x + tan x) - (sec x - tan x) = 5/2 - 2/5.

that gives 2 tan x = (25/10 - 4/10) = 21/10.

so, tan x = 21/20.

now, let's check if sec^2 x - tan^2 x equals 1.

sec^2 x = (29/20)^2 = 841/400.

tan^2 x = (21/20)^2 = 441/400.

subtracting them: 841/400 - 441/400 = 400/400 = 1.

yes, that checks out. so, my answer for sec x - tan x being 2/5 seems correct.

i think that's it. it wasn't too bad after all. just using the identity and solving the equations.
