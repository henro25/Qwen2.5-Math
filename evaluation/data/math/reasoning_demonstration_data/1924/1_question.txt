Problem: A certain coin is weighted such that the chance of flipping heads is $\frac{1}{3}$ and the chance of flipping tails is $\frac{2}{3}$.  Suppose that we win $\$3$ if we flip a heads on a coin toss, but lose $\$2$ if we flip tails.  What is the expected value, in dollars, of our winnings after one flip?  Express your answer as a common fraction.
