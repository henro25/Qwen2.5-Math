Answer: To determine which functions are invertible, we need to check if each function is one-to-one (injective) over its domain.

1. **function (2):** given by \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x \). this is a quadratic function, which is not one-to-one over its entire domain because it fails the horizontal line test. therefore, it is not invertible.

2. **function (3):** given by discrete points with domain \(\{-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2\}\) and points \((-5, 3), (-4, 5), (-3, 1), (-2, 0), (-1, 2), (0, -4), (1, -3), (2, -2)\). each y-value is unique, so this function is one-to-one and thus invertible.

3. **function (4):** given by \( h(x) = -\arctan(x) \). the arctangent function is strictly increasing, and multiplying by -1 makes it strictly decreasing. therefore, it is one-to-one and invertible.

4. **function (5):** given by \( k(x) = \frac{4}{x} \). this function is strictly decreasing for \( x > 0 \) and \( x < 0 \), and it is one-to-one over its domain (all real numbers except \( x = 0 \)). therefore, it is invertible.

the invertible functions are labeled (3), (4), and (5). the product of their labels is:
\[
3 \times 4 \times 5 = 60
\]

thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]
