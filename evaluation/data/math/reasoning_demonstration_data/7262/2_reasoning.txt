Reasoning: So i've got this problem here: "a fair 6-sided die is rolled once. if i roll n, then i win $6 - n$ dollars. what is the expected value of my win, in dollars?" okay, let's try to break this down step by step.

first, i need to understand what expected value means. from what i remember, the expected value is like the average outcome you'd expect if you did the experiment many times. so, in this case, if i rolled the die a bunch of times and calculated my winnings each time, the expected value would be the average of all those winnings.

the die is fair, which means each face (1 through 6) has an equal probability of landing face up. so, the probability of rolling any particular number n is 1/6.

now, the problem says that if i roll n, i win $6 - n$ dollars. so, for each possible outcome of the die roll, i can calculate the corresponding win.

let me list out the possible outcomes and their associated winnings:

- if i roll a 1, i win $6 - 1 = $5

- if i roll a 2, i win $6 - 2 = $4

- if i roll a 3, i win $6 - 3 = $3

- if i roll a 4, i win $6 - 4 = $2

- if i roll a 5, i win $6 - 5 = $1

- if i roll a 6, i win $6 - 6 = $0

so, my possible winnings are $5, $4, $3, $2, $1, and $0, corresponding to rolling a 1 through 6, respectively.

to find the expected value, i need to multiply each possible win by its probability and then add all those up. since the die is fair, each outcome has a probability of 1/6.

so, the expected value e is:

e = (probability of rolling 1) * (win when rolling 1) + (probability of rolling 2) * (win when rolling 2) + ... + (probability of rolling 6) * (win when rolling 6)

plugging in the numbers:

e = (1/6)*5 + (1/6)*4 + (1/6)*3 + (1/6)*2 + (1/6)*1 + (1/6)*0

now, i can factor out the 1/6 since it's common to all terms:

e = (1/6)*(5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0)

let me calculate the sum inside the parentheses:

5 + 4 = 9

9 + 3 = 12

12 + 2 = 14

14 + 1 = 15

15 + 0 = 15

so, e = (1/6)*15

now, 15 divided by 6 is 2.5.

so, the expected value is $2.50.

wait a minute, does this make sense? let me double-check.

alternatively, i know that the expected value of a discrete random variable is the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability.

in this case, the outcomes are the winnings: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, each with probability 1/6.

adding them up: 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 15

divide by 6: 15/6 = 2.5

yes, that seems consistent.

is there another way to think about this problem that might confirm my answer?

well, the die is fair, so the average roll is (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6 = 21/6 = 3.5

but in this problem, the win is $6 - n$, where n is the roll.

so, the average win should be $6 - (average roll)

since the average roll is 3.5, then the average win is 6 - 3.5 = 2.5

yes, that matches my previous calculation.

alternatively, i could think about the linearity of expectation. the expected value of 6 - n is 6 - e(n), where e(n) is the expected value of n.

since e(n) is 3.5, then e(6 - n) = 6 - 3.5 = 2.5

again, the same answer.

okay, i feel confident that the expected value of my win is $2.50.

**final answer**

2.5
