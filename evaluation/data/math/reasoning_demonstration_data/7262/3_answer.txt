Answer: To find the expected value of the win when rolling a fair 6-sided die, where the win is $6 - n$ dollars if the die shows $n$, we follow these steps:

1. list the possible outcomes and their corresponding wins:
   - roll 1: win $5
   - roll 2: win $4
   - roll 3: win $3
   - roll 4: win $2
   - roll 5: win $1
   - roll 6: win $0

2. calculate the expected value by summing the products of each win and its probability:
   \[
   e = \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) \times 5 + \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) \times 4 + \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) \times 3 + \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) \times 2 + \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) \times 1 + \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) \times 0
   \]

3. factor out the common probability \(\frac{1}{6}\):
   \[
   e = \frac{1}{6} \times (5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0)
   \]

4. calculate the sum inside the parentheses:
   \[
   5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 15
   \]

5. divide by 6 to find the expected value:
   \[
   e = \frac{15}{6} = 2.5
   \]

thus, the expected value of the win is \(\boxed{2.5}\) dollars.
