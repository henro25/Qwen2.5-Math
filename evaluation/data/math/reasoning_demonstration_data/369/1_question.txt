Problem: For some integers that are not palindromes, like 91, a person can create a palindrome by repeatedly reversing the number and adding the original number to its reverse. For example, $91 + 19 = 110$. Then $110+011 = 121$, which is a palindrome, so 91 takes two steps to become a palindrome. Of all positive integers between 10 and 100, what is the sum of the non-palindrome integers that take exactly six steps to become palindromes?
