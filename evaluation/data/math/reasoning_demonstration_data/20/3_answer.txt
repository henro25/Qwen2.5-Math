Answer: Given that \( o \) is the circumcenter and \( h \) is the orthocenter of triangle \( abc \), with the circumradius \( r = 7 \) and the sum of the squares of the side lengths \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 29 \), we need to find \( oh^2 \).

using euler's formula, which states that \( oh^2 = 9r^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \), we can substitute the given values:

\[
oh^2 = 9r^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)
\]

substituting \( r = 7 \) and \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 29 \):

\[
oh^2 = 9 \times 7^2 - 29
\]

\[
oh^2 = 9 \times 49 - 29
\]

\[
oh^2 = 441 - 29
\]

\[
oh^2 = 412
\]

thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{412}
\]
