Reasoning: Alright, so I've got this problem here. It says that one US dollar is equal to 7 Namibian dollars and also equal to 6 Chinese yuan. There's a painting that costs 105 Namibian dollars, and I need to figure out how much that would be in Chinese yuan.

Okay, first things first, I need to understand the relationships between these currencies. US dollars are connected to both Namibian dollars and Chinese yuan, so maybe I can use that to convert between Namibian dollars and Chinese yuan.

Let me think. If 1 US dollar is 7 Namibian dollars, that means that to get the value in US dollars, I can divide the Namibian dollars by 7. So, if something costs 105 Namibian dollars, in US dollars, that would be 105 divided by 7, which is... 15 US dollars.

Now, I need to convert that 15 US dollars into Chinese yuan. The problem says that 1 US dollar is equal to 6 Chinese yuan. So, if I have 15 US dollars, I just multiply that by 6 to get the amount in yuan. 15 times 6 is... 90. So, the painting should cost 90 Chinese yuan.

Wait a minute, is there another way to approach this? Maybe I can find a direct conversion rate between Namibian dollars and Chinese yuan without going through US dollars. Let's see.

I know that 1 US dollar is 7 Namibian dollars and also 6 Chinese yuan. So, if I set up a ratio, I can say that 7 Namibian dollars are equal to 6 Chinese yuan. That means that for every 7 Namibian dollars, there are 6 Chinese yuan.

So, if the painting costs 105 Namibian dollars, I can divide that by 7 to see how many sets of 7 Namibian dollars there are, and then multiply by 6 to get the equivalent in Chinese yuan. 105 divided by 7 is 15, and 15 times 6 is again 90. Okay, that matches what I got before.

I think both methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring. So, the painting costs 90 Chinese yuan.
