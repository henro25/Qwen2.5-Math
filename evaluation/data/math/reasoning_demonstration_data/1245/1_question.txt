Problem: Matt will arrange four identical, dotless dominoes (shaded 1 by 2 rectangles) on the 5 by 4 grid below so that a path is formed from the upper left-hand corner $A$ to the lower righthand corner $B$. In a path, consecutive dominoes must touch at their sides and not just their corners. No domino may be placed diagonally; each domino covers exactly two of the unit squares shown on the grid. One arrangement is shown. How many distinct arrangements are possible, including the one shown?
