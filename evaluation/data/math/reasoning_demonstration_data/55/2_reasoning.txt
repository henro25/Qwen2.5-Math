Reasoning: Okay, so I've got this problem here. It says I have four digits: 2, 4, 6, and 7. I need to form different positive two-digit integers using these digits, and I can't repeat any digit in an integer. Alright, let's see.

First, I need to understand what a two-digit integer is. It's a number that has a tens place and a units place. So, for example, in the number 24, 2 is in the tens place and 4 is in the units place.

Now, I have to use the digits 2, 4, 6, and 7, and I can't repeat any digit in a single number. That means if I use 2 in the tens place, I can't use it again in the units place for that number.

I think the best way to approach this is to list out all possible combinations. Let's start by choosing a digit for the tens place. I have four options: 2, 4, 6, or 7.

If I choose 2 for the tens place, then for the units place, I can't use 2 again. So, I have to choose from 4, 6, or 7. That gives me three possibilities: 24, 26, and 27.

Next, if I choose 4 for the tens place, I can't use 4 again. So, for the units place, I can use 2, 6, or 7. That gives me three more numbers: 42, 46, and 47.

Then, if I choose 6 for the tens place, I can't use 6 again. So, the units place can be 2, 4, or 7. That gives me another three numbers: 62, 64, and 67.

Finally, if I choose 7 for the tens place, I can't use 7 again. So, the units place can be 2, 4, or 6. That gives me three more numbers: 72, 74, and 76.

So, adding those up: 3 (from 2 as tens) + 3 (from 4 as tens) + 3 (from 6 as tens) + 3 (from 7 as tens) = 12 different numbers in total.

Wait a minute, is there a faster way to calculate this without listing them all out? I remember something about permutations. Permutations are arrangements of items where the order matters, and in this case, the order definitely matters because 24 is different from 42.

So, for permutations of n items taken r at a time, the formula is n! / (n - r)!, where "!" denotes factorial.

Here, n is 4 (since there are four digits: 2, 4, 6, 7) and r is 2 (since we're forming two-digit numbers).

So, the number of permutations should be 4! / (4 - 2)! = 4! / 2! = (4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / (2 × 1) = 24 / 2 = 12.

Okay, that matches what I got when I listed them all out. So, there are 12 different positive two-digit integers that can be formed using these digits without repeating any digit in an integer.

I think that's the answer. Let me just double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything. The digits are distinct, and I've accounted for all possible combinations without repetition. Yeah, I'm pretty confident about this.
