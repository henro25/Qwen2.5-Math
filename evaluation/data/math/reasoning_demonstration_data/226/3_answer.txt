Answer: To determine the number of nonnegative solutions to the equation \( x^2 = -4x \), we start by rearranging the equation:

\[
x^2 + 4x = 0
\]

next, we factor the equation:

\[
x(x + 4) = 0
\]

using the zero product property, we set each factor equal to zero:

1. \( x = 0 \)
2. \( x + 4 = 0 \) which implies \( x = -4 \)

since we are looking for nonnegative solutions, we discard \( x = -4 \) because it is negative. thus, the only nonnegative solution is \( x = 0 \).

to verify, we substitute \( x = 0 \) back into the original equation:

\[
(0)^2 = -4(0) \implies 0 = 0
\]

this confirms that \( x = 0 \) is a valid solution. 

therefore, the number of nonnegative solutions is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]
