Reasoning: So i have this equation here: 
x
2
=
−
4
x
x 
2
 =−4x. i need to find out how many nonnegative solutions there are to this equation. okay, let's start by understanding what this equation is saying.

first off, nonnegative solutions mean that 
x
x has to be greater than or equal to zero. so, 
x
≥
0
x≥0. got it.

now, looking at the equation 
x
2
=
−
4
x
x 
2
 =−4x, i see that it's a quadratic equation. quadratic equations usually have up to two real solutions, but in this case, since we're restricting ourselves to nonnegative solutions, there might be fewer.

let me try to solve this equation step by step. maybe i can rearrange it to make it easier to solve.

so, 
x
2
=
−
4
x
x 
2
 =−4x.

if i move all terms to one side, i get:

x
2
+
4
x
=
0
x 
2
 +4x=0

hmm, that looks better. now, i can factor this equation. factoring is a common method to solve quadratic equations.

let's see, both terms have an 
x
x in common, so i can factor that out:

x
(
x
+
4
)
=
0
x(x+4)=0

okay, so now i have a product of two factors equal to zero. according to the zero product property, if a product of two factors is zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero.

so, set each factor equal to zero:

1. 
x
=
0
x=0

2. 
x
+
4
=
0
x+4=0 which implies 
x
=
−
4
x=−4

alright, so the solutions are 
x
=
0
x=0 and 
x
=
−
4
x=−4.

but wait, the problem asks for nonnegative solutions. that means 
x
x has to be greater than or equal to zero. so, 
x
=
−
4
x=−4 is negative and doesn't satisfy the nonnegative condition.

therefore, the only nonnegative solution is 
x
=
0
x=0.

let me double-check to make sure i didn't miss anything.

i can plug 
x
=
0
x=0 back into the original equation to verify:

(
0
)
2
=
−
4
(
0
)
(0) 
2
 =−4(0)

which simplifies to:

0
=
0
0=0

that checks out.

now, just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other possible solutions that i might have missed.

one thing i can think of is whether there are any extraneous solutions introduced during the solving process. but in this case, since i factored the equation properly and applied the zero product property correctly, i don't think that's an issue.

another thing is to consider if the equation could be solved in a different way, just to confirm the solution.

let me try solving the original equation differently.

starting again with 
x
2
=
−
4
x
x 
2
 =−4x, maybe i can divide both sides by 
x
x, but wait, i have to be careful here. if 
x
=
0
x=0, then dividing by 
x
x would be dividing by zero, which is undefined. so, i need to consider the case where 
x
=
0
x=0 separately.

so, first, consider 
x
=
0
x=0. as i already did, plugging in gives a valid solution.

now, assuming 
x
≠
0
x

=0, i can divide both sides by 
x
x:

x
2
x
=
−
4
x
x
x
x 
2
 
​
 = 
x
−4x
​
 

simplifying, that gives:

x
=
−
4
x=−4

but again, 
x
=
−
4
x=−4 is negative, which doesn't satisfy the nonnegative condition.

therefore, the only nonnegative solution is 
x
=
0
x=0.

alternatively, i could graph the functions 
y
=
x
2
y=x 
2
  and 
y
=
−
4
x
y=−4x and look for their points of intersection where 
x
≥
0
x≥0.

graphing 
y
=
x
2
y=x 
2
 , it's a parabola opening upwards with vertex at the origin.

graphing 
y
=
−
4
x
y=−4x, it's a straight line with a negative slope passing through the origin.

the point of intersection at 
x
=
0
x=0 is clear. for 
x
>
0
x>0, 
y
=
x
2
y=x 
2
  is positive, while 
y
=
−
4
x
y=−4x is negative, so they don't intersect again in the nonnegative region.

therefore, confirming that the only nonnegative solution is 
x
=
0
x=0.

just to cover all bases, i can also consider solving the equation using the quadratic formula.

the general form of a quadratic equation is 
a
x
2
+
b
x
+
c
=
0
ax 
2
 +bx+c=0.

comparing to my equation 
x
2
+
4
x
=
0
x 
2
 +4x=0, i have 
a
=
1
a=1, 
b
=
4
b=4, and 
c
=
0
c=0.

the quadratic formula is:

x
=
−
b
±
b
2
−
4
a
c
2
a
x= 
2a
−b± 
b 
2
 −4ac
​
 
​
 

plugging in the values:

x
=
−
4
±
16
−
0
2
x= 
2
−4± 
16−0
​
 
​
 

simplifying:

x
=
−
4
±
4
2
x= 
2
−4±4
​
 

so, two solutions:

1. 
x
=
−
4
+
4
2
=
0
2
=
0
x= 
2
−4+4
​
 = 
2
0
​
 =0

2. 
x
=
−
4
−
4
2
=
−
8
2
=
−
4
x= 
2
−4−4
​
 = 
2
−8
​
 =−4

again, 
x
=
−
4
x=−4 is negative, so only 
x
=
0
x=0 is nonnegative.

i think i've covered all possible methods to solve this equation and confirmed that the only nonnegative solution is 
x
=
0
x=0.

so, the number of nonnegative solutions is one.
