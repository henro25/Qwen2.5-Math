Reasoning: Alright, so I've got this math problem here: "What is the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime?" Okay, let's break this down. I need to find the product, which means I need to multiply some numbers together. Specifically, it's the product of two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime.

First, I need to figure out what the one-digit primes are. Primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, one-digit primes would be primes from 1 to 9. Let me list them out: 2, 3, 5, and 7. Wait, is 1 considered a prime? No, I think 1 is not a prime number. Yeah, primes start from 2.

So, the one-digit primes are 2, 3, 5, and 7. The two largest among them are 7 and 5. So, those are the two largest one-digit primes.

Next, I need the largest two-digit prime. Two-digit numbers range from 10 to 99. I need to find the largest prime in that range. Let's think about this. 99 is not a prime because it's divisible by 9 and 11, I think. Wait, actually, 99 is 9 times 11, so that's not prime. What about 97? Is 97 a prime number? Let me check. 97 is only divisible by 1 and itself, so yes, 97 is a prime number. Is there any prime larger than 97 that's still a two-digit number? Well, 98 is even, so divisible by 2. 99, as we said, is not prime. 100 is not a two-digit number. So, 97 must be the largest two-digit prime.

Okay, so now I have the two largest one-digit primes: 7 and 5, and the largest two-digit prime: 97. The problem is asking for the product of these three numbers. So, I need to multiply them together: 7 times 5 times 97.

Let me calculate that step by step. First, 7 times 5 is 35. Then, 35 times 97. Hmm, how do I multiply 35 by 97? Maybe I can break it down. 35 times 100 would be 3500, but since it's 97, which is 100 minus 3, I can subtract 3 times 35 from 3500. So, 3 times 35 is 105. Therefore, 3500 minus 105 is 3395.

Wait, is there another way to check this multiplication? Maybe I can do it directly. 35 times 97. 35 times 90 is 3150, and 35 times 7 is 245. Adding those together, 3150 plus 245 is indeed 3395.

So, the product of 7, 5, and 97 is 3395. That should be the answer.

But let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The one-digit primes are 2, 3, 5, and 7, with the two largest being 7 and 5. The largest two-digit prime is 97. Multiplying them: 7 times 5 is 35, and 35 times 97 is 3395. Yeah, that seems correct.

I don't think I missed anything here. The problem was straightforward once I identified the primes involved. I should be confident with this answer.
