Answer: To determine the month with the fewest relatively prime dates, we need to analyze each month and find how many days are relatively prime to the month number, meaning the greatest common factor (GCF) of the month and day is 1.

We proceed by examining each month:

- **January (1)**: All 31 days are relatively prime to 1.
- **February (2)**: Odd days (1, 3, 5, ..., 27) are relatively prime, giving 14 dates.
- **March (3)**: Days not divisible by 3 yield 21 relatively prime dates.
- **April (4)**: Odd days (1, 3, 5, ..., 29) give 15 relatively prime dates.
- **May (5)**: Days not divisible by 5 yield 25 relatively prime dates.
- **June (6)**: Days not divisible by 2 or 3 give 10 relatively prime dates.
- **July (7)**: Days not divisible by 7 yield 27 relatively prime dates.
- **August (8)**: Odd days (1, 3, 5, ..., 31) give 16 relatively prime dates.
- **September (9)**: Days not divisible by 3 yield 20 relatively prime dates.
- **October (10)**: Days not divisible by 2 or 5 give 13 relatively prime dates.
- **November (11)**: Days not divisible by 11 yield 28 relatively prime dates.
- **December (12)**: Days not divisible by 2 or 3 give 11 relatively prime dates.

The month with the fewest relatively prime dates is **June**, with **10** relatively prime dates.

Thus, the answer is:

**10**.
