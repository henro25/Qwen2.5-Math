Reasoning: Okay, so I've got this problem about relatively prime dates. It says that a relatively prime date is one where the month and the day have no common factors other than 1. For example, June is the 6th month, and if the day is the 17th, since 6 and 17 don't share any factors besides 1, that's a relatively prime date.

The question is asking how many relatively prime dates are in the month that has the fewest of these dates. So, I need to figure out which month has the least number of days that are relatively prime to its month number, and then find out how many there are in that month.

First, I need to understand what it means for two numbers to be relatively prime. That means their greatest common factor (GCF) is 1. So, if I take the month number and the day number, and their GCF is 1, it's a relatively prime date.

There are 12 months in a year, from 1 to 12. Each month has a different number of days: January has 31, February has 28 or 29, March has 31, and so on. I think for simplicity, I'll assume it's not a leap year, so February has 28 days.

I need to go through each month, determine how many days in that month are relatively prime to the month number, and then find out which month has the fewest of these dates.

Maybe I can make a table or list to keep track.

Let's start with January, which is month 1. Since 1 is relatively prime to every number, all 31 days in January are relatively prime to 1. So, January has 31 relatively prime dates.

February is month 2. I need to find how many days from 1 to 28 are relatively prime to 2. That means days that are odd numbers because even numbers share a factor of 2 with the month number. So, days 1,3,5,...,27,28? Wait, 28 is even, so not relatively prime to 2. So, days 1,3,5,...,27. That's 14 days.

March is month 3. I need days that are not multiples of 3. Days from 1 to 31, excluding multiples of 3. Let's see, multiples of 3 up to 31 are 3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30. That's 10 days that are not relatively prime, so 31 - 10 = 21 relatively prime dates.

April is month 4. Days from 1 to 30. I need days that don't share a factor with 4, which is 2^2. So, days that are odd numbers, since even days share a factor of 2. So, days 1,3,5,...,29. There are 15 days.

May is month 5. Days from 1 to 31. Since 5 and any day not a multiple of 5 are relatively prime. Multiples of 5 up to 31 are 5,10,15,20,25,30. So, 6 days not relatively prime, so 31 - 6 = 25 relatively prime dates.

June is month 6. Days from 1 to 30. 6 factors into 2 and 3. So, days that are not multiples of 2 or 3 are relatively prime to 6. Let's find the days that are multiples of 2 or 3. Multiples of 2: 2,4,6,...,30 (15 days). Multiples of 3: 3,6,9,...,30 (10 days). But some days are multiples of both 2 and 3, like multiples of 6: 6,12,18,24,30 (5 days). So, total days not relatively prime are 15 + 10 - 5 = 20 days. So, 30 - 20 = 10 relatively prime dates.

July is month 7. Days from 1 to 31. 7 and any day not a multiple of 7 are relatively prime. Multiples of 7 up to 31 are 7,14,21,28. So, 4 days not relatively prime, so 31 - 4 = 27 relatively prime dates.

August is month 8. Days from 1 to 31. 8 factors into 2^3. So, days that are odd numbers are relatively prime to 8. Days 1,3,5,...,31. That's 16 days.

September is month 9. Days from 1 to 30. 9 factors into 3^2. So, days not multiples of 3 are relatively prime to 9. Multiples of 3 up to 30 are 3,6,9,...,30 (10 days). So, 30 - 10 = 20 relatively prime dates.

October is month 10. Days from 1 to 31. 10 factors into 2 and 5. So, days not multiples of 2 or 5 are relatively prime to 10. Let's find multiples of 2: 2,4,6,...,30 (15 days). Multiples of 5: 5,10,15,20,25,30 (6 days). Multiples of both 2 and 5 are multiples of 10: 10,20,30 (3 days). So, total days not relatively prime are 15 + 6 - 3 = 18 days. So, 31 - 18 = 13 relatively prime dates.

November is month 11. Days from 1 to 30. 11 and any day not a multiple of 11 are relatively prime. Multiples of 11 up to 30 are 11,22. So, 2 days not relatively prime, so 30 - 2 = 28 relatively prime dates.

December is month 12. Days from 1 to 31. 12 factors into 2^2 * 3. So, days not multiples of 2 or 3 are relatively prime to 12. Multiples of 2: 2,4,6,...,30 (15 days). Multiples of 3: 3,6,9,...,30 (10 days). Multiples of both 2 and 3 are multiples of 6: 6,12,18,24,30 (5 days). So, total days not relatively prime are 15 + 10 - 5 = 20 days. So, 31 - 20 = 11 relatively prime dates.

Now, looking back at all the months:

- January: 31

- February: 14

- March: 21

- April: 15

- May: 25

- June: 10

- July: 27

- August: 16

- September: 20

- October: 13

- November: 28

- December: 11

So, the month with the fewest relatively prime dates is June with 10, followed by October with 13 and December with 11.

Wait, no, December has 11, which is more than June's 10. October has 13, which is also more than June's 10.

So, June has the fewest with 10 relatively prime dates.

Therefore, the answer should be 10.
