Reasoning: Let's see. i've got this problem here with three different expressions, a, b, and c, and i need to figure out which one is the largest. the expressions are:

a: (2006/2005) + (2006/2007)

b: (2006/2007) + (2008/2007)

c: (2007/2006) + (2007/2008)

hmm, all these fractions are pretty close to 1, but not exactly 1. maybe i can compare them by simplifying or finding a common ground.

first, i notice that all denominators are around 2005 to 2008, and numerators are similar. maybe i can look at each pair separately and see how they compare.

starting with expression a: (2006/2005) + (2006/2007)

let me calculate each fraction:

2006/2005 is slightly more than 1, specifically 1 + (1/2005)

similarly, 2006/2007 is slightly less than 1, specifically 1 - (1/2007)

so a is approximately 1 + 1/2005 + 1 - 1/2007 = 2 + (1/2005 - 1/2007)

i can compute 1/2005 - 1/2007:

1/2005 - 1/2007 = (2007 - 2005)/(2005*2007) = 2/(2005*2007)

that's a positive number, so a is slightly more than 2.

now expression b: (2006/2007) + (2008/2007)

both fractions have the same denominator, 2007.

so b = (2006 + 2008)/2007 = 4014/2007

wait, 2007 times 2 is 4014, so 4014/2007 = 2

so b is exactly 2.

expression c: (2007/2006) + (2007/2008)

similar to a, but with different numbers.

2007/2006 is 1 + (1/2006)

2007/2008 is 1 - (1/2008)

so c is approximately 1 + 1/2006 + 1 - 1/2008 = 2 + (1/2006 - 1/2008)

again, 1/2006 - 1/2008 = (2008 - 2006)/(2006*2008) = 2/(2006*2008)

this is also positive, so c is slightly more than 2.

now, both a and c are slightly more than 2, while b is exactly 2.

so, between a and c, which one is larger?

i need to compare the differences:

for a: 2 + 2/(2005*2007)

for c: 2 + 2/(2006*2008)

so, which is larger: 2/(2005*2007) or 2/(2006*2008)?

well, 2005*2007 = let's calculate that.

2005*2007 = (2000 + 5)(2000 + 7) = 2000*2000 + 2000*7 + 5*2000 + 5*7 = 4,000,000 + 14,000 + 10,000 + 35 = 4,024,035

similarly, 2006*2008 = (2000 + 6)(2000 + 8) = 2000*2000 + 2000*8 + 6*2000 + 6*8 = 4,000,000 + 16,000 + 12,000 + 48 = 4,028,048

so, 2/(4,024,035) versus 2/(4,028,048)

since the denominators are larger for c, the fraction for c is smaller.

therefore, 2/(2005*2007) > 2/(2006*2008)

so a is slightly more than c, which is slightly more than b.

therefore, a > c > b

so the largest is a.

wait, but let me double-check.

alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compare a and c without calculating the exact denominators.

notice that a is (2006/2005) + (2006/2007)

c is (2007/2006) + (2007/2008)

let me consider that 2006/2005 = 1 + 1/2005

2007/2006 = 1 + 1/2006

similarly, 2006/2007 = 1 - 1/2007

2007/2008 = 1 - 1/2008

so, a = (1 + 1/2005) + (1 - 1/2007) = 2 + (1/2005 - 1/2007)

c = (1 + 1/2006) + (1 - 1/2008) = 2 + (1/2006 - 1/2008)

now, 1/2005 - 1/2007 = (2007 - 2005)/(2005*2007) = 2/(2005*2007)

1/2006 - 1/2008 = (2008 - 2006)/(2006*2008) = 2/(2006*2008)

since 2005*2007 < 2006*2008, because 2005 < 2006 and 2007 < 2008, their product is smaller.

therefore, 2/(2005*2007) > 2/(2006*2008)

thus, a has a larger addition over 2 than c does.

therefore, a > c > b.

so the largest is a.
