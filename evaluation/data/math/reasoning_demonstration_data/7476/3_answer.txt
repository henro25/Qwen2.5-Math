Answer: Given the tetrahedron \(abcd\) with faces \(abc\) and \(bcd\) meeting at an angle of \(30^\circ\), the areas of faces \(abc\) and \(bcd\) are 120 and 80 respectively, and the length of edge \(bc\) is 10. we need to find the volume of the tetrahedron.

first, we use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron when given the areas of two adjacent faces, the length of their common edge, and the dihedral angle between them:

\[
v = \frac{2 \times \text{area of } abc \times \text{area of } bcd \times \sin(\theta)}{3 \times bc}
\]

plugging in the given values:

\[
v = \frac{2 \times 120 \times 80 \times \sin(30^\circ)}{3 \times 10}
\]

since \(\sin(30^\circ) = 0.5\):

\[
v = \frac{2 \times 120 \times 80 \times 0.5}{30}
\]

simplifying the numerator:

\[
2 \times 120 \times 80 \times 0.5 = 9600
\]

then:

\[
v = \frac{9600}{30} = 320
\]

thus, the volume of the tetrahedron is:

\[
\boxed{320}
\]
