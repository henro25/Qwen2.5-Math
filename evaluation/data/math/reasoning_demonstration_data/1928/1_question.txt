Problem: There is only one value of $k$ for which the line $x=k$ intersects the graphs of $y=x^2+6x+5$ and $y=mx+b$ at two points which are exactly $5$ units apart. If the line $y=mx+b$ passes through the point $(1,6)$, and $b\neq 0$, find the equation of the line.  Enter your answer in the form "$y = mx + b$".
