Reasoning: Okay, so I have this problem here. It says that two-thirds of the people in a room are seated in three-fourths of the chairs, and the rest are standing. There are 6 empty chairs, and I need to find out how many people are in the room. Alright, let's break this down.

First, let's try to understand what's being said. There are some people in a room, and two-thirds of them are sitting down, using three-fourths of the chairs available. The rest of the people are standing, which means they're not sitting in chairs. Also, there are 6 empty chairs. So, I need to figure out the total number of people based on this information.

Hmm, maybe I should start by letting some variables represent the unknowns. Let's say the total number of people in the room is P, and the total number of chairs is C.

According to the problem, two-thirds of the people are seated, so that would be (2/3)P people sitting down. These seated people are using three-fourths of the chairs, so that's (3/4)C chairs being used by them.

Wait a minute, if (2/3)P people are sitting in (3/4)C chairs, does that mean that each seated person is using one chair? I think so, unless specified otherwise, it's safe to assume that each person uses one chair when seated.

So, if (2/3)P people are sitting in (3/4)C chairs, that should mean that (2/3)P equals (3/4)C, because each seated person uses one chair. So, (2/3)P = (3/4)C.

Okay, that's one equation. Now, there are 6 empty chairs. The total number of chairs is C, and the number of chairs being used is (3/4)C, so the empty chairs would be C - (3/4)C, which is (1/4)C. According to the problem, there are 6 empty chairs, so (1/4)C = 6.

Alright, so I have two equations now:

1. (2/3)P = (3/4)C

2. (1/4)C = 6

I can solve the second equation for C. If (1/4)C = 6, then multiplying both sides by 4 gives C = 24.

So, there are 24 chairs in total.

Now, plugging C = 24 back into the first equation: (2/3)P = (3/4)*24.

Let's calculate (3/4)*24. 3 times 24 is 72, divided by 4 is 18. So, (2/3)P = 18.

Now, to find P, I can multiply both sides by (3/2). So, P = 18 * (3/2) = 27.

Therefore, there are 27 people in the room.

Wait, let me double-check that. If there are 27 people, two-thirds of them are seated, so (2/3)*27 = 18 people sitting. There are 24 chairs, and three-fourths of them are used, which is (3/4)*24 = 18 chairs occupied. That matches up.

The remaining people are standing: 27 - 18 = 9 people standing. And there are 6 empty chairs, which is consistent with the total chairs being 24, and 18 being used.

So, yes, I think 27 is the correct number of people in the room.
