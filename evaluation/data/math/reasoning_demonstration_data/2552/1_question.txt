Problem: Square $ABCD$ is inscribed in a circle. Square $EFGH$ has vertices $E$ and $F$ on $\overline{CD}$ and vertices $G$ and $H$ on the circle. If the area of square $ABCD$ is $1$, then the area of square $EFGH$ can be expressed as $\frac {m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers and $m < n$. Find $10n + m$.
