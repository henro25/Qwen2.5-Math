Reasoning: Let's dive into this problem: compute 
i
600
+
i
599
+
⋯
+
i
+
1
i 
600
 +i 
599
 +⋯+i+1, where 
i
2
=
−
1
i 
2
 =−1. hmm, okay, so we have a sum of powers of 
i
i from 
i
600
i 
600
  down to 
i
0
i 
0
 , which is 1. that's a lot of terms! there must be a smarter way to approach this than just adding them one by one.

first, i remember that 
i
i has a cyclic pattern when raised to powers. specifically, the powers of 
i
i cycle every four exponents:

i
1
=
i
,
i
2
=
−
1
,
i
3
=
−
i
,
i
4
=
1
,
i
5
=
i
,
and so on.
i 
1
 =i,i 
2
 =−1,i 
3
 =−i,i 
4
 =1,i 
5
 =i,and so on.
so, the pattern repeats every four terms: 
i
,
−
1
,
−
i
,
1
i,−1,−i,1. that's a useful property. maybe i can use this periodicity to simplify the sum.

since the cycle repeats every four powers, perhaps i can group the terms in sets of four and see if there's a pattern or cancellation happening.

let's consider the sum 
s
=
i
600
+
i
599
+
⋯
+
i
+
1
s=i 
600
 +i 
599
 +⋯+i+1. the number of terms here is 601, from 
i
0
i 
0
  to 
i
600
i 
600
 .

wait, actually, 
i
0
=
1
i 
0
 =1, and the highest exponent is 600. so, the sum is from 
i
0
i 
0
  to 
i
600
i 
600
 , inclusive, which is indeed 601 terms.

given the cyclic nature of 
i
i, let's see how many complete cycles of four there are in 601 terms.

first, divide 601 by 4:

601
÷
4
=
150
 with a remainder of 
1.
601÷4=150 with a remainder of 1.
so, there are 150 complete cycles of four terms and one extra term.

now, what's the sum of one complete cycle? let's calculate:

i
+
(
−
1
)
+
(
−
i
)
+
1
=
i
−
1
−
i
+
1
=
0.
i+(−1)+(−i)+1=i−1−i+1=0.
oh, interesting! each complete cycle of four terms sums to zero. that's a big simplification. so, 150 complete cycles would sum to zero.

then, there's one extra term left. since 150 cycles cover 
150
×
4
=
600
150×4=600 terms, the remaining term is 
i
600
i 
600
 .

so, the sum 
s
s simplifies to:

s
=
0
+
i
600
.
s=0+i 
600
 .
now, i just need to find the value of 
i
600
i 
600
 .

recall the cyclicity every four exponents. to find 
i
600
i 
600
 , divide 600 by 4:

600
÷
4
=
150
 with a remainder of 
0.
600÷4=150 with a remainder of 0.
so, 
i
600
=
i
4
×
150
=
(
i
4
)
150
=
1
150
=
1
i 
600
 =i 
4×150
 =(i 
4
 ) 
150
 =1 
150
 =1.

therefore, the sum 
s
=
0
+
1
=
1
s=0+1=1.

wait a minute, but let's double-check to make sure i didn't make any mistakes. maybe i should consider another approach to verify this result.

another way to approach this is by recognizing that the sum is a geometric series. the general form of a geometric series is:

s
=
a
+
a
r
+
a
r
2
+
⋯
+
a
r
n
−
1
,
s=a+ar+ar 
2
 +⋯+ar 
n−1
 ,
where 
a
a is the first term, 
r
r is the common ratio, and there are 
n
n terms.

in our case, the first term 
a
=
1
a=1 (which is 
i
0
i 
0
 ), the common ratio 
r
=
i
r=i, and there are 601 terms.

the sum of a geometric series is given by:

s
=
a
1
−
r
n
1
−
r
,
for 
r
≠
1.
s=a 
1−r
1−r 
n
 
​
 ,for r

=1.
applying this formula:

s
=
1
⋅
1
−
i
601
1
−
i
.
s=1⋅ 
1−i
1−i 
601
 
​
 .
hmm, but earlier i found 
s
=
1
s=1, and now i have this expression. let's see if they match.

first, compute 
i
601
i 
601
 . again, using the cyclicity:

601
÷
4
=
150
 with a remainder of 
1.
601÷4=150 with a remainder of 1.
so, 
i
601
=
i
4
×
150
+
1
=
(
i
4
)
150
⋅
i
=
1
150
⋅
i
=
i
i 
601
 =i 
4×150+1
 =(i 
4
 ) 
150
 ⋅i=1 
150
 ⋅i=i.

therefore,

s
=
1
−
i
1
−
i
.
s= 
1−i
1−i
​
 .
wait, that simplifies to 1, which matches my earlier result. okay, that's reassuring.

but let's make sure that the formula for the sum of a geometric series applies here. the formula is valid for 
r
≠
1
r

=1, and in this case, 
r
=
i
r=i, which is not equal to 1, so it should be fine.

alternatively, i can think about the sum in terms of complex numbers. since 
i
i is a complex number on the unit circle at 90 degrees, its powers correspond to rotations by multiples of 90 degrees.

but perhaps that's more advanced than necessary for this problem.

another way to look at it is to pair the terms in the sum. for example, pairing 
i
k
i 
k
  with 
i
k
+
2
i 
k+2
 , since 
i
k
+
2
=
i
k
⋅
i
2
=
i
k
⋅
(
−
1
)
=
−
i
k
i 
k+2
 =i 
k
 ⋅i 
2
 =i 
k
 ⋅(−1)=−i 
k
 .

so, 
i
k
+
i
k
+
2
=
i
k
−
i
k
=
0
i 
k
 +i 
k+2
 =i 
k
 −i 
k
 =0.

this suggests that every pair of terms two apart cancel each other out.

but in this sum, there are 601 terms, which is an odd number, so one term would be left unpaired.

given that, most terms would cancel out, leaving only one term, which in this case seems to be 1, as previously found.

wait, but let's see: for example, pairing 
i
600
i 
600
  with 
i
598
i 
598
 , 
i
599
i 
599
  with 
i
597
i 
597
 , and so on, down to 
i
2
i 
2
  with 
i
0
i 
0
 , leaving 
i
1
i 
1
  unpaired.

wait, but in this pairing, each pair would be 
i
k
+
i
k
−
2
=
i
k
+
i
k
−
2
i 
k
 +i 
k−2
 =i 
k
 +i 
k−2
 . hmm, i need to be careful here.

alternatively, perhaps considering the sum as a geometric series is the most straightforward approach, and since both methods give the same result, i can be confident that 
s
=
1
s=1.

just to be thorough, let's consider a smaller example to verify the method.

suppose i have 
s
=
i
3
+
i
2
+
i
+
1
s=i 
3
 +i 
2
 +i+1.

using the cycle approach:

i
3
=
−
i
i 
3
 =−i, 
i
2
=
−
1
i 
2
 =−1, 
i
1
=
i
i 
1
 =i, 
i
0
=
1
i 
0
 =1.

sum: 
−
i
−
1
+
i
+
1
=
0
−i−1+i+1=0.

using the geometric series formula:

s
=
1
−
i
4
1
−
i
=
1
−
1
1
−
i
=
0
s= 
1−i
1−i 
4
 
​
 = 
1−i
1−1
​
 =0.

okay, that matches.

another example: 
s
=
i
2
+
i
+
1
s=i 
2
 +i+1.

using the cycle approach:

i
2
=
−
1
i 
2
 =−1, 
i
1
=
i
i 
1
 =i, 
i
0
=
1
i 
0
 =1.

sum: 
−
1
+
i
+
1
=
i
−1+i+1=i.

using the geometric series formula:

s
=
1
−
i
3
1
−
i
=
1
−
(
−
i
)
1
−
i
=

i

−

s= 
1−i
1−i 
3
 
​
 = 
1−i
1−(−i)
​
 = 
1−i
1+i
​
 .

multiply numerator and denominator by 
1
+
i
1+i:

(
1
+
i
)
(
1
+
i
)
(
1
−
i
)
(
1
+
i
)
=

(1−i)(1+i)
(1+i)(1+i)
​
 = 
1−i

1+2i+i 
2
 
​
 = 
1−(−1)
1+2i−1
​
 = 
2
2i
​
 =i.
again, it matches. so, the method seems sound.

therefore, returning to the original problem, the sum 
s
=
i
600
+
i
599
+
⋯
+
i
+
1
=
1
s=i 
600
 +i 
599
 +⋯+i+1=1.
