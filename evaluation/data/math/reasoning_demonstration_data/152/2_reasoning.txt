Reasoning: So i have this problem here: i need to find the value of m + b, where m and b are the slope and y-intercept of a line y = mx + b. the reflection of the point (-3, -1) across this line is the point (5, 3).

first, i need to recall what it means to reflect a point across a line. when you reflect a point across a line, the line is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the original point and its image. that means that the line y = mx + b is perpendicular to the line segment connecting (-3, -1) and (5, 3), and it passes through the midpoint of that segment.

so, maybe i can start by finding the midpoint of the segment connecting (-3, -1) and (5, 3). the midpoint formula is ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2). plugging in the values, the midpoint m would be ((-3 + 5)/2, (-1 + 3)/2), which is (2/2, 2/2) = (1, 1). so, the line y = mx + b must pass through the point (1, 1).

next, since the line y = mx + b is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting (-3, -1) and (5, 3), its slope m should be the negative reciprocal of the slope of the segment.

let me find the slope of the segment connecting (-3, -1) and (5, 3). the slope formula is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). plugging in the values, it's (3 - (-1))/(5 - (-3)) = (4)/(8) = 0.5. so, the slope of the segment is 0.5.

therefore, the slope of the perpendicular line should be the negative reciprocal of 0.5, which is -1/(0.5) = -2. so, m = -2.

now that i have m, i can use the fact that the line passes through the midpoint (1, 1) to find b. plugging into the equation y = mx + b, i have 1 = (-2)(1) + b, which simplifies to 1 = -2 + b. adding 2 to both sides, b = 3.

so, m + b = -2 + 3 = 1.

wait a minute, let me double-check that. maybe i should verify if the reflection actually works out with these values.

given the line y = -2x + 3, let's see if reflecting (-3, -1) across this line gives (5, 3).

to reflect a point across a line, one way is to use the formula for reflection. the formula for reflecting a point (x, y) across the line ax + by + c = 0 is given by:

x' = x - 2a(ax + by + c)/(a² + b²)

y' = y - 2b(ax + by + c)/(a² + b²)

first, i need to write the line y = -2x + 3 in general form. that would be 2x + y - 3 = 0, so a = 2, b = 1, c = -3.

now, plugging in the point (-3, -1):

x' = -3 - 2*2*(2*(-3) + 1*(-1) - 3)/(2² + 1²) = -3 - 4*( -6 -1 -3)/5 = -3 - 4*(-10)/5 = -3 + 8 = 5

y' = -1 - 2*1*(2*(-3) + 1*(-1) - 3)/5 = -1 - 2*(-6 -1 -3)/5 = -1 - 2*(-10)/5 = -1 + 4 = 3

so, it does give (5, 3), which matches the image point. therefore, m + b = -2 + 3 = 1 seems correct.

alternatively, maybe there's a different approach to confirm this.

another way is to consider that the line y = mx + b is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining (-3, -1) and (5, 3). we already found the midpoint (1,1), and the slope m = -2.

alternatively, i could use vectors or coordinate geometry to find the reflection.

wait, another thought: perhaps i can use the formula for the reflection of a point over a line.

the formula for the reflection of a point (x0, y0) over the line y = mx + b is:

x' = [(1 - m²)x0 + 2m(y0 - b)] / (1 + m²)

y' = [2m x0 - (1 - m²)(y0 - b)] / (1 + m²) + b

let me plug in the values:

given that the reflection of (-3, -1) is (5, 3), so:

5 = [(1 - m²)(-3) + 2m( -1 - b )] / (1 + m²)

3 = [2m*(-3) - (1 - m²)( -1 - b )] / (1 + m²) + b

this seems more complicated, but maybe solving these equations will confirm m and b.

let's denote equation 1:

5(1 + m²) = (1 - m²)(-3) + 2m(-1 - b)

equation 2:

3(1 + m²) = 2m*(-3) - (1 - m²)(-1 - b) + b(1 + m²)

this seems messy. maybe i should stick with my initial approach since it already worked.

alternatively, perhaps there's a geometric interpretation.

let me consider the distance from (-3, -1) to the line y = mx + b, and the distance from (5, 3) to the same line should be equal, and the line should be the perpendicular bisector.

the formula for the distance from a point (x0, y0) to the line ax + by + c = 0 is |ax0 + by0 + c| / sqrt(a² + b²).

given the line 2x + y - 3 = 0 (from y = -2x + 3), the distance from (-3, -1):

|2*(-3) + 1*(-1) - 3| / sqrt(4 + 1) = |-6 -1 -3| / sqrt(5) = 10 / sqrt(5)

distance from (5, 3):

|2*5 + 1*3 - 3| / sqrt(5) = |10 + 3 -3| / sqrt(5) = 10 / sqrt(5)

so, distances are equal, which is consistent.

therefore, m + b = 1.
