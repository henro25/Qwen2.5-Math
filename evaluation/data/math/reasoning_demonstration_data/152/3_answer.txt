Answer: To find the value of \( m + b \) for the line \( y = mx + b \) such that the reflection of the point \((-3, -1)\) across this line is the point \((5, 3)\), we follow these steps:

1. **find the midpoint of the segment connecting \((-3, -1)\) and \((5, 3)\):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{-3 + 5}{2}, \frac{-1 + 3}{2} \right) = (1, 1)
   \]
   the line \( y = mx + b \) passes through this midpoint.

2. **determine the slope of the segment connecting \((-3, -1)\) and \((5, 3)\):**
   \[
   \text{slope} = \frac{3 - (-1)}{5 - (-3)} = \frac{4}{8} = 0.5
   \]
   the slope of the perpendicular line is the negative reciprocal:
   \[
   m = -2
   \]

3. **use the midpoint \((1, 1)\) to find \( b \):**
   \[
   1 = -2(1) + b \implies 1 = -2 + b \implies b = 3
   \]

4. **calculate \( m + b \):**
   \[
   m + b = -2 + 3 = 1
   \]

thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]
