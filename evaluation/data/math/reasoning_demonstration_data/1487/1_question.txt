Problem: Each block on the grid shown in the Figure is 1 unit by 1 unit.  Suppose we wish to walk from $A$ to $B$ via a 7 unit path, but we have to stay on the grid -- no cutting across blocks.  How many different paths can we take?[asy]size(3cm,3cm);int w=5;int h=4;int i;for (i=0; i<h; ++i){draw((0,i) -- (w-1,i));}for (i=0; i<w; ++i){draw((i, 0)--(i,h-1));}label("B", (w-1,h-1), NE);label("A", (0,0), SW);[/asy]
