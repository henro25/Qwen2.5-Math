Problem: Six congruent circles form a ring with each circle externally tangent to the two circles adjacent to it.  All six circles are internally tangent to a circle $\cal C$ with radius 30.  Let $K$ be the area of the region inside $\cal C$ and outside all of the six circles in the ring.  Find $\lfloor K\rfloor$. (The notation $\lfloor K\rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer that is less than or equal to $K$.)
