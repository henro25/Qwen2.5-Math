Reasoning: So i have this problem: "find the sum of all positive divisors of 50 that are also divisors of 15." hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

first, i need to understand what a divisor is. a divisor of a number is another number that divides it without leaving a remainder. so, for example, the divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6 because each of these numbers divides 6 evenly.

now, the problem is asking for the sum of all positive divisors of 50 that are also divisors of 15. so, i need to find numbers that are divisors of both 50 and 15, and then add them up.

to do this, maybe i should list out all the divisors of 50 and all the divisors of 15, and then find the common ones between them.

let's start with 50. to find the divisors of 50, i can list all the numbers that divide 50 without leaving a remainder.

starting from 1:

1 divides 50 because 50 ÷ 1 = 50.

2 divides 50 because 50 ÷ 2 = 25.

3? 50 ÷ 3 is not a whole number, so no.

4? 50 ÷ 4 = 12.5, which is not a whole number.

5? 50 ÷ 5 = 10, so yes.

6? 50 ÷ 6 is not a whole number.

7? 50 ÷ 7 is not a whole number.

8? 50 ÷ 8 = 6.25, not a whole number.

9? 50 ÷ 9 is not a whole number.

10? 50 ÷ 10 = 5, so yes.

11? 50 ÷ 11 is not a whole number.

12? 50 ÷ 12 is not a whole number.

13? 50 ÷ 13 is not a whole number.

14? 50 ÷ 14 is not a whole number.

15? 50 ÷ 15 is not a whole number.

25? 50 ÷ 25 = 2, so yes.

50? 50 ÷ 50 = 1, so yes.

so, the positive divisors of 50 are: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50.

now, let's find the positive divisors of 15.

starting from 1:

1 divides 15 because 15 ÷ 1 = 15.

2? 15 ÷ 2 is not a whole number.

3? 15 ÷ 3 = 5, so yes.

4? 15 ÷ 4 is not a whole number.

5? 15 ÷ 5 = 3, so yes.

6? 15 ÷ 6 is not a whole number.

15? 15 ÷ 15 = 1, so yes.

so, the positive divisors of 15 are: 1, 3, 5, and 15.

now, i need to find the common divisors of 50 and 15, which are the numbers that appear in both lists.

looking at the two lists:

divisors of 50: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50

divisors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15

the common divisors are 1 and 5.

now, the problem asks for the sum of these common divisors.

so, i need to add 1 and 5 together.

1 + 5 = 6.

therefore, the sum of all positive divisors of 50 that are also divisors of 15 is 6.

wait a minute, is there another way to approach this problem? maybe by finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 50 and 15 and then finding the sum of its divisors?

let me try that.

first, find the gcd of 50 and 15.

to find the gcd, i can use the prime factorization method.

prime factorization of 50:

50 = 2 × 25

25 = 5 × 5

so, 50 = 2 × 5 × 5

prime factorization of 15:

15 = 3 × 5

now, the gcd is the product of the lowest powers of common prime factors.

the common prime factor between 50 and 15 is 5.

so, gcd(50, 15) = 5.

now, the divisors of the gcd will be the common divisors of both numbers.

divisors of 5 are 1 and 5, which matches what i found earlier.

now, sum of divisors of 5 is 1 + 5 = 6.

so, again, i get the same answer, which is reassuring.

is there any other method i can use to verify this?

perhaps using the formula for the sum of divisors.

i recall that for a number n with prime factorization n = p₁^a × p₂^b × ... × p_k^c, the sum of its divisors is (p₁^(a+1) - 1)/(p₁ - 1) × (p₂^(b+1) - 1)/(p₂ - 1) × ... × (p_k^(c+1) - 1)/(p_k - 1).

but in this case, since we're dealing with the gcd, and its divisors are straightforward, i think the method i used is sufficient.

alternatively, maybe i can list out the multiples or something, but that seems more complicated.

no, i think listing the divisors is the most straightforward approach for this problem.

just to be thorough, let's check if there are any other common divisors that i might have missed.

divisors of 50: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50

divisors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15

looking at these, the only numbers that appear in both lists are 1 and 5.

adding them up gives 6, which seems correct.

is there any chance that 50 and 15 have a common divisor larger than 5?

well, 5 is the gcd, and since 5 is prime, its only divisors are 1 and itself, so no, there are no larger common divisors.

therefore, the sum should indeed be 6.

i think that's the answer.

**final answer**

6
