Answer: To find the sum of all positive divisors of 50 that are also divisors of 15, we start by listing the divisors of each number.

the positive divisors of 50 are:
\[ 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 \]

the positive divisors of 15 are:
\[ 1, 3, 5, 15 \]

the common divisors of 50 and 15 are:
\[ 1, 5 \]

next, we sum these common divisors:
\[ 1 + 5 = 6 \]

therefore, the sum of all positive divisors of 50 that are also divisors of 15 is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
