Reasoning: So i've got this problem about a pentagon with some given angles and some relationships between the others. let me try to make sense of it step by step.

first, i know that the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is... hmm, for any polygon, the sum of the interior angles is 
(
n
−
2
)
×
18
0
∘
(n−2)×180 
∘
 , where 
n
n is the number of sides. so for a pentagon, 
n
=
5
n=5, so it's 
(
5
−
2
)
×
18
0
∘
=
3
×
18
0
∘
=
54
0
∘
(5−2)×180 
∘
 =3×180 
∘
 =540 
∘
 . got it.

now, the problem says that two of the interior angles, 
a
a and 
b
b, are 
6
0
∘
60 
∘
  and 
8
5
∘
85 
∘
  respectively. so, 
a
=
6
0
∘
a=60 
∘
  and 
b
=
8
5
∘
b=85 
∘
 . that means the sum of these two angles is 
6
0
∘
+
8
5
∘
=
14
5
∘
60 
∘
 +85 
∘
 =145 
∘
 .

next, it mentions that two of the remaining angles, 
c
c and 
d
d, are equal. so, 
c
=
d
c=d.

the fifth angle, 
e
e, is 
1
5
∘
15 
∘
  more than twice 
c
c. so, 
e
=
2
c
+
1
5
∘
e=2c+15 
∘
 .

since the sum of all interior angles is 
54
0
∘
540 
∘
 , i can set up an equation:

a
+
b
+
c
+
d
+
e
=
54
0
∘
a+b+c+d+e=540 
∘
 
substituting the known values:

6
0
∘
+
8
5
∘
+
c
+
c
+
(
2
c
+
1
5
∘
)
=
54
0
∘
60 
∘
 +85 
∘
 +c+c+(2c+15 
∘
 )=540 
∘
 
simplify the left side:

6
0
∘
+
8
5
∘
=
14
5
∘
60 
∘
 +85 
∘
 =145 
∘
 
c
+
c
=
2
c
c+c=2c
2
c
+
1
5
∘
=
2
c
+
1
5
∘
2c+15 
∘
 =2c+15 
∘
 
so, combining them:

14
5
∘
+
2
c
+
2
c
+
1
5
∘
=
54
0
∘
145 
∘
 +2c+2c+15 
∘
 =540 
∘
 
wait, that seems off. let me check that again.

actually, it should be:

6
0
∘
+
8
5
∘
+
c
+
c
+
(
2
c
+
1
5
∘
)
=
54
0
∘
60 
∘
 +85 
∘
 +c+c+(2c+15 
∘
 )=540 
∘
 
which is:

14
5
∘
+
2
c
+
2
c
+
1
5
∘
=
54
0
∘
145 
∘
 +2c+2c+15 
∘
 =540 
∘
 
but that's not correct because 
c
+
c
=
2
c
c+c=2c and 
e
=
2
c
+
1
5
∘
e=2c+15 
∘
 , so total should be 
14
5
∘
+
2
c
+
2
c
+
1
5
∘
145 
∘
 +2c+2c+15 
∘
 , but wait, no, it's 
14
5
∘
+
c
+
d
+
e
145 
∘
 +c+d+e, and since 
c
=
d
c=d, it's 
14
5
∘
+
c
+
c
+
(
2
c
+
1
5
∘
)
145 
∘
 +c+c+(2c+15 
∘
 ), which is 
14
5
∘
+
2
c
+
2
c
+
1
5
∘
145 
∘
 +2c+2c+15 
∘
 , but that's not right because 
e
e is only 
2
c
+
1
5
∘
2c+15 
∘
 , not 
2
c
+
1
5
∘
2c+15 
∘
  plus something else.

wait, perhaps i should just combine all terms properly.

let's try again:

6
0
∘
+
8
5
∘
+
c
+
c
+
(
2
c
+
1
5
∘
)
=
54
0
∘
60 
∘
 +85 
∘
 +c+c+(2c+15 
∘
 )=540 
∘
 
combine like terms:

60
+
85
=
145
60+85=145

c
+
c
=
2
c
c+c=2c

2
c
+
1
5
∘
2c+15 
∘
  remains.

so total is:

14
5
∘
+
2
c
+
2
c
+
1
5
∘
=
54
0
∘
145 
∘
 +2c+2c+15 
∘
 =540 
∘
 
wait, that doesn't make sense because 
c
+
c
+
e
=
c
+
c
+
2
c
+
1
5
∘
=
4
c
+
1
5
∘
c+c+e=c+c+2c+15 
∘
 =4c+15 
∘
 , but that would make the equation:

14
5
∘
+
4
c
+
1
5
∘
=
54
0
∘
145 
∘
 +4c+15 
∘
 =540 
∘
 
yes, that seems better.

so:

14
5
∘
+
4
c
+
1
5
∘
=
54
0
∘
145 
∘
 +4c+15 
∘
 =540 
∘
 
combine the constants:

16
0
∘
+
4
c
=
54
0
∘
160 
∘
 +4c=540 
∘
 
now, subtract 
16
0
∘
160 
∘
  from both sides:

4
c
=
54
0
∘
−
16
0
∘
4c=540 
∘
 −160 
∘
 
4
c
=
38
0
∘
4c=380 
∘
 
then, divide both sides by 4:

c
=
38
0
∘
4
c= 
4
380 
∘
 
​
 
c
=
9
5
∘
c=95 
∘
 
so, 
c
=
d
=
9
5
∘
c=d=95 
∘
 , since they are equal.

now, 
e
=
2
c
+
1
5
∘
=
2
×
9
5
∘
+
1
5
∘
=
19
0
∘
+
1
5
∘
=
20
5
∘
e=2c+15 
∘
 =2×95 
∘
 +15 
∘
 =190 
∘
 +15 
∘
 =205 
∘
 .

let me verify that the sum is indeed 
54
0
∘
540 
∘
 :

a
+
b
+
c
+
d
+
e
=
6
0
∘
+
8
5
∘
+
9
5
∘
+
9
5
∘
+
20
5
∘
a+b+c+d+e=60 
∘
 +85 
∘
 +95 
∘
 +95 
∘
 +205 
∘
 
=
(
60
+
85
)
+
(
95
+
95
)
+
205
=(60+85)+(95+95)+205
=
14
5
∘
+
19
0
∘
+
20
5
∘
=145 
∘
 +190 
∘
 +205 
∘
 
=
(
145
+
190
)
+
205
=(145+190)+205
=
33
5
∘
+
20
5
∘
=335 
∘
 +205 
∘
 
=
54
0
∘
=540 
∘
 
perfect, that checks out.

now, the problem asks for the measure of the largest angle. let's see:

- 
a
=
6
0
∘
a=60 
∘
 

- 
b
=
8
5
∘
b=85 
∘
 

- 
c
=
9
5
∘
c=95 
∘
 

- 
d
=
9
5
∘
d=95 
∘
 

- 
e
=
20
5
∘
e=205 
∘
 

so, the largest angle is 
e
=
20
5
∘
e=205 
∘
 .

i think that's the answer.

**final answer**

20
5
∘
205
