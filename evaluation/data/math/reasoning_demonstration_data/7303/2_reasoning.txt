Reasoning: Okay, so I have this equation here: a plus a over 3 equals 8 over 3. I need to find out what a is. Alright, let's see. So, a plus a over 3 is the same as a + (a/3). I need to solve for a.

First, maybe I should combine like terms. So, a is the same as 3a over 3, right? Because if I have a, that's like 3a divided by 3. So, 3a/3 + a/3 would be (3a + a)/3, which is 4a/3. So, 4a/3 equals 8/3.

Now, I have 4a/3 = 8/3. To solve for a, I can probably get rid of the denominators first. Since both sides have a denominator of 3, maybe I can multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fractions. So, 3 * (4a/3) equals 3 * (8/3). On the left side, 3 cancels out with the denominator, leaving me with 4a. On the right side, 3 cancels out with the denominator, leaving me with 8. So now I have 4a = 8.

Next, to find a, I need to divide both sides by 4. So, a equals 8 divided by 4, which is 2. So, a is 2.

Wait, let me check if that makes sense. If a is 2, then a plus a over 3 should be 2 plus 2/3. 2 is the same as 6/3, so 6/3 plus 2/3 is 8/3, which matches the original equation. So, yeah, a is 2.
