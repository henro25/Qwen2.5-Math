Answer: To solve for \( a \), we start with the equation:

\[
a + \frac{a}{3} = \frac{8}{3}
\]

First, we combine like terms. Rewriting \( a \) as \( \frac{3a}{3} \), we get:

\[
\frac{3a}{3} + \frac{a}{3} = \frac{4a}{3}
\]

So, the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{4a}{3} = \frac{8}{3}
\]

Next, we multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominators:

\[
4a = 8
\]

Finally, dividing both sides by 4:

\[
a = 2
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]
