Answer: To determine the number of ways to choose a President and a Vice-President from a group of 5 people, where they cannot be the same person, follow these steps:

1. **Choose the President**: There are 5 possible choices for the President.
2. **Choose the Vice-President**: After selecting the President, there are 4 remaining people to choose from for the Vice-President.

Since the positions of President and Vice-President are distinct, the order in which they are selected matters. Therefore, for each choice of President, there are 4 choices for Vice-President.

The total number of ways to make these selections is:

\[
5 \times 4 = 20
\]

Hence, there are **20** ways to choose a President and a Vice-President from a group of 5 people.
