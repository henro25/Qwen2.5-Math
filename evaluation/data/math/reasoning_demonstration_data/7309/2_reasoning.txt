Reasoning: So i have this equation here: 
2
8
=
1
6
x
2 
8
 =16 
x
 , and i need to find the value of 
x
x. hmm, okay, let's see. i know that both 2 and 16 are powers of 2, which might be helpful.

first, i should probably express 16 in terms of 2 to make the equation easier to work with. i remember that 
16
16 is 
2
4
2 
4
  because 
2
×
2
×
2
×
2
=
16
2×2×2×2=16. so, i can rewrite 
1
6
x
16 
x
  as 
(
2
4
)
x
(2 
4
 ) 
x
 .

now, the equation looks like this: 
2
8
=
(
2
4
)
x
2 
8
 =(2 
4
 ) 
x
 . i recall that when you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. so, 
(
2
4
)
x
=
2
4
x
(2 
4
 ) 
x
 =2 
4x
 .

that means the equation is now 
2
8
=
2
4
x
2 
8
 =2 
4x
 . since the bases are the same and both sides are equal, their exponents must be equal. so, 
8
=
4
x
8=4x.

to solve for 
x
x, i can divide both sides of the equation by 4. that gives me 
x
=
8
4
=
2
x= 
4
8
​	
 =2.

wait a second, let me double-check that to make sure i didn't make a mistake. if 
x
=
2
x=2, then 
1
6
2
=
(
2
4
)
2
=
2
8
16 
2
 =(2 
4
 ) 
2
 =2 
8
 , which matches the left side of the equation. so, it seems correct.

alternatively, i could take the logarithm of both sides to solve for 
x
x, but that might be unnecessary since the bases are already the same. but just to be thorough, let's try that method as well.

taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides: 
log
⁡
2
(
2
8
)
=
log
⁡
2
(
1
6
x
)
log 
2
​	
 (2 
8
 )=log 
2
​	
 (16 
x
 ).

simplifying, we get 
8
=
x
⋅
log
⁡
2
(
16
)
8=x⋅log 
2
​	
 (16).

i know that 
log
⁡
2
(
16
)
=
4
log 
2
​	
 (16)=4 because 
2
4
=
16
2 
4
 =16. so, 
8
=
4
x
8=4x, and again, 
x
=
2
x=2.

okay, both methods give me the same answer, so i'm confident that 
x
=
2
x=2 is correct.

another way to think about it is to express both sides with the same base, which i already did, but maybe i can try expressing 2 in terms of 16 to see if that leads me to the same result.

so, 
2
=
1
6
1
/
4
2=16 
1/4
 , because 
1
6
1
/
4
=
(
2
4
)
1
/
4
=
2
4
⋅
(
1
/
4
)
=
2
1
=
2
16 
1/4
 =(2 
4
 ) 
1/4
 =2 
4⋅(1/4)
 =2 
1
 =2.

then, 
2
8
=
(
1
6
1
/
4
)
8
=
1
6
(
1
/
4
)
⋅
8
=
1
6
2
2 
8
 =(16 
1/4
 ) 
8
 =16 
(1/4)⋅8
 =16 
2
 .

so, 
2
8
=
1
6
2
2 
8
 =16 
2
 , which again shows that 
x
=
2
x=2.

i think that's enough checking. i'm pretty sure the answer is 
x
=
2
x=2.

**final answer**
