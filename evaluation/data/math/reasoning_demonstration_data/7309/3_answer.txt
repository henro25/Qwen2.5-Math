Answer: Given the equation \(2^8 = 16^x\), we need to find the value of \(x\).

first, we express 16 as a power of 2:
\[ 16 = 2^4 \]

substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[ 2^8 = (2^4)^x \]

using the property of exponents \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\), we can rewrite the right-hand side:
\[ 2^8 = 2^{4x} \]

since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:
\[ 8 = 4x \]

solving for \(x\), we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = \frac{8}{4} = 2 \]

thus, the value of \(x\) is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]
