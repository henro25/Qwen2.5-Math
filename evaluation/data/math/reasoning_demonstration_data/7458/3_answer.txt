Answer: To find the largest value of \( c \) such that \( 1 \) is in the range of \( f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c \), we need to ensure that the equation \( f(x) = 1 \) has at least one real solution. this means solving:

\[ x^2 - 5x + c = 1 \]

rewriting it in standard quadratic form:

\[ x^2 - 5x + (c - 1) = 0 \]

the discriminant \( d \) of this quadratic equation must be non-negative for real solutions to exist. the discriminant is given by:

\[ d = b^2 - 4ac \]

here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -5 \), and \( c = c - 1 \). thus,

\[ d = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(c - 1) = 25 - 4(c - 1) = 25 - 4c + 4 = 29 - 4c \]

for real solutions, we need:

\[ 29 - 4c \geq 0 \]

solving for \( c \):

\[ 29 - 4c \geq 0 \]
\[ -4c \geq -29 \]
\[ c \leq \frac{29}{4} \]

therefore, the largest value of \( c \) is \( \frac{29}{4} \). to confirm, if \( c = \frac{29}{4} \), the discriminant is zero, indicating exactly one real solution:

\[ x^2 - 5x + \frac{25}{4} = 0 \]
\[ \left(x - \frac{5}{2}\right)^2 = 0 \]
\[ x = \frac{5}{2} \]

this confirms that \( 1 \) is in the range of \( f(x) \) when \( c = \frac{29}{4} \).

thus, the largest value of \( c \) such that \( 1 \) is in the range of \( f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c \) is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{29}{4}}
\]
