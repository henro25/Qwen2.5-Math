Reasoning: So i need to find the largest value of 
c
c such that 
1
1 is in the range of the function 
f
(
x
)
=
x
2
−
5
x
+
c
f(x)=x 
2
 −5x+c. hmm, okay, let's start by understanding what it means for 
1
1 to be in the range of this function.

the range of a function is all the possible output values (y-values) that the function can produce. so, if 
1
1 is in the range of 
f
(
x
)
f(x), that means there exists some 
x
x such that 
f
(
x
)
=
1
f(x)=1. in other words, the equation 
x
2
−
5
x
+
c
=
1
x 
2
 −5x+c=1 has at least one real solution for 
x
x.

alright, so i need to solve the equation 
x
2
−
5
x
+
c
=
1
x 
2
 −5x+c=1 for 
x
x, and i want this equation to have real solutions. i know that for a quadratic equation 
a
x
2
+
b
x
+
c
=
0
ax 
2
 +bx+c=0, the discriminant 
d
=
b
2
−
4
a
c
d=b 
2
 −4ac determines the nature of the roots. if 
d
≥
0
d≥0, then the equation has real solutions.

so, let's rewrite the equation 
x
2
−
5
x
+
c
=
1
x 
2
 −5x+c=1 in the standard quadratic form:

x
2
−
5
x
+
(
c
−
1
)
=
0
x 
2
 −5x+(c−1)=0

here, 
a
=
1
a=1, 
b
=
−
5
b=−5, and 
c
=
c
−
1
c=c−1. the discriminant is:

d
=
(
−
5
)
2
−
4
(
1
)
(
c
−
1
)
=
25
−
4
(
c
−
1
)
=
25
−
4
c
+
4
=
29
−
4
c
d=(−5) 
2
 −4(1)(c−1)=25−4(c−1)=25−4c+4=29−4c

for the equation to have real solutions, we need 
d
≥
0
d≥0:

29
−
4
c
≥
0
29−4c≥0

now, let's solve for 
c
c:

29
−
4
c
≥
0
29−4c≥0

−
4
c
≥
−
29
−4c≥−29

c
≤
29
4
c≤ 
4
29
​	
   (remember, when we divide by a negative number, the inequality sign flips)

so, the largest possible value of 
c
c is 
29
4
4
29
​	
 , because if 
c
c is larger than that, the discriminant becomes negative, and there are no real solutions, meaning 
1
1 is not in the range of 
f
(
x
)
f(x).

let me double-check this reasoning. if 
c
=
29
4
c= 
4
29
​	
 , then the discriminant is:

d
=
29
−
4
(
29
4
)
=
29
−
29
=
0
d=29−4( 
4
29
​	
 )=29−29=0

a discriminant of zero means there's exactly one real solution, which still satisfies the condition that 
1
1 is in the range.

if 
c
c is less than 
29
4
4
29
​	
 , the discriminant is positive, meaning there are two distinct real solutions, which also means 
1
1 is in the range.

if 
c
c is greater than 
29
4
4
29
​	
 , the discriminant is negative, and there are no real solutions, so 
1
1 is not in the range.

therefore, the largest value of 
c
c for which 
1
1 is in the range of 
f
(
x
)
=
x
2
−
5
x
+
c
f(x)=x 
2
 −5x+c is indeed 
29
4
4
29
​	
 .

wait a minute, just to be thorough, let's plug 
c
=
29
4
c= 
4
29
​	
  back into the original function and see if 
f
(
x
)
=
1
f(x)=1 has a solution.

so, 
f
(
x
)
=
x
2
−
5
x
+
29
4
f(x)=x 
2
 −5x+ 
4
29
​	
 , and we set this equal to 1:

x
2
−
5
x
+
29
4
=
1
x 
2
 −5x+ 
4
29
​	
 =1

subtract 1 from both sides:

x
2
−
5
x
+
29
4
−
1
=
0
x 
2
 −5x+ 
4
29
​	
 −1=0

x
2
−
5
x
+
25
4
=
0
x 
2
 −5x+ 
4
25
​	
 =0

this can be rewritten as:

(
x
−
5
2
)
2
=
0
(x− 
2
5
​	
 ) 
2
 =0

so, 
x
=
5
2
x= 
2
5
​	
  is the only solution, which confirms that when 
c
=
29
4
c= 
4
29
​	
 , 
f
(
x
)
=
1
f(x)=1 has exactly one real solution.

if i choose a value of 
c
c larger than 
29
4
4
29
​	
 , say 
c
=
8
c=8, then:

f
(
x
)
=
x
2
−
5
x
+
8
f(x)=x 
2
 −5x+8

set this equal to 1:

x
2
−
5
x
+
8
=
1
x 
2
 −5x+8=1

x
2
−
5
x
+
7
=
0
x 
2
 −5x+7=0

the discriminant here is:

d
=
(
−
5
)
2
−
4
(
1
)
(
7
)
=
25
−
28
=
−
3
d=(−5) 
2
 −4(1)(7)=25−28=−3

since 
d
<
0
d<0, there are no real solutions, meaning 
1
1 is not in the range of 
f
(
x
)
f(x) when 
c
=
8
c=8, which aligns with our earlier conclusion.

therefore, the largest value of 
c
c such that 
1
1 is in the range of 
f
(
x
)
=
x
2
−
5
x
+
c
f(x)=x 
2
 −5x+c is 
29
4
4
29
​	
 .
