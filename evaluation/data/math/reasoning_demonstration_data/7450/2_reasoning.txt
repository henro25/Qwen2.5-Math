Reasoning: So i've got this problem here. it involves vectors and determinants, and i need to find the relationship between the determinant of a matrix with columns a, b, and c, and another matrix with columns a cross b, b cross c, and c cross a. the answer should be in the form k times d to the power of n, where d is the determinant of the original matrix.

first, let's recall some basics. the determinant of a matrix with columns a, b, and c represents the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by these vectors. the cross product of two vectors gives a vector that's perpendicular to both and its magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram spanned by those vectors.

so, the new matrix has columns that are cross products of the original vectors. i need to find the determinant of this new matrix and express it in terms of d.

let me denote the original matrix as m = [a b c], so det(m) = d.

the new matrix is m' = [a×b, b×c, c×a], and i need to find det(m').

hmm, cross products can be expressed using determinants. specifically, a×b is the determinant of a matrix with the first row as the unit vectors i, j, k, the second row as the components of a, and the third row as the components of b.

but maybe there's a better way to approach this. i recall that there's a formula involving the scalar triple product. the scalar triple product of a, b, and c is a·(b×c), which is equal to det(m).

also, there's a vector identity that relates the cross products of vectors. maybe i can use properties of determinants and cross products to find det(m').

let me consider that m' has columns a×b, b×c, and c×a. so det(m') is the scalar triple product of a×b, b×c, and c×a.

that is, det(m') = (a×b)·[(b×c)×(c×a)].

wait, that seems complicated. maybe there's a simpler identity i can use.

i recall that for any vectors u, v, w, the scalar triple product u·(v×w) is equal to det([u v w]).

also, there's an identity for the double cross product: (v×w)×(x×y) = [v·(x×y)]w - [w·(x×y)]v.

but that might not be directly helpful here. maybe i should look for a way to express det(m') in terms of det(m).

let me think about the relationship between the cross product and the determinant.

i know that a×b is perpendicular to both a and b, and its magnitude is |a||b|sinθ, where θ is the angle between a and b.

but perhaps i should consider expressing m' in terms of m.

wait a second, maybe i can consider the matrix m' in terms of m and some other operations.

i recall that for any invertible matrix m, det(m^t) = det(m), and det(m^{-1}) = 1/det(m).

but m' is not directly related to m in a simple transpose or inverse way.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the gram matrix or something like that, but that might be overcomplicating.

let me try computing det(m') directly for a specific case, say, with specific vectors a, b, and c, and see if i can spot a pattern.

suppose a, b, and c are the standard basis vectors: a = i, b = j, c = k.

then a×b = i×j = k, b×c = j×k = i, and c×a = k×i = j.

so m' = [k, i, j], and det(m') = det([k, i, j]).

in terms of components, k is (0,0,1), i is (1,0,0), and j is (0,1,0).

so the matrix is:

| 0 1 0 |

| 0 0 1 |

| 1 0 0 |

the determinant of this matrix is 0*(0*0 - 1*0) - 1*(0*0 - 1*1) + 0*(0*0 - 0*1) = 0 - 1*(-1) + 0 = 1.

now, d = det(m) for m = [i, j, k] is 1.

so in this case, det(m') = 1 and d = 1, so det(m') = 1 * d^1.

hmm, but this is just one specific case. i need a general solution.

maybe i can consider the general formula for the determinant of m'.

let me denote m' = [a×b, b×c, c×a].

i need to compute det(m').

alternatively, perhaps i can recall that the cross product can be expressed using the determinant:

a×b = |i  j  k|

|a1 a2 a3|

|b1 b2 b3|

similarly for b×c and c×a.

but plugging these into m' and computing the determinant seems messy.

alternatively, perhaps there's a property of determinants involving cross products.

wait, i recall that for any vectors u, v, w, the determinant of [u×v, v×w, w×u] is equal to (det[m])^2, where m is [u, v, w].

is that correct?

let me check with my earlier example. in that case, d = 1, and det(m') = 1, which would suggest k = 1 and n = 1, not n=2.

but in my earlier specific case, det(m') = d^1, not d^2. maybe the identity is different.

alternatively, perhaps det(m') = d^2.

wait, in my specific case, d = 1 and det(m') = 1, which could also be 1^2.

but that doesn't help me decide between n=1 and n=2.

maybe i need to try another specific case.

let me choose a = (1,0,0), b = (0,1,0), c = (0,0,2).

then d = det(m) = 1*(1*2 - 0*0) - 0*(0*2 - 0*0) + 0*(0*0 - 1*0) = 2.

now, a×b = (0,0,1), b×c = (2,0,0), c×a = (0,2,0).

so m' = [(0,0,1), (2,0,0), (0,2,0)].

the determinant is 0*(0*0 - 0*2) - 0*(2*0 - 0*0) + 1*(2*2 - 0*0) = 0 - 0 + 1*(4) = 4.

now, d = 2, and det(m') = 4 = (2)^2.

ah, so in this case, det(m') = d^2.

but in the previous case, d=1 and det(m')=1, which is also 1^2.

so perhaps the general formula is det(m') = d^2.

but to confirm, let's try another example.

let a = (1,1,0), b = (1,0,1), c = (0,1,1).

then d = det(m) = 1*(0*1 - 1*1) - 1*(1*1 - 0*1) + 0*(1*1 - 0*0) = 1*(-1) -1*(1) + 0 = -1 -1 = -2.

now, a×b = |i j k|

|1 1 0|

|1 0 1| = i*(1*1 - 0*0) - j*(1*1 - 0*1) + k*(1*0 - 1*1) = i(1) - j(1) + k(-1) = (1,-1,-1)

similarly, b×c = |i j k|

|1 0 1|

|0 1 1| = i*(0*1 - 1*1) - j*(1*1 - 0*1) + k*(1*1 - 0*0) = i*(-1) - j*(1) + k*(1) = (-1,-1,1)

and c×a = |i j k|

|0 1 1|

|1 1 0| = i*(1*0 - 1*1) - j*(0*0 - 1*1) + k*(0*1 - 1*1) = i*(-1) - j*(-1) + k*(-1) = (-1,1,-1)

so m' = [(1,-1,-1), (-1,-1,1), (-1,1,-1)]

now, det(m') = 1*(-1*(-1) - 1*1) - (-1)*(-1*(-1) - 1*(-1)) + (-1)*(-1*1 - (-1)*(-1))

= 1*(1 - 1) - (-1)*(1 - 1) + (-1)*(-1 - 1)

= 1*(0) - (-1)*(0) + (-1)*(-2)

= 0 - 0 + 2 = 2

now, d = -2, so d^2 = 4, but det(m') = 2, which is not equal to d^2.

wait, that's a problem. in this case, det(m') = 2, and d^2 = 4.

hmm, this contradicts the earlier pattern.

alternatively, maybe i miscalculated det(m').

let me double-check the calculation of det(m').

m' = [(1,-1,-1), (-1,-1,1), (-1,1,-1)]

so det(m') = 1*(-1*(-1) - 1*1) - (-1)*(-1*(-1) - 1*(-1)) + (-1)*(-1*1 - (-1)*(-1))

= 1*(1 - 1) - (-1)*(1 - 1) + (-1)*(-1 - 1)

= 1*0 - (-1)*0 + (-1)*(-2)

= 0 - 0 + 2 = 2

yes, that's correct.

but d = -2, d^2 = 4, det(m') = 2.

so maybe det(m') = (d)^1 in this case.

wait, but in the first example, det(m') = d^2, and in the second, det(m') = d^2, but here det(m') = 2 and d^2 = 4, which is not equal.

wait, maybe i need to consider the absolute value or something.

alternatively, perhaps det(m') = (d)^n times some other factor.

wait, perhaps det(m') = (a·(b×c))^n, where n is to be determined.

but a·(b×c) is det(m) = d.

alternatively, maybe det(m') = (a·(b×c)) times something.

wait, let's think differently.

i recall that for vectors u, v, w, (u×v)·(w×x) = (u·w)(v·x) - (u·x)(v·w).

but that's the dot product of two cross products.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the identity for the scalar triple product of cross products.

i think there's an identity that says (a×b)·(c×d) = (a·c)(b·d) - (a·d)(b·c).

but i'm dealing with the determinant of a matrix whose columns are cross products.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the fact that the determinant of m' is equal to the scalar triple product (a×b)·((b×c)×(c×a)).

wait, that seems complicated.

let me see if i can find a better approach.

another idea: since m' has columns a×b, b×c, and c×a, maybe i can express m' in terms of m and some other matrices.

i recall that the cross product can be represented as a matrix multiplication with the skew-symmetric matrix of the vector.

specifically, for a vector a, the cross product a×v can be written as [a]_× v, where [a]_× is the skew-symmetric matrix:

[a]_× = |  0  -a3  a2 |

| a3   0  -a1 |

| -a2 a1   0  |

so, a×b = [a]_× b.

similarly, b×c = [b]_× c, and c×a = [c]_× a.

therefore, m' = [ [a]_× b, [b]_× c, [c]_× a ]

hmm, i'm not sure if that helps directly.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that m' is related to m via some tensor operations, but that might be too advanced.

wait, another idea: perhaps i can consider that the matrix of cross products is related to the adjugate or the cofactor matrix of m.

the adjugate of m is the transpose of the cofactor matrix, and det(m) times the adjugate of m equals m times its adjugate equals det(m) times the identity matrix.

but i'm not sure if that's helpful here.

alternatively, maybe i can consider the determinant of m' in terms of the determinants of submatrices of m.

wait, perhaps i need to recall that the cross product can be expressed in terms of determinants, and then see how that plays into the determinant of m'.

alternatively, maybe i can consider expressing m' in terms of m and some other operations and then find det(m').

wait, here's another thought: if m is the matrix with columns a, b, c, then m' has columns that are linear combinations of a, b, and c via cross products.

but cross products introduce dependencies that are not present in the original vectors, unless they are orthogonal.

this is getting complicated.

let me try to think about the relationship between m and m' in terms of linear algebra.

i know that for any vectors u, v, w, the scalar triple product u·(v×w) is equal to det([u v w]).

also, i recall that (a×b)·(c×d) = (a·c)(b·d) - (a·d)(b·c).

but here, i have three cross products in m'.

maybe there's an identity for the determinant of a matrix whose columns are cross products.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the fact that the cross product is antisymmetric and see how that affects the determinant.

this seems too vague.

let me try to consider the general expression for det(m').

so, det(m') = det([a×b, b×c, c×a]).

i need to express this in terms of det(m).

alternatively, maybe i can express m' in terms of m and some other matrices.

wait, perhaps i can use the fact that the cross product can be represented using the determinant, and then expand the determinant accordingly.

alternatively, maybe i can consider that m' is related to the hodge dual or something like that, but that might be too advanced for this problem.

let me consider a different approach: suppose that m is an invertible matrix, since det(m) ≠ 0.

then, perhaps i can express m' in terms of m^{-1} or something like that.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the relationship between the cross products and the original vectors in terms of the matrix m.

wait, maybe i can use the identity that relates the cross product of two vectors to the determinant involving those vectors.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that the matrix m' is related to m via some tensor operations, but again, that might be too complex.

wait, here's a better idea: perhaps i can consider the product m m'^t.

let me compute m m'^t and see if that leads anywhere.

m is [a b c], and m'^t is [a×b, b×c, c×a]^t, which is [a×b | b×c | c×a]^t.

wait, actually, m'^t would be a matrix where the rows are a×b, b×c, and c×a.

but i'm not sure if that helps.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider the product m'^t m.

wait, maybe that's not the way to go.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that m' is related to the adjugate matrix of m, since the adjugate involves determinants of minors, which are related to cross products in 3d.

wait, in 3d, the adjugate of m is m^{-1} det(m), assuming m is invertible.

but i'm not sure if that directly helps here.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that (a×b), (b×c), and (c×a) are all orthogonal to one of the original vectors.

for example, a×b is orthogonal to a and b, b×c is orthogonal to b and c, etc.

but again, i'm not sure how to use that to find det(m').

let me try to think differently. maybe i can consider that det(m') is equal to det(m) times some function of m.

but what function?

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that the cross product introduces a factor related to det(m).

wait, here's an idea: in three dimensions, the cross product is related to the determinant. maybe there's a way to express det(m') in terms of det(m) squared or something like that.

wait, going back to my earlier examples:

in the first case, d=1, det(m')=1.

in the second case, d=2, det(m')=4.

wait, no, in the second specific case, d=2, det(m')=4, which is d^2.

in the third case, d=-2, det(m')=2, which is not equal to d^2.

wait, but (-2)^2 is 4, but det(m')=2, which is half of d^2.

hmm, that doesn't fit.

wait, perhaps det(m') = d * (a·(b×c)).

but a·(b×c) is d, so that would be d^2.

but in the third case, d=-2, d^2=4, but det(m')=2.

again, not matching.

alternatively, maybe det(m') = d times something else.

wait, perhaps det(m') = d times the trace of something.

but that seems unlikely.

alternatively, maybe det(m') = d times the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the vectors or something like that.

but that doesn't seem right.

wait, perhaps i need to consider the relationship between the cross products and the original vectors in terms of linear transformations.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that the matrix m' is related to m via some kind of linear transformation, and then det(m') would be det(m) raised to some power times the determinant of that transformation.

but i'm not sure what that transformation would be.

let me try to consider the general expression for det(m').

so, det(m') = det([a×b, b×c, c×a]).

i need to express this in terms of det([a b c]).

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that m' is equal to m times some other matrix, and then use the multiplicative property of determinants.

but what matrix would that be?

alternatively, perhaps i can think about the fact that the cross product is a linear operation, and see if m' can be expressed as m multiplied by some matrix involving cross product operations.

this is getting too vague.

maybe i should look for a formula or identity that directly relates det([a×b, b×c, c×a]) to det([a b c]).

after some research or recall, i find that there is an identity which states that det([a×b, b×c, c×a]) = (det[m])^2.

but wait, in my third example, d=-2, so d^2=4, but det(m')=2, which doesn't match.

alternatively, maybe det(m') = (det[m])^n, where n=1 or n=2.

but in my third example, it doesn't hold for n=2.

wait, perhaps there's an absolute value involved.

in the third example, det(m')=2, which is half of d^2=4. maybe there's a factor involved.

alternatively, perhaps det(m') = d^2 / something.

wait, perhaps det(m') = d^2 / (a·(b×c)).

but a·(b×c) is d, so that would be d^2 / d = d.

but in the first example, d=1, det(m')=1, which fits d.

in the second example, d=2, det(m')=4, which would not fit d^2 / d = d.

wait, no, d^2 / d = d, which would be 2, but det(m')=4 in that case.

wait, no, in the second specific case, i had a=(1,0,0), b=(0,1,0), c=(0,0,2), d=2, det(m')=4, which is d^2.

but in the third case, d=-2, det(m')=2, which is not d^2=4.

hmm, conflicting results.

wait, perhaps i need to consider the orientation or something.

alternatively, maybe det(m') = |d|^n.

in the third case, |d|=2, |d|^2=4, but det(m')=2.

no, that doesn't fit.

alternatively, perhaps det(m') = d * something.

wait, going back to the general case, perhaps i can consider expressing a×b, b×c, and c×a in terms of m and see if there's a pattern.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that [a×b, b×c, c×a] = m [m^{-1}]^\times or something like that, but i'm not sure.

wait, perhaps i can use the fact that a×b = m [m^{-1} a] × [m^{-1} b], but that seems too convoluted.

alternatively, perhaps i can recall that in 3d, the cross product can be expressed using the hodge star operator, which relates it to the determinant.

but that might be too advanced for this problem.

wait, perhaps i can consider that the matrix [a×b, b×c, c×a] is related to the adjugate of m.

in 3d, the adjugate of m is m^{-1} det(m), assuming m is invertible.

but [a×b, b×c, c×a] seems similar to the adjugate, but not quite the same.

wait, in 3d, the adjugate matrix of m is the transpose of the cofactor matrix, which involves determinants of 2x2 submatrices of m.

but i'm not sure if that directly relates to the cross products of the columns.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that [a×b, b×c, c×a] is proportional to the adjugate of m.

in fact, in 3d, for an invertible matrix m, we have m^{-1} = adj(m)/det(m).

but again, not directly helpful.

wait, maybe i can consider the product m [a×b, b×c, c×a]^t.

let me compute m times [a×b, b×c, c×a]^t.

m is [a b c], and [a×b, b×c, c×a]^t is a matrix with rows a×b, b×c, c×a.

so m [a×b, b×c, c×a]^t = [a·(a×b), a·(b×c), a·(c×a); b·(a×b), b·(b×c), b·(c×a); c·(a×b), c·(b×c), c·(c×a)].

but a·(a×b) = 0, since a is perpendicular to a×b.

similarly, b·(b×c) = 0, and c·(c×a) = 0.

similarly, a·(b×c) = det(m), b·(c×a) = det(m), and c·(a×b) = det(m).

the other entries are zero because, for example, a·(c×a) = 0, since c×a is perpendicular to a.

so the product m [a×b, b×c, c×a]^t is a diagonal matrix with entries 0, 0, 0 in the first row, det(m), det(m), det(m) in the second row, and so on.

wait, no, actually, more carefully:

the (1,1) entry is a·(a×b) = 0

(1,2) is a·(b×c) = det(m)

(1,3) is a·(c×a) = 0

similarly,

(2,1) is b·(a×b) = 0

(2,2) is b·(b×c) = 0

(2,3) is b·(c×a) = det(m)

(3,1) is c·(a×b) = det(m)

(3,2) is c·(b×c) = 0

(3,3) is c·(c×a) = 0

so the product m [a×b, b×c, c×a]^t is:

| 0   d   0 |

| 0   0   d |

| d   0   0 |

now, the determinant of this matrix is det([0 d 0; 0 0 d; d 0 0]).

to compute this determinant, i can expand along the first row:

0 * det([0 d; d 0]) - d * det([0 d; d 0]) + 0 * det([0 0; d 0]) = -d*(0*0 - d*d) = -d*(-d^2) = d^3.

so det(m [a×b, b×c, c×a]^t) = d^3.

but det(m [a×b, b×c, c×a]^t) = det(m) det([a×b, b×c, c×a]^t) = det(m) det([a×b, b×c, c×a]).

because the determinant of a product is the product of the determinants, and the determinant of the transpose is the same as the original determinant.

so, det(m) det(m') = d^3.

therefore, det(m') = d^3 / det(m) = d^2.

wait, but in my third example, d=-2, det(m')=2, which is not d^2=4.

wait, maybe i miscalculated.

if det(m [a×b, b×c, c×a]^t) = d^3, and det(m) det(m') = d^3, then det(m') = d^3 / det(m) = d^3 / d = d^2.

but in my third example, d=-2, so d^2=4, but det(m')=2.

wait, that's a contradiction.

alternatively, perhaps i made a mistake in calculating det(m [a×b, b×c, c×a]^t).

let me recalculate the determinant of that matrix.

the matrix is:

| 0   d   0 |

| 0   0   d |

| d   0   0 |

to find its determinant, i can use the rule for 3x3 matrices.

det = 0*(0*0 - d*0) - d*(0*0 - d*d) + 0*(0*0 - 0*d) = -d*(-d^2) = d^3.

yes, that seems correct.

therefore, det(m) det(m') = d^3, so det(m') = d^3 / det(m) = d^2.

but in my third example, d=-2, det(m')=2, which is not equal to d^2=4.

wait, unless i made a mistake in calculating det(m') in that case.

let me check that again.

for a=(1,1,0), b=(1,0,1), c=(0,1,1):

a×b = (1*(1) - 0*0, 0*1 - 1*1, 1*0 - 1*1) = (1, -1, -1)

b×c = (1*(1) - 1*1, 1*0 - 0*1, 1*1 - 1*0) = (0, 0, 1)

wait, hold on, let's recalculate a×b, b×c, c×a properly.

a×b = |i j k|

|1 1 0|

|1 0 1| = i*(1*1 - 0*0) - j*(1*1 - 0*1) + k*(1*0 - 1*1) = i(1) - j(1) + k(-1) = (1,-1,-1)

b×c = |i j k|

|1 0 1|

|0 1 1| = i*(0*1 - 1*1) - j*(1*1 - 0*1) + k*(1*1 - 0*0) = i*(-1) - j*(1) + k*(1) = (-1,-1,1)

c×a = |i j k|

|0 1 1|

|1 1 0| = i*(1*0 - 1*1) - j*(0*0 - 1*1) + k*(0*1 - 1*1) = i*(-1) - j*(-1) + k*(-1) = (-1,1,-1)

so m' = [ (1,-1,-1), (-1,-1,1), (-1,1,-1) ]

now, det(m') = 1*(-1*(-1) - 1*1) - (-1)*(-1*(-1) - 1*(-1)) + (-1)*(-1*1 - (-1)*(-1))

= 1*(1 - 1) - (-1)*(1 - 1) + (-1)*(-1 - 1)

= 1*0 - (-1)*0 + (-1)*(-2)

= 0 - 0 + 2 = 2

but according to the formula det(m') = d^2 = (-2)^2 = 4, but det(m')=2.

this suggests that the formula det(m')=d^2 is not always correct.

wait, maybe the formula involves the square of the determinant, but scaled by some factor.

alternatively, perhaps the formula is det(m') = d^2 times some factor related to the vectors.

but that seems unlikely.

alternatively, perhaps det(m') = (a·(b×c)) times something.

wait, in my earlier calculation, det(m [a×b, b×c, c×a]^t) = d^3, so det(m') = d^2.

but in this specific case, det(m')=2, d=-2, 2 ≠ (-2)^2=4.

wait, maybe there's a mistake in my calculation of det(m').

let me try computing det(m') again.

m' = [ (1,-1,-1), (-1,-1,1), (-1,1,-1) ]

so the determinant is:

1*(-1*(-1) - 1*1) - (-1)*(-1*(-1) - 1*(-1)) + (-1)*(-1*1 - (-1)*(-1))

= 1*(1 - 1) - (-1)*(1 - 1) + (-1)*(-1 - 1)

= 1*0 - (-1)*0 + (-1)*(-2)

= 0 - 0 + 2 = 2

yes, det(m')=2.

but d=-2, d^2=4, which doesn't match.

hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the general formula.

alternatively, maybe the general formula is det(m') = d^2, but in this specific case, there's some dependency or something that causes it to be different.

alternatively, perhaps the formula is det(m') = d^2 when a, b, c are orthogonal, but not in general.

but in my first example, a, b, c were orthogonal, and det(m')=1=d^2=1.

in the second example, a, b, c were orthogonal in a different way, and det(m')=4=d^2=4.

in the third example, a, b, c are not orthogonal, and det(m')=2≠d^2=4.

so perhaps the formula det(m')=d^2 holds only when a, b, c are orthogonal.

alternatively, perhaps there is a general formula that involves the inverse of m or something similar.

wait, going back to the earlier result: det(m [a×b, b×c, c×a]^t) = d^3, and det(m) det(m') = d^3, so det(m') = d^3 / det(m) = d^2.

but in the third example, this gives det(m')=d^2=4, but in reality det(m')=2.

this inconsistency suggests that the general formula might not be det(m')=d^2, or perhaps i've made a mistake in assuming that det(m [a×b, b×c, c×a]^t)=d^3.

wait, perhaps there is a factor i'm missing.

alternatively, maybe det(m')=d^2 / (a·(b×c)).

but a·(b×c)=d, so that would be d^2 / d = d.

but in the third example, d=-2, and det(m')=2, which is -d.

wait, but d=-2, -d=2, which matches det(m')=2.

in the first example, d=1, -d=-1, but det(m')=1, which doesn't match.

in the second example, d=2, -d=-2, but det(m')=4, which doesn't match.

wait, no, that doesn't work consistently.

alternatively, perhaps det(m') = d^2 / |a·(b×c)|, but that also doesn't resolve the inconsistency.

wait, maybe det(m') = d^2 / (a·(b×c)), but again, in the third example, d=-2, a·(b×c)=d=-2, so d^2 / d = -2, but det(m')=2, not -2.

wait, unless there's an absolute value involved.

if det(m') = |d|^2 / |d| = |d|, then in the third example, |d|=2, det(m')=2, which matches.

in the first example, |d|=1, det(m')=1, matches.

in the second example, |d|=2, det(m')=4, which doesn't match.

hmm, still inconsistent.

wait, maybe det(m') = d^2 / (a·(b×c)), and in the third example, d=-2, a·(b×c)=d=-2, so d^2 / d = -2, but det(m')=2.

wait, but 2 ≠ -2.

hmm.

alternatively, perhaps det(m') = d^2 / (a·(b×c)), but with a sign adjustment.

alternatively, maybe det(m') = d^2 / |a·(b×c)|, but again, that doesn't resolve the sign issue.

this is getting too complicated.

let me consider another approach.

suppose i consider the cross product matrix.

let me denote m = [a b c], and m' = [a×b, b×c, c×a].

i need to find det(m') in terms of det(m).

i recall that in 3d, the cross product can be represented using the hodge star operator, and there are identities involving determinants of such matrices.

alternatively, perhaps i can consider that m' is related to m via the matrix of minors or something similar.

wait, perhaps i can consider that [a×b, b×c, c×a] is equal to m times the adjugate of m, or something like that.

alternatively, perhaps there's a general formula for det([a×b, b×c, c×a]) in terms of det(m).

after some research or recall, i find that det([a×b, b×c, c×a]) = (det[m])^2.

but as shown in my third example, that doesn't hold.

alternatively, perhaps det([a×b, b×c, c×a]) = (det[m])^2 / (a·(b×c)).

but again, that doesn't resolve the inconsistency.

wait, perhaps i need to consider that det(m') = det(m)^2 / (a·(b×c)), but that gives det(m') = d^2 / d = d, which in the third example would be det(m') = -2, but in reality det(m')=2.

so that doesn't match.

alternatively, maybe det(m') = |det(m)|^2 / |a·(b×c)|, which would be |d|^2 / |d| = |d|, giving det(m')=2 in the third example, which matches, but in the first example det(m')=1, which matches |d|=1, and in the second example det(m')=4 vs |d|=2, which doesn't match.

wait, in the second example, d=2, det(m')=4, which is |d|^2=4, but in the third example, d=-2, det(m')=2, which is |d|.

so inconsistent.

alternatively, perhaps det(m') = (a·(b×c)) times something.

but this seems too vague.

alternatively, perhaps det(m') = (a·(b×c))^2 / something.

wait, perhaps det(m') = (a·(b×c))^2 / (a·(b×c)), which is a·(b×c), but that's just d, which doesn't match the examples.

alternatively, perhaps det(m') = (a·(b×c)) times something else.

this is getting too convoluted.

let me consider the general formula again.

from the earlier step, det(m [a×b, b×c, c×a]^t) = d^3.

but m [a×b, b×c, c×a]^t is a matrix whose determinant is d^3.

and det(m [a×b, b×c, c×a]^t) = det(m) det([a×b, b×c, c×a]^t) = det(m) det([a×b, b×c, c×a]).

therefore, det(m) det(m') = d^3.

thus, det(m') = d^3 / det(m) = d^2.

but in my third example, d=-2, det(m')=2, which should be d^2=4, but it's not matching.

wait, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that det(m [a×b, b×c, c×a]^t) = d^3.

let me verify that calculation again.

m is [a b c], [a×b, b×c, c×a]^t is a matrix with rows a×b, b×c, c×a.

then m [a×b, b×c, c×a]^t is:

a·(a×b)   a·(b×c)   a·(c×a)

b·(a×b)   b·(b×c)   b·(c×a)

c·(a×b)   c·(b×c)   c·(c×a)

which is:

0          d          0

0          0          d

d          0          0

then det of this matrix is 0*(0*d - d*0) - d*(0*d - d*d) + 0*(0*0 - 0*d) = -d*(-d^2) = d^3.

so det(m [a×b, b×c, c×a]^t) = d^3.

therefore, det(m) det(m') = d^3, so det(m') = d^3 / det(m) = d^2.

but in my third example, d=-2, det(m')=2, which is not equal to d^2=4.

this suggests that there might be a mistake in assuming that det(m [a×b, b×c, c×a]^t)=d^3 in general.

alternatively, perhaps i need to consider the orientation or the right-hand rule in the cross product definitions.

alternatively, perhaps there is a missing factor of the signature of the permutation of the vectors.

this is getting too complicated for my current level of understanding.

maybe i should consider that the general formula is det(m')=d^2, and in the third example, there might be some dependency or miscalculation.

alternatively, perhaps in the third example, there's a mistake in calculating det(m').

let me try to calculate det(m') again.

m' = [ (1,-1,-1), (-1,-1,1), (-1,1,-1) ]

so the determinant is:

1*(-1*(-1) - 1*1) - (-1)*(-1*(-1) - 1*(-1)) + (-1)*(-1*1 - (-1)*(-1))

= 1*(1 - 1) - (-1)*(1 - 1) + (-1)*(-1 - 1)

= 1*0 - (-1)*0 + (-1)*(-2)

= 0 - 0 + 2 = 2

yes, det(m')=2.

but according to det(m')=d^2=4, which doesn't match.

wait, perhaps the general formula is det(m')=d^2 times some factor, like the reciprocal of something.

alternatively, perhaps det(m')=d^2 times the inverse of a norm or something.

but that seems unlikely.

alternatively, perhaps det(m')=d^2 when m is an orthogonal matrix, but in general, it's different.

but m being orthogonal would require a, b, c to be orthonormal, which they are not in the third example.

alternatively, perhaps det(m')=d^2 for all m, but in the third example, there's a mistake.

alternatively, perhaps the general formula is det(m')=d^2, and in the third example, the calculation of det(m') was wrong.

let me try to calculate det(m') again for the third example.

m' = [ (1,-1,-1), (-1,-1,1), (-1,1,-1) ]

compute the determinant:

= 1*(-1*(-1) - 1*1) - (-1)*(-1*(-1) - 1*(-1)) + (-1)*(-1*1 - (-1)*(-1))

= 1*(1 - 1) - (-1)*(1 - 1) + (-1)*(-1 - 1)

= 1*0 - (-1)*0 + (-1)*(-2)

= 0 - 0 + 2 = 2

still det(m')=2.

but according to det(m')=d^2=4, this is inconsistent.

alternatively, perhaps det(m')=d^2 only when m is orthogonal, which it isn't in the third example.

alternatively, perhaps i need to consider that det(m')=d^2 / (a·(b×c)), but that would be d^2 / d = d, which in this case is -2, but det(m')=2.

wait, but d=-2, and det(m')=2, which is -d.

so maybe det(m')=-d.

but in the first example, d=1, det(m')=1, which is -d=-1, doesn't match.

in the second example, d=2, det(m')=4, which is not -d=-2.

so that doesn't hold.

alternatively, perhaps det(m')=|d|^2 / |a·(b×c)|, but that would be |d|^2 / |d|=|d|, which in the third example is 2, matching det(m')=2, and in the first example, 1, matching det(m')=1, and in the second example, |d|=2 vs det(m')=4, which doesn't match.

wait, in the second example, d=2, det(m')=4, which is not equal to |d|=2.

wait, perhaps det(m')=d^2 when d>0, and det(m')=-d^2 when d<0.

in the first example, d=1>0, det(m')=1=d^2.

in the second example, d=2>0, det(m')=4=d^2.

in the third example, d=-2<0, det(m')=2=-(-2)^2=-4, which is not matching.

wait, det(m')=2, which is not equal to -d^2=-4.

hmm, that doesn't work.

alternatively, perhaps det(m')=d^2 when m is orientation-preserving, and det(m')=-d^2 when m is orientation-reversing.

but in the third example, d=-2, which indicates a reversal of orientation, and det(m')=2, which is not equal to -d^2=-4.

no, that doesn't match.

alternatively, perhaps det(m')=d^2 when m is special orthogonal, but that's not general.

this is getting too complicated.

maybe i should accept that in general, det(m')=d^2, and in the third example, perhaps there's an error in the calculation.

alternatively, perhaps the general formula is det(m')=d^2, and in the third example, the discrepancy arises from the specific choice of vectors.

alternatively, perhaps det(m')=d^2 for all m, and the third example is just a miscalculation.

alternatively, maybe the general formula is det(m')=d^2, and in my third example, det(m') should be d^2=4, but i calculated it as 2, indicating a mistake in my calculation.

let me try to recalculate det(m') for the third example carefully.

m' = [ (1,-1,-1), (-1,-1,1), (-1,1,-1) ]

so the determinant is:

1 * det( [ -1 1 ; 1 -1 ] ) - (-1) * det( [ -1 1 ; -1 -1 ] ) + (-1) * det( [ -1 -1 ; -1 1 ] )

= 1 * ((-1)*(-1) - 1*1) - (-1) * ((-1)*(-1) - 1*(-1)) + (-1) * ((-1)*1 - (-1)*(-1))

= 1*(1 - 1) - (-1)*(1 - (-1)) + (-1)*(-1 - 1)

= 1*0 - (-1)*(2) + (-1)*(-2)

= 0 + 2 + 2 = 4

ah, i see my earlier mistake. i incorrectly calculated the second term as (-1)*(1 - 1)=0, but actually, it's (-1)*(1 - (-1))=(-1)*(2)=-2, and then multiplied by -1 gives +2.

so det(m')=0 + 2 + 2=4, which matches d^2=(-2)^2=4.

therefore, the general formula is det(m')=d^2.

so the answer is k=1, n=2, so (1,2).

**final answer**
