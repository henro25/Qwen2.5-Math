Answer: Given vectors \(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{c}\), we need to find the determinant of the matrix whose column vectors are \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}, \mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}\) in terms of the determinant \(d\) of the matrix with columns \(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{c}\).

first, we denote the original matrix as \(m = [\mathbf{a} \mathbf{b} \mathbf{c}]\), so \(\det(m) = d\).

the new matrix is \(m' = [\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}, \mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}]\), and we need to find \(\det(m')\).

we use the property that \(\det(m' m^t) = d^3\), where \(m^t\) is the transpose of \(m\). this implies:

\[
\det(m') \det(m^t) = d^3
\]

since \(\det(m^t) = \det(m) = d\), we have:

\[
\det(m') \cdot d = d^3 \implies \det(m') = d^2
\]

thus, the determinant of the matrix whose columns are \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}, \mathbf{c} \times \mathbf{a}\) is equal to \(d^2\).

therefore, the ordered pair \((k, n)\) is:

\[
\boxed{(1, 2)}
\]
