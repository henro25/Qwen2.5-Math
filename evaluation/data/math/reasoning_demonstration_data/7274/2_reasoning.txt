Reasoning: So i've got this problem: "for how many integer values of 
n
n between 1 and 349 inclusive does the decimal representation of 
n
350
350
n
​	
  terminate?"

alright, first things first, i need to understand when a fraction has a terminating decimal. i remember that a fraction 
a
b
b
a
​	
  in lowest terms has a terminating decimal if and only if the prime factors of the denominator 
b
b are only 2's and 5's. so, the denominator should be of the form 
2
m
×
5
n
2 
m
 ×5 
n
 , where 
m
m and 
n
n are non-negative integers.

now, in this problem, the fraction is 
n
350
350
n
​	
 , and 
n
n is an integer between 1 and 349, inclusive. i need to find out for how many of these 
n
n the decimal terminates.

first, let's factorize 350 to see its prime factors. 350 divided by 2 is 175, then 175 divided by 5 is 35, and 35 divided by 5 is 7. so, 350 = 2 × 5 × 5 × 7, or 
2
×
5
2
×
7
2×5 
2
 ×7.

but according to the rule, for the decimal to terminate, the denominator in lowest terms should only have 2's and 5's. so, if 
n
350
350
n
​	
  is not in lowest terms, we need to cancel out any common factors between 
n
n and 350.

let’s denote 
d
=
gcd
⁡
(
n
,
350
)
d=gcd(n,350), the greatest common divisor of 
n
n and 350. then, we can write 
n
=
d
×
k
n=d×k and 350 = 
d
×
m
d×m, where 
m
=
350
d
m= 
d
350
​	
 , and 
gcd
⁡
(
k
,
m
)
=
1
gcd(k,m)=1. so, the fraction becomes 
k
m
m
k
​	
 , and for the decimal to terminate, 
m
m should only have 2's and 5's in its prime factorization.

given that 350 = 
2
×
5
2
×
7
2×5 
2
 ×7, the denominator 
m
=
350
d
m= 
d
350
​	
  should not have any factor of 7. that means that 
d
d must include the factor of 7 in 350 to cancel it out in the denominator.

in other words, 
d
d must be a multiple of 7. so, 
d
d must divide 350 and must be a multiple of 7.

let’s find all possible 
d
d that divide 350 and are multiples of 7.

first, find all divisors of 350. since 350 = 
2
×
5
2
×
7
2×5 
2
 ×7, its positive divisors are all numbers of the form 
2
a
×
5
b
×
7
c
2 
a
 ×5 
b
 ×7 
c
 , where 
a
=
0
a=0 or 1, 
b
=
0
,
1
,
b=0,1, or 2, and 
c
=
0
c=0 or 1.

so, the divisors are:

now, from these, the divisors that are multiples of 7 are:

- 7, 35, 175, 14, 70, 350.

so, 
d
d can be 7, 14, 35, 70, 175, or 350.

now, for each possible 
d
d, i need to find the number of 
n
n such that 
gcd
⁡
(
n
,
350
)
=
d
gcd(n,350)=d.

given that 
n
n ranges from 1 to 349 inclusive, and 
d
d divides 350, the number of integers 
n
n with 
gcd
⁡
(
n
,
350
)
=
d
gcd(n,350)=d is equal to 
ϕ
(
350
d
)
ϕ( 
d
350
​	
 ), where 
ϕ
ϕ is euler's totient function.

so, for each 
d
d, compute 
ϕ
(
350
d
)
ϕ( 
d
350
​	
 ), and sum these up.

let’s compute this for each

- 5 is prime.

350
350
​

ϕ
(
1
)
ϕ(1).

- by definition, 
ϕ
(
1
)
=
1
ϕ(1)=1

now, summing these up: 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 50.

wait a minute, but 350 is not included because 
n
n is up to 349. so, 
n
=
350
n=350 is not included, since 350 is not less than or equal to 349.

so, 
d
=
350
d=350 corresponds to 
n
=
350
n=350, which is beyond our range. therefore, we should exclude 
d
=
350
d=350.

thus, the total number is 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 49.

but hold on, i think i might be double-counting or missing something. let me double-check.

alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way to approach this.

let’s consider that for 
n
350
350
n
​	
  to have a terminating decimal, the denominator in lowest terms must only have 2's and 5's.

given that 350 = 
2
×
5
2
×
7
2×5 
2
 ×7, the denominator in lowest terms after canceling common factors with 
n
n should not have any factor of 7.

therefore, 
n
n must be a multiple of 7, so that the 7 in the denominator cancels out.

so, 
n
n must be divisible by 7.

let’s find how many integers between 1 and 349 inclusive are divisible by 7.

the smallest multiple of 7 in this range is 7, and the largest is 349 divided by 7 is approximately 49.857, so the largest multiple is 7 × 49 = 343.

so, the multiples of 7 from 7 to 343 inclusive.

the number of multiples is 
343
−
7
7
+
1
=
336
7
+
1
=
48
+
1
=
49
7
343−7
​	
 +1= 
7
336
​	
 +1=48+1=49.

therefore, there are 49 integer values of 
n
n between 1 and 349 inclusive for which 
n
350
350
n
​	
  has a terminating decimal.

wait, but earlier i got 49 by excluding 
d
=
350
d=350, and this method also gives 49.

so, perhaps 49 is the correct answer.

but i recall that in my earlier approach, i considered 
d
=
7
,
14
,
35
,
70
,
175
,
350
d=7,14,35,70,175,350, and excluded 350, summing up to 49.

but is there any overlap or mistake in that approach?

alternatively, perhaps i can think about it differently.

the condition is that in 
n
350
350
n
​	
 , after simplifying, the denominator has no prime factors other than 2 and 5.

given that 350 = 
2
×
5
2
×
7
2×5 
2
 ×7, so to eliminate the 7, 
n
n must be divisible by 7.

thus, 
n
n must be a multiple of 7.

therefore, the number of such 
n
n is the number of multiples of 7 between 1 and 349 inclusive.

as calculated, that's 49.

alternatively, perhaps i can use the formula for the number of integers in a range divisible by a certain number.

the number of multiples of 7 up to 349 is 
⌊
349
7
⌋
⌊ 
7
349
​	
 ⌋.

349
7
7
349
​	
  is approximately 49.857, so the floor is 49.

therefore, 49 multiples.

hence, the answer is 49.

**final answer**

49
