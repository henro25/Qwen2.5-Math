Reasoning: Alright, so I have this math problem here: "The average of 12, 21, and x is 18. What is the value of x?" Okay, averages, I think I get that. So, average is like, you add up all the numbers and then divide by how many there are, right? So, in this case, there are three numbers: 12, 21, and x. And their average is 18. So, I need to find out what x is.

Let me see. So, average equals the sum of the numbers divided by the count of numbers. So, (12 + 21 + x) divided by 3 equals 18. Yeah, that makes sense. So, to find x, I need to solve for x in that equation.

First, maybe I can get rid of the denominator. So, if I multiply both sides of the equation by 3, that should help. So, 3 times (12 + 21 + x)/3 equals 3 times 18. That simplifies to 12 + 21 + x equals 54. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Yeah, because 3 times 18 is 54.

Okay, so now I have 12 plus 21 plus x equals 54. Let's add 12 and 21 together. 12 plus 21 is 33. So, 33 plus x equals 54. Now, to find x, I just need to subtract 33 from both sides of the equation. So, x equals 54 minus 33. What's 54 minus 33? Let's see, 54 minus 30 is 24, and then minus another 3 is 21. So, x should be 21.

Wait a minute, does that make sense? Let me check. If x is 21, then the numbers are 12, 21, and 21. What's their average? Add them up: 12 plus 21 is 33, plus another 21 is 54. Then divide by 3, which is 18. Yep, that matches the given average. So, x equals 21 seems correct.

But hold on, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the concept that average times the number of items equals the total sum. So, average is 18, and there are 3 numbers, so total sum is 18 times 3, which is 54. Then, sum of the known numbers is 12 plus 21, which is 33. So, x must be 54 minus 33, which is 21. Yeah, that confirms it again.

I guess that's pretty straightforward. I don't see any tricky parts here. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it, but I just want to make sure I understand it fully. So, average is total sum divided by the number of items, and solving for the missing number involves finding what needs to be added to the sum of the known numbers to reach the total sum.

Let me try plugging in x equals 21 into the original problem to double-check. So, the numbers are 12, 21, and 21. Adding them up: 12 plus 21 is 33, plus another 21 is 54. Divide by 3, and yes, that's 18. Perfect.

Is there any other way this could be interpreted? Like, is there a possibility that x could be something else, or that I've missed a step somewhere? I don't think so. It seems pretty clear. Maybe I should consider if there are negative numbers or something, but the numbers given are all positive, and x comes out positive, so that seems fine.

I guess I'm confident with x equals 21 as the answer. It checks out both ways I looked at it.
