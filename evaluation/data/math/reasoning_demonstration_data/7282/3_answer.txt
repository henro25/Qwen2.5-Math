Answer: To find the value of \( x \), we start with the formula for the average of three numbers: 

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{12 + 21 + x}{3}
\]

We are given that the average is 18, so:

\[
\frac{12 + 21 + x}{3} = 18
\]

Multiplying both sides by 3:

\[
12 + 21 + x = 54
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
33 + x = 54
\]

Subtracting 33 from both sides gives:

\[
x = 21
\]

Thus, the value of \( x \) is 21.
