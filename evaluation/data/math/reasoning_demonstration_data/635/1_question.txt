Problem: Let $A = (1,1)$ be a point on the parabola $y = x^2.$  The normal to the parabola at $A$ is drawn, intersecting the parabola again at $B.$  Find $B.$

pair A, B;

A = (1,1);
B = (-3/2,9/4);

real parab (real x) {
  return(x^2);

draw(graph(parab,-2,2));
draw((A + (-1,-2))--(A + (1,2)));
draw((A + (1,-0.5))--(A + (-3,1.5)));

dot("$B$", B, SW);

Note: The normal at a point $P$ on a curve $\mathcal{C}$ is the line passing through $P$ that is perpendicular to the tangent to $\mathcal{C}$ at $P.$
