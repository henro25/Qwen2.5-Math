Problem: Robert likes chocolate milk, so he decides to visit the milk bottling plant every day for a week to get the free samples. Unfortunately for him, the bottling plant sometimes bottles regular milk instead of chocolate milk, so each day the plant has a 2/3 chance of bottling chocolate milk. What is the probability that the bottling plant bottles chocolate milk exactly 4 of the 5 days he visits?
