Answer: George has a quadratic of the form \( x^2 + bx + \frac{1}{3} \), where \( b \) is a specific negative number. he rewrites this quadratic in the form \( (x + m)^2 + \frac{1}{12} \).

first, we expand \( (x + m)^2 \):

\[
(x + m)^2 = x^2 + 2mx + m^2
\]

so, the quadratic becomes:

\[
(x + m)^2 + \frac{1}{12} = x^2 + 2mx + m^2 + \frac{1}{12}
\]

we equate this to the original quadratic:

\[
x^2 + bx + \frac{1}{3} = x^2 + 2mx + m^2 + \frac{1}{12}
\]

by comparing coefficients, we get:

1. the coefficient of \( x \): \( b = 2m \)
2. the constant term: \( \frac{1}{3} = m^2 + \frac{1}{12} \)

solving for \( m^2 \):

\[
m^2 = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{12} = \frac{4}{12} - \frac{1}{12} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

thus, \( m = \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

since \( b \) is negative, we choose \( m = -\frac{1}{2} \):

\[
b = 2m = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = -1
\]

therefore, the value of \( b \) is:

\[
\boxed{-1}
\]
