Reasoning: Let's see here. i've got this quadratic equation: 
x
2
+
b
x
+
1
3
x 
2
 +bx+ 
3
1
​	
 , and i know that 
b
b is a negative number. george was able to rewrite this quadratic in the form 
(
x
+
m
)
2
+
1
12
(x+m) 
2
 + 
12
1
​	
 . i need to find out what 
b
b is.

first, i recall that completing the square is a method to rewrite a quadratic equation in the form of a perfect square plus some constant. the general form is 
(
x
+
m
)
2
+
k
(x+m) 
2
 +k, where 
m
m and 
k
k are constants.

so, starting with 
x
2
+
b
x
+
1
3
x 
2
 +bx+ 
3
1
​	
 , i want to express this as 
(
x
+
m
)
2
+
1
12
(x+m) 
2
 + 
12
1
​	
 .

let me expand 
(
x
+
m
)
2
(x+m) 
2
  to see what it looks like:

(
x
+
m
)
2
=
x
2
+
2
m
x
+
m
2
(x+m) 
2
 =x 
2
 +2mx+m 
2
 

so, 
(
x
+
m
)
2
+
1
12
=
x
2
+
2
m
x
+
m
2
+
1
12
(x+m) 
2
 + 
12
1
​	
 =x 
2
 +2mx+m 
2
 + 
12
1
​	
 

now, this should be equal to the original quadratic:

x
2
+
b
x
+
1
3
=
x
2
+
2
m
x
+
m
2
+
1
12
x 
2
 +bx+ 
3
1
​	
 =x 
2
 +2mx+m 
2
 + 
12
1
​	
 

since the quadratics are equal for all 
x
x, their corresponding coefficients must be equal.

comparing the coefficients:

1. the coefficient of 
x
2
x 
2
  is 1 on both sides, so that matches.

2. the coefficient of 
x
x on the left is 
b
b, and on the right, it's 
2
m
2m. so, 
b
=
2
m
b=2m.

3. the constant term on the left is 
1
3
3
1
​	
 , and on the right, it's 
m
2
+
1
12
m 
2
 + 
12
1
​	
 . so, 
1
3
=
m
2
+
1
12
3
1
​	
 =m 
2
 + 
12
1
​	
 .

now, i can use these two equations to solve for 
m
m and 
b
b.

first, from 
b
=
2
m
b=2m, i can express 
m
m in terms of 
b
b: 
m
=
b
2
m= 
2
b
​	
 .

but maybe it's easier to solve for 
m
m first using the constant term equation.

so, from 
1
3
=
m
2
+
1
12
3
1
​	
 =m 
2
 + 
12
1
​	
 , let's solve for 
m
2
m 
2
 :

m
2
=
1
3
−
1
12
m 
2
 = 
3
1
​	
 − 
12
1
​	
 

to subtract these fractions, they need a common denominator. the common denominator of 3 and 12 is 12.

so, 
1
3
=
4
12
3
1
​	
 = 
12
4
​	
 , and 
1
12
12
1
​	
  remains the same.

thus, 
m
2
=
4
12
−
1
12
=
3
12
=
1
4
m 
2
 = 
12
4
​	
 − 
12
1
​	
 = 
12
3
​	
 = 
4
1
​	
 

therefore, 
m
2
=
1
4
m 
2
 = 
4
1
​	
 , which means 
m
=
±
1
2
m=± 
2
1
​	
 

but since 
b
b is a specific negative number, and 
b
=
2
m
b=2m, if 
m
=
1
2
m= 
2
1
​	
 , then 
b
=
1
b=1, which is positive, but we need 
b
b to be negative. so, 
m
m must be 
−
1
2
− 
2
1
​	
 , and thus 
b
=
2
×
(
−
1
2
)
=
−
1
b=2×(− 
2
1
​	
 )=−1.

wait a minute, but i should check if this makes sense in the original equation.

let me plug 
m
=
−
1
2
m=− 
2
1
​	
  back into the completed square form and see if it matches the original quadratic.

so, 
(
x
−
1
2
)
2
+
1
12
(x− 
2
1
​	
 ) 
2
 + 
12
1
​	
 

expanding this:

x
2
−
x
+
1
4
+
1
12
=
x
2
−
x
+
3
12
+
1
12
=
x
2
−
x
+
4
12
=
x
2
−
x
+
1
3
x 
2
 −x+ 
4
1
​	
 + 
12
1
​	
 =x 
2
 −x+ 
12
3
​	
 + 
12
1
​	
 =x 
2
 −x+ 
12
4
​	
 =x 
2
 −x+ 
3
1
​	
 

yes, that matches the original quadratic 
x
2
+
b
x
+
1
3
x 
2
 +bx+ 
3
1
​	
  when 
b
=
−
1
b=−1.

so, 
b
=
−
1
b=−1 seems to be the correct answer.

but just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other possible values for 
m
m and hence for 
b
b.

we found that 
m
=
±
1
2
m=± 
2
1
​	
 , but as i saw earlier, 
m
=
1
2
m= 
2
1
​	
  would lead to 
b
=
1
b=1, which is positive, contradicting the condition that 
b
b is a specific negative number. therefore, the only valid solution is 
m
=
−
1
2
m=− 
2
1
​	
 , leading to 
b
=
−
1
b=−1.

therefore, 
b
=
−
1
b=−1 is the answer.
