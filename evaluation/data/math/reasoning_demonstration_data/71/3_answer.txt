Answer: The given equation is:

\[
(x + 5)^2 = (4y - 3)^2 - 140
\]

First, we simplify and rearrange the equation:

\[
(x + 5)^2 - (4y - 3)^2 = -140
\]

Dividing both sides by -140:

\[
-\frac{(x + 5)^2}{140} + \frac{(4y - 3)^2}{140} = 1
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{(4y - 3)^2}{140} - \frac{(x + 5)^2}{140} = 1
\]

This is in the standard form of a hyperbola:

\[
\frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} - \frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} = 1
\]

Thus, the equation represents a hyperbola.

The answer is:

\[
\boxed{H}
\]
