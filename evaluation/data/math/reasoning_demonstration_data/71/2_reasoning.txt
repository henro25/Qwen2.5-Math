Reasoning: Alright, so I've got this equation here: (x + 5)^2 = (4y - 3)^2 - 140. I need to figure out what type of conic section this represents. The options are circle, parabola, ellipse, hyperbola, or none of the above, and I have to enter "C", "P", "E", "H", or "N" accordingly.

First, I should probably expand both sides to see if I can simplify this equation. Let's see, expanding (x + 5)^2 gives x^2 + 10x + 25. On the right side, (4y - 3)^2 is 16y^2 - 24y + 9. So the equation becomes:

x^2 + 10x + 25 = 16y^2 - 24y + 9 - 140.

Simplifying the right side: 16y^2 - 24y + 9 - 140 = 16y^2 - 24y - 131.

So now the equation is:

x^2 + 10x + 25 = 16y^2 - 24y - 131.

I can move everything to one side to set the equation to zero:

x^2 + 10x + 25 - 16y^2 + 24y + 131 = 0.

Combining like terms:

x^2 + 10x - 16y^2 + 24y + 156 = 0.

Hmm, this looks like a general second-degree equation. To identify the conic section, I recall that the general form is:

Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0.

In this case, A = 1, B = 0, C = -16, D = 10, E = 24, F = 156.

I think there's a discriminant that can help identify the type of conic. The discriminant is B^2 - 4AC. Let me calculate that:

B^2 - 4AC = 0^2 - 4*(1)*(-16) = 0 + 64 = 64.

Now, I need to remember what the discriminant tells us:

- If B^2 - 4AC < 0, it's an ellipse (or a circle if A = C and B = 0).

- If B^2 - 4AC = 0, it's a parabola.

- If B^2 - 4AC > 0, it's a hyperbola.

In this case, the discriminant is 64, which is greater than 0, so it should be a hyperbola.

But wait, let me double-check. The standard form for a hyperbola is either (x-h)^2/a^2 - (y-k)^2/b^2 = 1 or (y-k)^2/b^2 - (x-h)^2/a^2 = 1.

Looking back at the original equation: (x + 5)^2 = (4y - 3)^2 - 140.

Maybe I can rearrange it to look more like the standard hyperbola form.

Let's move everything to one side:

(x + 5)^2 - (4y - 3)^2 = -140.

So, (x + 5)^2 - (4y - 3)^2 = -140.

To make it look like the standard form, I can divide both sides by -140:

[(x + 5)^2]/(-140) - [(4y - 3)^2]/(-140) = 1.

Which simplifies to:

-[(x + 5)^2]/140 + [(4y - 3)^2]/140 = 1.

Or:

[(4y - 3)^2]/140 - [(x + 5)^2]/140 = 1.

This looks like the standard form of a hyperbola that opens upwards and downwards because the y-term is positive.

So, yes, it should be a hyperbola.

I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, but maybe I should consider if it could be another type of conic.

Could it be a parabola? Well, in a parabola, one variable is squared and the other is not, but here both x and y are squared.

Could it be a circle? No, because in a circle, the coefficients of x^2 and y^2 are equal and positive, but here they have different coefficients and opposite signs.

Ellipse? No, for an ellipse, both squared terms are positive and the right side is positive, but here they have opposite signs.

So, I'm pretty confident it's a hyperbola.
