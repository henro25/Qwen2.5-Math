Answer: To find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( f(100) \) and \( f(101) \) for the function \( f(x) = x^2 - x + 2010 \), we first compute \( f(100) \) and \( f(101) \):

\[
f(100) = 100^2 - 100 + 2010 = 10000 - 100 + 2010 = 11910
\]

\[
f(101) = 101^2 - 101 + 2010 = 10201 - 101 + 2010 = 12110
\]

next, we use the euclidean algorithm to find the gcd of 11910 and 12110:

1. \( 12110 \div 11910 = 1 \) with remainder \( 200 \)
2. \( 11910 \div 200 = 59 \) with remainder \( 110 \)
3. \( 200 \div 110 = 1 \) with remainder \( 90 \)
4. \( 110 \div 90 = 1 \) with remainder \( 20 \)
5. \( 90 \div 20 = 4 \) with remainder \( 10 \)
6. \( 20 \div 10 = 2 \) with remainder \( 0 \)

the last non-zero remainder is 10, so the gcd is 10.

to confirm, we factorize 11910 and 12110:

\[
11910 = 2 \times 5 \times 3 \times 397
\]

\[
12110 = 2 \times 5 \times 7 \times 173
\]

the common prime factors are 2 and 5, thus:

\[
\text{gcd} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

therefore, the greatest common divisor of \( f(100) \) and \( f(101) \) is \(\boxed{10}\).
